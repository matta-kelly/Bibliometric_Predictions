It inevitably requires understanding the dynamics of platforms and ecosystems. These challenges are amplified for enabling technologies, which are the central focus of this article. The innovator of an enabling technology has a special business model challenge because the applicability to many downstream verticals forecloses, as a practical matter, ownership of all the relevant complements. Complementary assets (vertical and lateral) in the digital context are no longer just potential value-capture mechanisms (through asset price appreciation or through preventing exposure to monopolistic bottleneck pricing by others); they may well be needed simply for the technology to function. Technological and innovational complementors present both coordination and market design challenges to the innovator that generally lead to market failure in the form of an excess of social over private returns. The low private return leads to socially sub-optimal underinvestment in future R&D that can be addressed to some extent by better strategic decision-making by the innovator and/or by far-sighted policies from government and the judiciary. The default value-capture mechanism for many enabling technologies is the licensing of trade secrets and/or patents. Licensing is shown to be a difficult business model to implement from a value-capture perspective. When injunctions for intellectual property infringement are hard to win, or even to be considered, the incentives for free riding by potential licensees are considerable. Licensing is further complicated if it involves standard essential patents, as both courts and policy makers may fail to understand that development of a standard involves components of both interoperability and technology development. If a technology standard is not treated as the embodiment of significant R&D efforts enabling substantial new downstream economic activity, then rewards are likely to be calibrated too low to support appropriate levels of future innovation.","[Teece, David J.] UC, Haas Sch Business, Inst Business Innovat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",,"Teece, DJ (corresponding author), UC, Haas Sch Business, Inst Business Innovat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",teece@haas.berkeley.edu,"Teece, David/A-2868-2013",,"Tusher Center for Intellectual Capital in the Institute for Business Innovation at the Haas School, U.C.

While efficiency gains from increased competition significantly enhance consumer surplus, for instance, by leading to lower average selling prices, our present research shows that increased product variety made available through electronic markets can be a significantly larger source of consumer surplus gains.. One reason for increased product variety on the Internet is the ability of online retailers to catalog, recommend, and provide a large number of products for sale. For example, the number of book titles available at Amazon.com is more than 23 times larger than the number of books on the shelves of a typical Barnes & Noble superstore, and 57 times greater than the number of books stocked in a typical large independent bookstore. Our analysis indicates that the increased product variety of online bookstores enhanced consumer welfare by $731 million to $1.03 billion in the year 2000, which is between 7 and 10 times as large as the consumer welfare gain from increased competition and lower prices in this market. There may also be large welfare gains in other SKU-intensive consumer goods such as music, movies, consumer electronics, and computer software and hardware.","MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Sch Publ Policy & Management, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Carnegie Mellon University,"MIT, Alfred P Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",erikb@mit.edu; yuhu@mit.edu; mds@cmu.edu,"Smith, Michael D/B-7307-2008; Brynjolfsson, Erik/H-2412-2012","Smith, Michael/0000-0001-6844-7923; Smith, Michael/0000-0002-6706-9382",,,,,47,566,686,57,498,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",0025-1909,1526-5501,,MANAGE SCI,Manage.

Smart contracts can find a wide spectrum of potential application scenarios in the digital economy and intelligent industries, including financial services, management, healthcare, and Internet of Things, among others, and also have been integrated into the mainstream blockchain-based development platforms, such as Ethereum and Hyperledger. However, smart contracts are still far from mature, and major technical challenges such as security and privacy issues are still awaiting further research efforts. For instance, the most notorious case might be The DAO Attack in June 2016, which led to more than $50 million Ether transferred into an adversary's account. In this paper, we strive to present a systematic and comprehensive overview of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, aiming at stimulating further research toward this emerging research area. We first introduced the operating mechanism and mainstream platforms of blockchain-enabled smart contracts, and proposed a research framework for smart contracts based on a novel six-layer architecture. Second, both the technical and legal challenges, as well as the recent research progresses, are listed. Third, we presented several typical application scenarios. Toward the end, we discussed the future development trends of smart contracts.

We provide an overview of the empirical literature on ICT and productivity and highlight the main results and methodological differences. The majority of studies indicates that the productivity effect of ICT is indeed positive and significant. However, methodological approaches of how to appropriately estimate the ICT effect matter. While aggregate and sectoral growth accounting exercises suggest stronger differences of the ICT effect between US and Europe, firm-level analyses suggest no significant country differences. Moreover, we shed light on the notion of ICT being a General Propose Technology (GPT) enabling further innovations. Most of the GPT evidence on ICT is found for the US, while evidence for European countries is harder to come by. However, more theoretical and empirical research is needed to better understand spillovers and externalities of ICT and how these technologies transform our economies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This research examines how institution-based trust develops in online B2B marketplaces to facilitate interorganizational trust (buyers' trust in sellers). Building upon the notion of institutional trust [Zucker,1986], this study proposes how specific institution-based structures help engender interorganizational trust and indirectly influence transaction success in B2B marketplaces. Five specific institution-based mechanisms are proposed-perceived monitoring. perceived legal bonds, perceived accreditation, perceived feedback. and perceived cooperative norms. To assess the influence of the proposed two dimensions of interorganizational trust-credibility and benevolence-in buyer-seller relationships, three trust outcomes are examined-satisfaction, perceived risk, and continuity. The proposed model is tested on data from 102 organizational buyers in an online B2B marketplace. The results support the proposed model. delineating the relationship between institution-based trust and interorganizational trust. The study provides evidence on how specific institutional mechanisms build trust in online B2B marketplaces. stressing the ability of institution-based trust to build a trustworthy trading environment in the digital economy.

Through a systematic literature review, a holistic business model framework is developed, which is then used to analyse the empirical evidence from the creative industries. The research found that digital technologies have facilitated pervasive changes in business models, and some significant trends have emerged. However, the reconfigured business models are often not 'new' in the unprecedented sense. Business model innovations are primarily reflected in using digital technologies to enable the deployment of a wider range of business models than previously available to a firm. A significant emerging trend is the increasing adoption of multiple business models as a portfolio within one firm. This is happening in firms of all sizes, when one firm uses multiple business models to serve different markets segments, sell different products, or engage with multi-sided markets, or to use different business models over time. The holistic business model framework is refined and extended through a recursive learning process, which can serve both as a cognitive instrument for understanding business models and a planning tool for business model innovations. The paper contributes to our understanding of the theory of business models and how digital technologies facilitate business model innovations in the creative industries.

Marketplace like Airbnb or Uber offer such digital platforms to connect previously unmatched demand-side and supply-side participants through innovative forms of value creation, delivery and capture. While countless firms claim to offer the next 'Airbnb for X' or 'Uber for Y', we lack knowledge about the defining business model characteristics of these marketplaces. To close the gap, this paper provides a conceptually and empirically grounded taxonomy of their business models. Applying a mixed methods approach, it first develops an integrative framework of marketplace business models. Guided by the framework, the research systematically analyzes 100 randomly selected marketplaces with content analysis and binary coding. The gathered data is analyzed with cluster analysis techniques to develop a taxonomy for marketplace business models. The clustering process reveals six clearly distinguishable types of marketplace business models and thus shows that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating, delivering, and capturing value with marketplaces and platforms in general. We characterize these distinctive types on basis of the qualitative and quantitative findings. Among others, we find that two of these types are highly aligned with business model characteristics associated with the so-called sharing economy. The findings are discussed against platform, marketplace, and sharing economy literature to contribute to a higher integration of different literature streams that are concerned with similar organizational types and phenomena.

Due to the different specifics of the legislative bases of the investigated regions, such as the USA, China, EU, and Africa, the development of digital transformation is presented on the example of the Russian Federation in the context of world trends. The article presents an analysis of the possibilities of using straight-through digital technology in prospecting, design, development, and use of mineral resources. It describes a structure promoting the development of applied digital technology through research-education centers and international competence centers. This structure would allow forming the new competencies for personnel working in the digital economy. The underfunding of the information and computing infrastructure could be a significant challenge to the digital transformation of the economy. Creating the conditions for a reliable and secure process of generating, storing, and using data is the basis for protection from the cybersecurity hazard that could act as a brake on technology advancement. This article discusses the organizational and technological priorities of the development of the mineral resource sector on the example of the Russian Federation. The challenges for the mineral resource complex resulting from global changes can be taken on through technological changes of the industry. The article gives a thorough description of issues related to technological developments in the raw materials sector, oil refining industry, development of integrated and advanced mineral processing systems, and the use of household and industrial wastes. The research presents basic technology contributing to sustainable development, starting from exploration and production forecasting and up to sustainable planning and distribution of material and energy resources based on real-time data. It also pays special attention to the possibilities of creating digital platforms for the mineral sector. Digital integration, combining research areas, personnel, processes, users, and data will create conditions for scientific and technological achievements and breakthroughs, providing scientific and economic developments in related industries and, above all, in the global mineral and raw materials market.","[Litvinenko, V.

One of the richest and most powerful tools in social communication is the face, from which observers can quickly and easily make a number of inferences about identity, gender, sex, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, physical health, attractiveness, emotional state, personality traits, pain or physical pleasure, deception, and even social status. With the advent of the digital economy, increasing globalization and cultural integration, understanding precisely which face information supports social communication and which produces misunderstanding is central to the evolving needs of modern society (for example, in the design of socially interactive digital avatars and companion robots). Doing so is challenging, however, because the face can be thought of as comprising a high-dimensional, dynamic information space, and this impacts cognitive science and neuroimaging, and their broader applications in the digital economy. New opportunities to address this challenge are arising from the development of new methods and technologies, coupled with the emergence of a modern scientific culture that embraces cross-disciplinary approaches. Here, we briefly review one such approach that combines state-of-the-art computer graphics, psychophysics and vision science, cultural psychology and social cognition, and highlight the main knowledge advances it has generated. In the light of current developments, we provide a vision of the future directions in the field of human facial communication within and across cultures.","[Jack, Rachael E.; Schyns, Philippe G.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Psychol, Glasgow G12 8QB, Lanark, Scotland; [Jack, Rachael E.; Schyns, Philippe G.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Neurosci & Psychol, Glasgow G12 8QB, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of Glasgow,"Jack, RE (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Psychol, Glasgow G12 8QB, Lanark, Scotland.",Rachael.Jack@glasgow.ac.uk; Philippe.Schyns@glasgow.ac.uk,"Jack, Rachael/A-4692-2012; Schyns, Philippe/AAT-6989-2020","Schyns, Philippe/0000-0002-8542-7489","Economic and Social Research Council; Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) [ESRC/MRC-060-25-0010, ES/K001973/1, ES/K00607X/1]; British Academy [SG113332]; ESRC [ES/K001973/1, ES/K00607X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K00607X/1, ES/K001973/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); British Academy; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The Economic and Social Research Council and Medical Research Council (United Kingdom; ESRC/MRC-060-25-0010; ES/K001973/1 and ES/K00607X/1), and British Academy (SG113332) supported this work.",,185,198,218,4,133,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",0960-9822,1879-0445,,CURR BIOL,Curr.

We articulate the platform logic as a conceptual framework for both viewing the organizing of IT management activities as well as for framing important questions for future research. In articulating this logic, we aim to shift thinking away from the traditional focus on governance structures (i.e., choice of centralized, decentralized, or federal forms) and sourcing structures (i.e., insourcing, outsourcing) and toward more complex structures that are reflective of contemporary practice.

This paper aims to explore the development process of digital transformation through an e-banking project based on the resource fit concept. Design/methodology/approach - The qualitative method of case study is applied. In total, 17 in-depth interviews and secondary data were collected and analyzed. Findings - Numerous researches related to e-banking have focused on either the resource-based theory or strategic fit perspective, but not on both. This paper makes a unique contribution by constructing a resource fit framework that integrates these two theories. This framework offers a theoretical advancement in the resource fit literature. It includes four dimensions: external resource fit, internal resource fit, external capability fit, and internal capability fit. Through an actual empirical case examination of the resource fit framework, this study explored eight critical factors necessary for successful e-banking project implementation. Research limitations/implications - This study fills a theoretical gap by developing an integrative framework and evaluating it via an empirical case study. Hence, examining this framework for organizational digital transformation in different industries and multiple case studies with cross-cases comparison will be valuable for future research. Practical implications - The study demonstrated that managing digital transformation can be challenging, but awareness of, and preparedness for, analysis of both the resources/capability and external demands through the resource fit perspective are necessary.

These include cloud, big data, blockchain, and artificial intelligence (AI). For instance, access to distributed ledgers (blockchain) and big data supported by cloud-based analytics tools and AI will automate decision making to a large extent. These technologies may significantly improve financial visibility and allow more timely intervention due to the perpetual nature of accounting. However, given the number of tasks technology has relieved of accountants, these technologies may also lead to concerns about the profession's legitimacy. The findings suggest that scholars have not given sufficient attention to these technologies and how these technologies affect the everyday work of accountants. Research is urgently needed to understand the new kinds of accounting required to manage firms in the changing digital economy and to determine the new skills and competencies accountants may need to master to remain relevant and add value.

Design/methodology/approach This paper uses simple descriptive analysis to examine the COVID-19 situation in Nigeria. Findings The findings reveal that the economic downturn in Nigeria was triggered by a combination of declining oil price and spillovers from the COVID-19 outbreak, which not only led to a fall in the demand for oil products but also stopped economic activities from taking place when social distancing policies were enforced. The government responded to the crisis by providing financial assistance to businesses and a small number of households that were affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The monetary authority adopted accommodative monetary policies and offered a targeted 3.5 trillion loan support to some sectors. These efforts should have prevented the economic crisis from occurring but it did not. Economic agents could not freely engage in economic activities for fear of contracting the COVID-19 disease that was spreading very fast at the time. Practical implications The implication of the study is that policymakers should pay attention to three areas of the economy for economic and structural reform. One, policymakers should introduce economic reforms to diversify the economy and reduce Nigeria's dependence on revenue from crude oil export. Two, policymakers in Nigeria should invest in healthcare infrastructure to improve the ability of the national health system to withstand the outbreak of contagious diseases.

In part this is due to the increasing use of auction models in business and consumer markets to sell commodities, excess inventories, used merchandise, rare items collectibles, and other items. Marketers are resorting to dynamic prices even for goods and services sold at posted prices, spurred partly by the lower menu cost of changing prices on the Internet and partly os a response to consumer use of price-comparison bets. This paper explains the relevance of dynamic pricing in the digital economy by comparing the physical value chain with the virtual-information-based value chain. It explores the implications of certain aspects of dynamic pricing in consumer markets (e.g., dynamic pricing of posted prices, reverse auction pricing of goods and services as used by Priceline) from the perspective of consumer price expectations, the role of information and consumer learning, and their impact on consumer responses to prices across different product categories. Several propositions are developed, and issues for research are identified.","Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, Ctr E Serv, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; Dartmouth Coll, Amos Tuck Sch Business Adm, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Dartmouth College; University of Arizona,"Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, Ctr E Serv, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",pkannan@rhsmith.umd.edu; kopalle@dartmouth.edu,"Kannan, Pallassana K/D-8192-2011",,,,,,49,159,180,6,104,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1086-4415,1557-9301,,INT J ELECTRON COMM,Int.

This paper shows how an intermediary can eliminate the moral hazard problem by providing optimal insurance to the lender and first-best incentives to the renter to exert care, as long as market participants are risk neutral. The solution is illustrated for the collaborative housing market but applies in principle to any sharing market with vertically differentiated goods. A population of renters, heterogeneous both in their preferences for housing quality and with respect to the amount of care they exert in a rental situation, face a choice between collaborative housing and staying at a local hotel. The private hosts choose their prices strategically, and the intermediary sets commission rates on both sides of the market as well as insurance terms for the rental agreement. The latter are set to eliminate moral hazard. The intermediary is able to extract the gains the hosts would earn if transacting directly. Finally, even if hotels set their prices at the outset so as to maximize collusive profits, collaborative housing persists at substantial market shares, regardless of the difference between the efficiencies of hosts and hotels to reduce renters' cost of effort. The aggregate of hosts, intermediary, and hotels benefits from (a variety in) these effort costs, which indicates that the intermediated sharing of goods is an economically viable, robust phenomenon.","[Weber, Thomas A.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne EPFL, Management Technol & Entrepreneurship Inst, Operat Econ & Strategy, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Weber, Thomas A.] Boston Consulting Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Boston Consulting Group (BCG),"Weber, TA (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne EPFL, Management Technol & Entrepreneurship Inst, Operat Econ & Strategy, Lausanne, Switzerland.",,"Weber, Thomas A./C-3892-2018","Weber, Thomas A./0000-0003-2857-4754",,,,,50,155,171,9,311,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0742-1222,1557-928X,,J MANAGE INFORM SYST,J.

We invoke Simon's (Proc Am Philos Soc 106(6):467-482, 1962) near-decomposability concept to explain how digitalization enables two distinct types of FSAs - technology and human capital. Applying the ideas of modularity and skill complexity, we further distinguish between core versus peripheral technology FSAs and between generic versus advanced human capital FSAs. Building on the transferability and appropriability of these strategic assets, we theorize on the FSAs' internalization propensity in the digital age. We propose that with rising digitalization, the network plays a dual role - as a governance mode and as a strategic resource. Integrating insights from network economics, particularly increasing returns to scale, we propose that network advantages (O-n) emerge as a distinct strategic resource that merits separate investigation from the traditional asset-based (O-a) and transaction-based (O-t) advantages.","[Banalieva, Elitsa R.] Northeastern Univ, DAmore McKim Sch Business, Int Business & Strategy Grp, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Dhanaraj, Charles] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Northeastern University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Banalieva, ER (corresponding author), Northeastern Univ, DAmore McKim Sch Business, Int Business & Strategy Grp, Boston, MA 02115 USA.",e.banalieva@northeastern.edu,"Banalieva, Elitsa R/KHW-1430-2024; Dhanaraj, Charles/JSK-8534-2023; N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023","Banalieva, Elitsa R/0000-0003-2293-654X; Dhanaraj, Charles/0000-0003-2969-8759;",,,,,92,145,159,105,566,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0047-2506,1478-6990,,J INT BUS STUD,J.

The number of firms disclosing items concerning their information security on reports filed with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has increased in recent years. A question then arises as to whether or not there is value to the voluntary disclosures concerning information security. Thus, the primary objective of this paper is to assess empirically the market value of voluntary disclosures of items pertaining to information security. Based on a sample of 1,641 disclosing and 19,266 non-disclosing firm-years in a cross-sectional pooled model, our primary findings provide strong evidence that voluntarily disclosing items concerning information security is associated positively with the market value of a firm. These findings are based on the use of a market-value relevance model, as well as a bid-ask spread analysis. The study's findings are robust to alternative statistical analyses. The findings also provide support for the signaling argument, which states that managers disclose information in a manner consistent with increased firm value. Finally, the study findings provide some insight into the strategic choice that firms make regarding voluntary disclosures about information security.","[Gordon, Lawrence A.; Loeb, Martin P.] Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Sohail, Tashfeen] IE Business Sch, Madrid 28006, Spain",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; IE University,"Gordon, LA (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, 4332F Munching Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",lgordon@rhsmith.umd.edu; mloeb@rhsmith.umd.edu; Tashfeen.Sohail@ie.edu,,,Spanish Ministry of Education [SEJ-2007-67582-C02-02645],Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government),"We would like to thank Soeren Hvidkjaer, Christian Leuz, Allen Schick, Partha Sengupta, Robert Verrecchia, Amanda Wilford, and Wenjie Zhu for their comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

Few scholars, however, have examined the possibility that a large segment of the population is apprehensive about the quick pace of technological change and encroachment into modern life. Drawing from economic projections about the future of the digital economy and from literature in the sociology of technology and emotions, this article explores whether certain fears of technology exacerbate fears of unemployment and financial insecurity. Using data from Wave 2 of the Chapman Survey of American Fears (N = 1,541), I find that there exists a sizable population of technophobes or those who fear robots, AI, and technology they do not understand. Technophobes are also more likely than nontechnophobes to report having anxiety-related mental health issues and to fear unemployment and financial insecurity. With advances in robotics and AI, the threat of technological unemployment is discussed as a real concern among a substantial portion of the American population.","[McClure, Paul K.] Baylor Univ, Dept Sociol, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Baylor University,"McClure, PK (corresponding author), Baylor Univ, One Bear Pl 97326, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",paul_mcclure@baylor.edu,"McClure, Paul/ITW-1169-2023","McClure, Paul/0000-0003-3315-7429",,,,,57,138,158,35,314,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0894-4393,1552-8286,,SOC SCI COMPUT REV,Soc.

This study explores the extent to which teleworking reduces the need to travel to work and the consequent impacts on economy-wide energy consumption. The paper provides a systematic review of the current state of knowledge of the energy impacts of teleworking. This includes the energy savings from reduced commuter travel and the indirect impacts on energy consumption associated with changes in non-work travel and home energy consumption. The aim is to identify the conditions under which teleworking leads to a net reduction in economy-wide energy consumption, and the circumstances where benefits may be outweighed by unintended impacts. The paper synthesises the results of 39 empirical studies, identified through a comprehensive search of 9000 published articles. Twenty six of the 39 studies suggest that teleworking reduces energy use, and only eight studies suggest that teleworking increases, or has a neutral impact on energy use. However, differences in the methodology, scope and assumptions of the different studies make it difficult to estimate 'average' energy savings. The main source of savings is the reduced distance travelled for commuting, potentially with an additional contribution from lower office energy consumption. However, the more rigorous studies that include a wider range of impacts (e.g. non-work travel or home energy use) generally find smaller savings. Despite the generally positive verdict on teleworking as an energy-saving practice, there are numerous uncertainties and ambiguities about its actual or potential benefits. These relate to the extent to which teleworking may lead to unpredictable increases in non-work travel and home energy use that may outweigh the gains from reduced work travel. The available evidence suggests that economy-wide energy savings are typically modest, and in many circumstances could be negative or non-existent.","[Hook, Andrew] Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Sovacool, Benjamin K.; Sorrell, Steve] Univ Sussex, Business Sch, Sci Policy Res Unit SPRU, Jubilee Bldg, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England; [Court, Victor] IFP Sch, Energies Nouvelles, 1&4 Ave Bois Preau, F-92852 Rueil Malmaison, France; [Court, Victor] Inst Louis Bachelier, Chair Energy & Prosper, 28 Pl Bourse, F-75002 Paris, France",University of Sussex; University of Sussex; IFP Energies Nouvelles,"Hook, A (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Global Studies, Dept Geog, Falmer BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England.",a.hook@sussex.ac.uk,"Sovacool, Benjamin/Y-2392-2019","Sovacool, Benjamin/0000-0002-4794-9403",UK Research and Innovation [EP/R035288/1]; EPSRC [EP/R035288/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Research and Innovation(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This work was supported by UK Research and Innovation, through a grant to the Centre for Research on Energy Demand Solutions (Grant Numbers EP/R035288/1).

Starting from a series of elementary indicators the methodology groups these indicators into six factors of digitalization and, subsequently, aggregates the factors in a synthetic index called the synthetic index of digitalization. The dispersion in the distribution of the synthetic indexes of digitalization constitutes the measure of the digital divide. This method is based upon a measurement approach, which is different from the ones previously developed, since it uses principal components analysis for aggregating the variables and avoids many of the problems and limits shown by existing models. In the article an application of the methodology is provided within a set of ten developed countries for 2000 and 2001. The measurement framework for the digital divide presented here reveals new policy implications for public institutions and highlights opportunities and risks for managers working in the 'digital economy' environment.","Bocconi Univ, Res Ctr Digital Econ, I LAB, I-20122 Milan, Italy; Bocconi Univ, CESPRI, I-20122 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University; Bocconi University,"Ordanini, A (corresponding author), Bocconi Univ, Res Ctr Digital Econ, I LAB, Viale Filippetti 9, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",,,"Corrocher, Nicoletta/0000-0003-2642-8227; ORDANINI, ANDREA/0000-0002-7915-1359",,,,,35,127,147,11,144,ROUTLEDGE,HANTS,"CUSTOMER SERVICES DEPT, RANKINE RD, BASINGSTOKE, HANTS RG24 8PR, ENGLAND",0268-3962,,,J INFORM TECHNOL,J.

If the latter connects people to realize on-line business processes, the former could decide the trust problem by peer-to-peer networking and public-key cryptography. The purpose of this paper is to consider on distinct use cases at the all-pervasive impact of the blockchain technology and look at this as an inalienable part of our daily life.

Product innovation must link technological competence such as engineering and process know-how with knowledge about the customer, so that the product will meet the customers' needs, in order to secure market acceptance. Even though the importance of knowledge management in the technological innovation of a product has long been recognized, its potential for customer knowledge management has not been widely researched. To address the importance of the need of customer knowledge in innovative product development, this paper proposes an E-CKM model with a methodology for precisely delineating the process of customer knowledge management for innovative product development. In the knowledge management domain, an important task is the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, allowing information technology, such as web-based surveys and data mining to extract customer knowledge from different market segments. An empirical study applying the E-CKM model has been carried out, and it meets the evaluation criteria in a multiple-assessment scheme for showing a satisfactory result. The result is used in the decision making for innovative product development in order to reduce project risk and secure commercial success. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The Blockchain technology outweighs the challenges associated with the traditional transaction business governed and regulated by the third trusted party. There is a growth in the interest among the researchers, the industry, and the academia to study and leverage the potential of Blockchain. Blockchain provides a decentralized and distributed public ledger for all the participating parties. Though it seems that blockchain is a viable choice and solution for all the centralized governed and regulated transactions (in digital online space), it has potential challenges that need to be resolved; opportunities to be explored, and applications to be studied. This paper utilizes a systematic literature review to study several research endeavors made in the domain of blockchain. To further research on blockchain adoption, the paper theoretically constructs an integrated framework of the blockchain innovation adoption process in an organization considering organizational and user acceptance perspectives. This would facilitate its widespread adoption, thereby achieving sustained leadership solutions. The paper offers 23 propositions to information systems (IS)/information management (IM) scholars with respect to innovation characteristics, organizational characteristics, environmental characteristics, and user acceptance characteristics. Further, the paper explores several areas of future research and directions that can provide deep insights for overcoming challenges and for the adoption of blockchain technology.","[Upadhyay, Nitin] Goa Inst Management, Big Data Analyt & Informat Technol, Poriem 403005, Goa, India",Goa Institute of Management,"Upadhyay, N (corresponding author), Goa Inst Management, Big Data Analyt & Informat Technol, Poriem 403005, Goa, India.",upadhyay.nitin@gmail.com,,"Upadhyay, Nitin/0000-0001-8301-8924",,,,,204,111,118,18,164,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-4012,1873-4707,,INT J INFORM MANAGE,Int.

Their results, based on an analysis of 13,720 price quotes, show that when posted prices are considered, traditional retailers have the highest prices, followed by multichannel retailers, and pure-play e-tailers, in that order However when shipping costs are included, multichannel retailers have the highest prices, followed by pure-play e-tailers and traditional retailers, in that order With regard to price dispersion, pure-play e-tailers have the highest range of prices, but the lowest standard deviation. Multichannel retailers have the highest standard deviation in prices with or without shipping costs. These findings suggest that online markets offer opportunities for retailers to differentiate within and across the retailer types.","SDA Bocconi Grad Sch Management, Milan, Italy; Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Bocconi University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"SDA Bocconi Grad Sch Management, Milan, Italy.",fabio.ancarani@sdabocconi.it; vshankar@rhsmith.umd.edu,"SHANKAR, VENKATESH/JEP-7961-2023",,,,,,31,110,134,2,58,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0092-0703,1552-7824,,J ACAD MARKET SCI,J.

Given that ibusinesses such as social networking sites create value by providing a digital platform for users to interact with one another, we employ a user-network perspective and externalization logic, suggesting that ibusinesses' internationalization process depends critically on users' collective interactions, instead of being solely driven by firms' market commitments, as noted by the Uppsala model. However, ibusinesses may suffer from liabilities of outsidership due to the boundedness of international network effects. Drawing on social network theory, we demonstrate that such liabilities can be mitigated by first diffusing the ibusiness platform in countries with higher clout. Our analysis using a unique dataset of mobile ibusiness platforms finds empirical support for the hypotheses.

First generation or big 'C' creativity locates the creative enterprise as a complex set of behaviours and ideas exhibited by an individual, while second generation or small 'c' creativity locates the creative enterprise in the processes and products of collaborative and purposeful activity. Second generation creativity is gaining importance for a number of reasons: its acknowledged significance as a driver in the new or digital economy; recent clarification of the notion of 'creative capital'; the stated commitment of a growing number of universities to 'more creativity' as part of their declared vision for their staff and students; and, the recognition that the creative arts does not have a monopoly on creative capability. We argue that this shift allows more space for engaging with creativity as an outcome of pedagogical work in higher education. The article builds on the project of connecting 'creative capital' and university pedagogy that is already underway, assembling a number of principles from a wide range of scholarship, from computer modelling to social and cultural theorising. In doing so, it provides a framework for systematically orchestrating a 'creativity-enhancing' learning environment in higher education.","[McWilliam, Erica; Dawson, Shane] Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Educ, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"McWilliam, E (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Fac Educ, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia.",e.mcwilliam@qut.edu.au; sp.dawson@qut.edu.au,"Dawson, Shane/F-3946-2013","Dawson, Shane/0000-0003-2435-2193",,,,,49,106,139,0,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,,,HIGH EDUC,High.

Although seemingly simple, the human face can elicit multiple social perceptions due to the rich variations of its movements, morphology, and complexion. Consequently, identifying precisely what face information elicits different social perceptions is a complex empirical challenge that has largely remained beyond the reach of traditional methods. In the past decade, the emerging field of social psychophysics has developed new methods to address this challenge, with the potential to transfer psychophysical laws of social perception to the digital economy via avatars and social robots. At this exciting juncture, it is timely to review these new methodological developments. In this article, we introduce and review the foundational methodological developments of social psychophysics, present work done in the past decade that has advanced understanding of the face as a tool for social communication, and discuss the major challenges that lie ahead.","[Jack, Rachael E.] Univ Glasgow, Inst Neurosci & Psychol, Glasgow G12 8QB, Lanark, Scotland; [Jack, Rachael E.] Univ Glasgow, Sch Psychol, Glasgow G12 8QB, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow; University of Glasgow,"Jack, RE (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Inst Neurosci & Psychol, Glasgow G12 8QB, Lanark, Scotland.",rachael.jack@glasgow.ac.uk,"Schyns, Philippe/AAT-6989-2020","Schyns, Philippe/0000-0002-8542-7489","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K00607X/1, ES/K001973/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N019261/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/N019261/1] Funding Source: UKRI; ESRC [ES/K001973/1, ES/K00607X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,135,105,112,7,87,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",0066-4308,1545-2085,978-0-8243-0268-9,ANNU REV PSYCHOL,Annu.

To illustrate, the agency model utilized by the e-book publishing industry has recently received much negative attention brought by the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit against Apple, Inc. The emerging agency model in the e-book industry works as follows: the publisher sets the price of the digital goods and the retailers who serve as agents retain a percentage of the revenue associated with a consumer purchase. The regulators claim that the agency model is hurting this industry as well as the consumer's welfare because e-book prices have increased after the introduction of the agency model. We investigate the strategic impact of the agency model by examining a digital goods supply chain with one supplier and two competing retailers. In comparison to the benchmark wholesale model, we find that the agency model can coordinate the competing retailers by dividing the coordinated profits into a prenegotiated revenue sharing proportion. Further, we also identify the Pareto improving region whereby both the supplier and the retailers prefer the agency model to the wholesale model. Our main qualitative insight regarding the agency model still holds even when we consider the presence of the printed books in the marketplace. Thus, contrary to current press presaging the negative impact of the agency model on the e-books industry, we find the agency model to be superior to the traditional wholesale contracts for publishers, retailers and consumers in this digital goods industry.","[Tan, Yinliang] Tulane Univ, AB Freeman Sch Business, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Carrillo, Janice E.; Cheng, Hsing Kenny] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Tulane University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Carrillo, JE (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Dept Informat Syst & Operat Management, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",ytan2@tulane.edu; janice.carrillo@warrington.ufl.edu; hkcheng@ufl.edu,,"Carrillo, Janice/0000-0002-5905-6899",,,,,35,105,117,10,95,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0011-7315,1540-5915,,DECISION SCI,Decis.

Emoji, ubiquitous digital images that can appear in text messages, emails, and social media chat platforms, are rich in social, cultural, and economic significance. This article examines emoji as historical, social, and cultural objects, and as examples of skeuomorphism and of technical standardization. Now superseded as explicitly monetized objects by other graphics designed for affective interactions, emoji nonetheless represent emotional data of enormous interest to businesses in the digital economy, and continue to act symbolically as signifiers of affective meaning. We argue that emoji characters both embody and represent the tension between affect as human potential, and as a productive force that capital continually seeks to harness through the management of everyday biopolitics. Emoji are instances of a contest between the creative power of affective labor and its limits within a digital realm in the thrall of market logic.","[Stark, Luke] NYU, Dept Media Culture & Commun, 8th Floor,239 Greene St, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Crawford, Kate] Microsoft Res New York, New York, NY USA; [Crawford, Kate] MIT, Ctr Civ Media, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Crawford, Kate] NYU, Informat Law Inst, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); New York University,"Stark, L (corresponding author), NYU, Dept Media Culture & Commun, 8th Floor,239 Greene St, New York, NY 10003 USA.",luke.stark@nyu.edu,"黄, 荣 昌/HGA-6762-2022","Stark, Luke/0000-0002-2537-846X",,,,,64,104,131,16,95,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2056-3051,,,SOC MEDIA SOC,Soc.

This includes a discussion on whether both the market and organizations are all ready for the digital change and what are the opportunities that will enable firms to create and capture value though new business models. Design/methodology/approach Providing services is a proven and effective way to secure a competitive position, deliver long-term stable revenues and open up new market opportunities. However, it is also clear that some organisations are struggling to digitally transform. Therefore, the commentary provides a brief insight into how firms explore the possibilities of digital transformation and navigate these uncharted waters. Findings Today's digital technologies affect the organisation outside and in, enabling the creation of new business models and transforming the customer experience. The incumbents are acutely aware that they need to transform strategically - to build new networks and value chains. Originality/value This commentary extends earlier work exploring the digital disruption within services to highlight a number of connected areas: the challenges and opportunities of digital transformation at a strategic level, as well as understanding and enhancing the customer experience and seeing how new data-driven business models can underpin service transformation.","[Zaki, Mohamed] Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge,"Zaki, M (corresponding author), Univ Cambridge, Dept Engn, Cambridge, England.",mehyz2@cam.ac.uk,"Zaki, Mohamed/W-5494-2019","Zaki, Mohamed/0000-0003-0264-2691",,,,,22,103,113,30,297,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0887-6045,,,J SERV MARK,J.

To operate in an eBusiness environment, an organisation has to have a good command of knowledge on its markets, customers, products and services, methods and processes, competitors, employee skills and its regulatory environment. This is due to the fact that organisations can, with the advent of eBusiness, do business electronically, seamlessly across the globe, via the Internet and via intranets, which has caused an explosion of the richness and reach of information and knowledge. Knowledge management systems are now essential to ensure that value is extracted from knowledge internal and external to the organisation. eBusiness also broadens an organisation's customer base due to the possibility of operating globally through electronic means. Customer relationship management in the global and digital economy has, therefore, forced organisations to rethink the ways in which they build relationships with a broadened customer base. The researcher is of the opinion that customer relationships cannot take place without knowledge management. To enable organisations to become more efficient and effective in delivering products and/or services to customers, thus creating customer delight, knowledge on customers will have to be managed to ensure that the services organisations provide are those that will address customer needs. Knowledge management is, therefore, an integral part of customer relationship management and eBusiness. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In view of this problem, we conducted a study whose objective is to analyse the impact of ICT on economic growth. To address the study, we apply Partial Least Squares (PLS), using the databases of Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which allowed us to analyse those European Economic Community countries, members of the OECD, in order to reduce the differences in economic development between the countries analysed. As far as we know, this is the only work that studies the relationship between ICT and economic growth by measuring ICT with the Digital Economy and Society Index database (DESI), in European Union countries that belong to the OECD and that apply the PLS-SEM technique.

The integration of urban infrastructures with information and communication technologies enables the development of new operations models. Digitised infrastructures offer opportunities for public and private organisations to design and deliver more customer-centric products or services, particularly for those that require geographical proximity with consumers in the online to offline (O2O) context. A framework is developed and used to analyse three case examples. These cases illustrate the emergence of new operations models and, demonstrate how smart cities are redefining the characteristics of operations models around their scalability, analytical output and connectivity. We also explore the feasibility, vulnerability and acceptability of each new operation. This paper contributes to our understanding of how smart cities can potentially transform operational models, and sets out a research agenda for operations management in smart cities in the digital economy.","[Li, Feng; Nucciarelli, Alberto; Roden, Sinead] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England; [Graham, Gary] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",City University London; University of Leeds,"Li, F; Nucciarelli, A; Roden, S (corresponding author), City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1V 0HB, England.",Feng.Li.1@city.ac.uk; Alberto.Nucciarelli.1@city.ac.uk; Sinead.Roden.1@city.ac.uk,"Li, Feng/ABE-7849-2020","Roden, Sinead/0000-0002-9723-9231; Li, Feng/0000-0002-6589-6392; Nucciarelli, Alberto/0000-0002-2719-8286",Research Councils UK [EP/K039857/1]; EPSRC [EP/K039857/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K039857/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Research Councils UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Research Councils UK [grant number EP/K039857/1].,,82,97,108,19,229,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7287,1366-5871,,PROD PLAN CONTROL,Prod.

For women, in particular, the public nature of online communication is fraught with risk, opening the potential for ridicule, hate, and harassment. This research explores the vexed nature of visibility among Instagram content creators, a community that is especially beholden to this so-called visibility mandate. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 25 aspiring and professional Instagrammers, we show how they attempt to stave off potential critique in patterned ways. In their efforts to project themselves as authentic, many sought to deflect accusations of being too real, and, alternatively, as being not real enough. We argue that this uniquely gendered form of a socially mediated authenticity bind indexes the wider policing of women and other marginalized communities in digitally networked spaces, wherein they must carefully toe the line between visibility and vulnerability.","[Duffy, Brooke Erin] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Hund, Emily] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Cornell University; University of Pennsylvania,"Duffy, BE (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bduffy@cornell.edu; emily.hund@asc.upenn.edu,"黄, 荣 昌/HGA-6762-2022",,,,,,66,94,108,7,61,USC ANNENBERG PRESS,LOS ANGELES,"UNIV SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, KERCKHOFF HALL, 734 W ADAMS BLVD, MC7725, LOS ANGELES, CA 90089 USA",1932-8036,,,INT J COMMUN-US,Int.

Practicing managers and firms can adopt findings of the study, to follow the adoption of Industry 4.0 in digital supply chain economy.","[Gupta, Shivam] Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Modgil, Sachin] Int Management Inst, Dept Operat Management, Kolkata, India; [Gunasekaran, Angappa] Calif State Univ, Sch Business & Publ Adm, Bakersfield, CA USA; [Bag, Surajit] Univ Johannesburg, Postgrad Sch Engn Management, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Auckland Pk, Johannesburg, South Africa",Universite de Montpellier; Montpellier Business School; International Management Institute (IMI) Kolkata; California State University System; California State University Bakersfield; University of Johannesburg,"Gunasekaran, A (corresponding author), Calif State Univ Bakersfield, Sch Business & Publ Adm, 9001 Stockdale Highway,20BDC-140, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA.",agunasekaran@csub.edu,"Gupta, Shivam/R-2996-2016; Gupta, Shivam/JNE-3789-2023","Gupta, Shivam/0000-0002-2714-4958; BAG, SURAJIT/0000-0002-2344-9551; Modgil, Sachin/0000-0001-7816-6594",,,,,165,93,94,15,24,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1625-8312,1624-6039,,SUPPLY CHAIN FORUM,Supply Chain Forum,,2020,21,3,,,SI,,139,157,,10.1080/16258312.2020.1757369,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/16258312.2020.1757369,,,19,Management,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,VM4RM,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:001018934800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we develop and test an information-based theory of entrepreneurial activity within platform ecosystems. We postulate that ecosystems produce different types of informationa subset of which will foster entrepreneurship in the form of the commercialization of complementary products that were previously released for free. Our results indicate that product-specific information is associated with commercialization, but we fail to detect a relationship between market information and subsequent commercialization activity. Managerial SummaryThe digital economy has led to a proliferation of platform ecosystems that harness external innovation. These ecosystems rely on complementors who enhance the value of platforms by creating complementary technologies. Hence, complementors' commercial viability is important. One such type of ecosystem is an app store, which enables complementors to introduce software that improves the platform product. App stores exist for a variety of software platforms, ranging from mobile phone operating systems (iOS and Android) to electronic medical record systems (Epic and Cerner). In this research, we find that complementors who introduce a free version of a mobile app are more likely to commercialize their app in response to specific types of information and platform designers should manage information in their platforms to foster platform viability.","[Eckhardt, Jonathan T.; Carpenter, Mason] Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Grainger Hall,975 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Ciuchta, Michael P.] Univ Massachusetts, Manning Sch Business, Lowell, MA USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell,"Eckhardt, JT (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sch Business, Grainger Hall,975 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",jon.eckhardt@wisc.edu,,"Eckhardt, Jonathan/0000-0001-6980-8903",Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation; Richard M.

A rapidly growing number of organizations are conducting business and publishing business and financial reports online and in real-time. Real-time financial reporting is likely to necessitate continuous auditing to provide continuous assurance about the quality and credibility of the information presented. The audit process has, by necessity, evolved from a conventional manual audit to computer-based auditing and is now confronted with creating continuous electronic audits. Rapidly emerging information technology and demands for more timely communication of information to business stakeholders requires auditors to invent new ways to continuously monitor, gather, and analyze audit evidence. Continuous auditing is defined here as a comprehensive electronic audit process that enables auditors to provide some degree of assurance on continuous information simultaneously with, or shortly after, the disclosure of the information. This paper is based on a review of related literature, innovative continuous auditing applications, and the experiences of the authors. An approach for building continuous audit capacity is presented and audit data warehouses and data marts are described. Ever improving technology suggests that the real-time exchange of sensitive financial data will place constant pressure on auditors to update audit techniques. Most of the new techniques that will be required will involve creation of new software and audit models. Future research should focus on how continuous auditing could be constantly improved in various auditing domains including assurance, attestation, and audit services.","Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; Univ Mississippi, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Memphis; University of Mississippi,"Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",,,,,,,,28,93,123,9,78,AMER ACCOUNTING ASSOC,SARASOTA,"5717 BESSIE DR, SARASOTA, FL 34233 USA",0278-0380,1558-7991,,AUDITING-J PRACT TH,Audit.-J.

Will such rapid expansion bring desirable outcome to firms? In a context of international new ventures (INVs) from emerging markets, we reconceptualize export expansion speed as the pace of exporting across institutional distance over a certain period of time. We then examine the relationship between rapid export expansion across institutional distance and overall firm performance. We incorporate directionality into export expansion and hypothesize the relationship to be positive when INVs export upwardly to more open countries, yet the relationship to be negative when INVs export downwardly to less open countries. We also hypothesize that the degree of market liberalization in subnational regions of origin of the INVs moderates the above speed-performance relationships. Instrumental variable models based on data of Chinese indigenous INVs during 2000-2009 support these hypotheses. This study both zooms in and zooms out the analytical lens along the location-related institutional axis, examines the joint effect of institutions involved in supranational directions and subnational origins on firm performance, and advances institutional theory.","[Deng, Ziliang] Renmin Univ China, Renmin Business Sch, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Jean, Ruey-Jer Bryan] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan; [Sinkovics, Rudolf R.] Univ Manchester, Alliance Manchester Business Sch, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Sinkovics, Rudolf R.] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Lappeenranta, Finland; [Sinkovics, Rudolf R.] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Renmin University of China; National Chengchi University; University of Manchester; Alliance Manchester Business School; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Deng, ZL (corresponding author), Renmin Univ China, Renmin Business Sch, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",ziliang.deng@ruc.edu.cn,"Sinkovics, Rudolf R./F-4092-2010","Sinkovics, Rudolf R./0000-0002-4471-5054; Deng, Ziliang/0000-0002-4767-2803","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71202149, 71772175]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors are grateful to the comments received from the editors John Cantwell, Shige Makino, Ram Mudambi, Gongming Qian, anonymous reviewers, Jean Boddewyn, Michael Carney, Katrin Muehlfeld, Gracy J.

Situated between the presumed freedom of the digital economy and the feelings of risk that accompany independently contracted work under neoliberalism, these drivers evidence what we term splintering precarity-a bifurcated set of risks that stands in contrast to both certain more privileged dotcom employees who may not require a supplemental income and less privileged laborers who are denied even the on-demand employment of Uber and Lyft. The experience of these drivers offers an important picture of the affective impacts of the infrastructural outsourcing that characterizes much early 21st-century economics.","[Malin, Brenton J.; Chandler, Curry] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Commun, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Malin, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Commun, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",bmalin@pitt.edu,,"Malin, Brenton/0000-0003-3610-3768",,,,,42,90,109,1,72,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1753-9129,1753-9137,,COMMUN CULT CRIT,Commun.

We offer an examination of streamers broadcasting as a character, which we situate within the context of play becoming work, the labor of performance and acting, and the economic compulsions that shape cultural labor on Twitch. We draw on hundred interviews with professional and aspiring-professional game broadcasters conducted in 2016 and 2017 at gaming events across the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Poland, alongside ethnographic research.

Rather, e-commerce is a paradigm shift. It is a disruptive innovation that is radically changing the traditional way of doing business. The industry is moving so fast because it operates under totally different principles and work rules in the digital economy. A general rule in e-commerce is that there is no simple prescription and almost no such thing as an established business or revenue model for companies even within the same industry. Under such conditions, an analytical framework is needed to assist e-commerce planners and strategic managers in assessing the critical success factors when formulating e-commerce business models and strategies. This research develops an analytical framework based on the theories of transaction costs and switching cost. Both demand-side and supply-side economies of scale and scope are also applied to the development of this framework. In addition, e-commerce revenue models and strategies are also discussed. Based on the analytical framework developed by this research, this paper discusses the five essential steps for e-commerce success. They are: redefine the competitive advantage; rethink business strategy; re-examine traditional business and revenue models, re-engineer the corporation and Web site; and re-Invent customer service. E-commerce planners and strategic managers will be able to use the framework to analyze and evaluate the critical successful factors for e-commerce success.","Pacific Lutheran Univ, Elect Commerce Resource Ctr, Tacoma, WA 98447 USA; Pacific Lutheran Univ, Sch Business, Tacoma, WA 98447 USA",Pacific Lutheran University; Pacific Lutheran University,"Pacific Lutheran Univ, Elect Commerce Resource Ctr, Tacoma, WA 98447 USA.",,,,,,,,23,86,107,1,100,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1066-2243,,,INTERNET RES,Internet Res.,,2001,11,4,,,,,349,359,,10.1108/10662240110402803,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/10662240110402803,,,11,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Telecommunications,476ZX,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000171259600010,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a centralized BPM, many indicators, such as security and openness, or cost and flexibility, are conflicting with each other. For example, inviting new partners across enterprises, domains, and regions to form a service workflow exposes new risks and needs additional security mechanisms for scrutiny; enhancing the flexibility of business workflow compositions increases the cost of security assurance. Blockchain technology (BCT) has thrown the light on the development of vital solutions to various BPM problems. BCT has to be integrated with other BPM system components that often involve IoT devices to implement specified functionalities related to the application.

It challenges the validity and effectiveness of traditional linear processes for digital transformation that first develop a new strategy, business model or organizational design enabled by digital technologies and then execute it according to the plan. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on current research with a group of global digital champions at the forefront of digital transformation, including Amazon, Alibaba, Baidu, Google, JD.com, Uber, VMWare and Slack. Findings The research finds that at least three new approaches are emerging in leading organizations, which are (1) innovating by experimenting, (2) radical transformation via successive incremental changes and (3) dynamic sustainable advantages through an evolving portfolio of temporary advantages. Research limitations/implications More research is needed to systematically investigate such emerging approaches and develop new theories and new analytical frameworks. Practical implications These emerging approaches can be used to guide digital transformation initiatives. Social implications They also enable business leaders to tackle grand societal challenges using financially sustainable and scalable operational models, generating profit and impact at the same time. Originality/value It challenges traditional linear approaches for leading digital transformation and highlights the need for new and iterative approaches for bridging the strategy-execution gap in the volatile digital economy.","[Li, Feng] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London, England",City University London,"Li, F (corresponding author), City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London, England.",Feng.Li.1@city.ac.uk,"Li, Feng/ABE-7849-2020","Li, Feng/0000-0002-6589-6392",,,,,20,80,84,27,338,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-3577,1758-6593,,INT J OPER PROD MAN,Int.

Increasingly, policymakers within various national governments and international organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are examining the original sustainability policy concepts applied within the Brundtland Report of 1987 through the lens of digitalization. While the growth of a digital economy may increase productivity and benefit local and global economies, digitalization also raises potential sustainability challenges pertaining to social (i.e., the benefits or costs imposed by disruptive digital technologies upon social networks and ways of life, including threats to economic sustainability and the rise of economic disparity) and environmental wellbeing (i.e., natural resource stewardship and concern for future generations) driven by the automation of information processing and delivery of services. Various perspectives have been raised regarding how the process of digitalization might be governed, and national governments remain at odds regarding a single best strategy to promote sustainable digitalization using the Brundtland concept to meet the development needs of the present without compromising the needs of future generations (i.e., social and environmental well-being). This paper reviews three governance strategies that countries can use in conjunction with adaptive governance to respond to digitalization sustainability threats: (i) a laissez-faire, industry-driven approach; (ii) a precautionary and preemptive strategy on the part of government; and (iii) a stewardship and active surveillance approach by government agencies that reduce the risks derived from digitalization while promoting private sector innovation. Regardless of a state's digital governance response and how it is shaped by political and institutional realities, adaptive governance approaches are likely necessary to address the economic and social sustainability challenges posed within differing manifestations of digitalization.","[Linkov, Igor; Trump, Benjamin D.; Poinsatte-Jones, Kelsey] US Army, Engn Res & Dev Ctr, 696 Virginia Rd, Concord, MA 01742 USA; [Florin, Marie-Valentine] IRGC, Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland",United States Department of Defense; United States Army; U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; U.S. Army Engineer Research & Development Center (ERDC); ERDC - Risk Modeling; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Linkov, I (corresponding author), US Army, Engn Res & Dev Ctr, 696 Virginia Rd, Concord, MA 01742 USA.",igor.linkov@usace.army.mil; Benjamin.D.Trump@usace.army.mil; Kelsey.M.Poinsatte-Jones@usace.army.mil; marie-valentine.florin@epfl.ch,"Linkov, Igor/AAH-5981-2019","Linkov, Igor/0000-0002-0823-8107",US Army Military Program,US Army Military Program,The authors would like to thank George Shephard for his image assistance.

A key mechanism that explains the policy impact of the GVC approach are the networks created between the policy entrepreneurs inside the international organizations (IOs) dealing with economic development and the idea entrepreneurs in the research community. The policy engagement of various segments of the GVC research community with development-oriented IOs has increased the scope and visibility of the GVC literature, and improved the quality and relevance of the findings from selected GVC research programs. However, one of the drawbacks of this collaboration has been the multiple meanings attached to the GVC concept and its policy usages within the IOs and national policy communities. The GVC framework remains centrally involved in contemporary research frontiers, including the impact of tariffs on national competitiveness and innovation systems, the digital economy, the future of manufacturing, the co-evolution between local economic clusters and global production networks, and the role of foreign direct investment in establishing complete value chains as a catch-up strategy in developing economies.","[Gereffi, Gary] Duke Univ, Dept Sociol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Gereffi, G (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Sociol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",ggere@soc.duke.edu,"N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023",,,,,,84,78,83,7,33,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2522-0691,2522-0705,,J INT BUS POLICY,J.

In this context, comparative research on development of the digital economy, both at national and regional level, should be considered as an actual and important scientific task. Therefore, the main aim of the article is to assess and compare the development level of digital economy in Visegrad countries at regional level (NUTS 1). In the research, the digital economy is defined as a multiple-criteria phenomenon. As a result, in the empirical research, the TOPSIS method with application of generalized distance measure GDM was used. The data for diagnostic variables concerning digital infrastructure in the years 2012 and 2015 was provided by Eurostat. On the one hand, the analysis confirmed a relatively quick progress in building digital economy at regional level in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. On the other hand, significant disparities between the analyzed regions can be seen, especially in case of Polish regions.","[Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Balcerzak, AP (corresponding author), Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",adam.balcerzak@umk.pl; michal.pietrzak@umk.pl,"Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014; Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016","Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478; Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373",,,,,39,77,79,17,185,"UNIV TOMASE BATI & ZLINE, FAK MANAGEMENTU EKONOMIKY",ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",1804-171X,1804-1728,,J COMPETITIVENESS,J.

Customer relationship management (CRM) is an information-technology-enabling management tool, which manages the relationship with customers to understand, target, and attract them, with the objective of satisfying and retaining customers. Their synergy potential draws attention in the academic community and has led to the emergence of the customer knowledge management (CKM) model. In a knowledge management domain, an important task is the conversion of tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge, whereby the well-established Kano's Method has come up to demand and extract customer knowledge for attractive quality creation in new product development projects. As a consequence, this study proposes a Kano-CKM model with a methodology to delineate precisely the process of customer knowledge discovery for innovative product development.

We develop and empirically test a novel conceptualization of conversational robo advisors building on prior work in human-to-human communication and interpersonal psychology, showing that conversational robo advisors cause greater levels of affective trust compared to non-conversational robo advisors and evoke a more benevolent evaluation of a financial services firm. We demonstrate that this increase in affective trust not only affects firm perception (in terms of benevolence attributions or a more positively-valenced onboarding experience), but has important implications for investor behavior, such as greater recommendation acceptance and an increase in asset allocation toward conversational robo advisors. These findings have important implications for research on trust formation between humans and machines, the effective design of conversational robo advisors, and public policy in the digital economy.","[Hildebrand, Christian; Bergner, Anouk] Univ St Gallen, TechX Lab HSG, Inst Mkt, Dufourstr 40a, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Hildebrand, C (corresponding author), Univ St Gallen, TechX Lab HSG, Inst Mkt, Dufourstr 40a, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland.",christian.hildebrand@unisg.ch; anouk.bergner@unisg.ch,"Hildebrand, Christian/JFJ-8761-2023","Bergner, Anouk/0000-0003-1060-9672",University of St.Gallen,University of St.Gallen,Open access funding provided by University of St.Gallen,,74,76,79,28,145,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0092-0703,1552-7824,,J ACAD MARKET SCI,J.

By taking a demand-side perspective, I argue that business models create and capture value when the elements that compose a business model improve how consumers perceive a firm's products and better enable heterogeneous consumers to act on their willingness-to-pay. I develop theory on how the freemium business model competes with the premium business model and test hypotheses in the market for digital PC games. Results show that freemium games are played less and generate less revenues and that greater variety in games' menus of paid items is associated with higher revenues. Managerial Summary: Freemium business models are increasingly prevalent in the digital economy, yet very little is known about how freemium affects consumers' perceptions of value and their willingness-to-pay. In this article, I study how the freemium business model competes with the premium business model in the market for digital PC games. Results show that freemium games are played less and generate less revenues than premium games and that greater variety in games' menus of paid items is associated with higher revenues. This implies that in order to achieve competitive parity with firms operating the premium business model, firms operating the freemium business model need to create more value (e.g., through improved product quality, income from advertisements, or unlocking network externalities) or operate at lower costs.","[Rietveld, Joost] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Strateg Management & Entrepreneurship, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Rietveld, J (corresponding author), Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50,Mandeville T Bldg, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands.",rietveld@rsm.nl,,"Rietveld, Joost/0000-0001-8722-4442",,,,,77,71,79,16,221,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1932-4391,1932-443X,,STRATEG ENTREP J,Strateg.

With many heralding a data revolution', the opportunities and enthusiasm for using social media and SMS data in crisis response are on the rise. The article constructs an analytical framework in order to scrutinise the three main claims made on behalf of technologically advanced humanitarian information systems: that they can access data more accurately, more quickly, and alter power relations in emancipatory ways. It does so in relation to two aspects of digital humanitarianism: visual technology and crisis mapping, and big data. The article is partly informed by a historical perspective, but also by interview and other material that suggests some of the claims made on behalf of technology are exaggerated. In particular, we argue that the enthusiasm for the data is vastly outstripped by the capacity to meaningfully analyse it.

This includes technological innovation in the digital space which has brought about theoretical changes in the way marketing is applied, more so in the B2B environment where communication is essential in the alignment with various stakeholders. Several discussions on ethical leadership in the digital economy have provided some insights into addressing increased complexity in a society where markets are connected (physically) yet disconnected (proximity) and this has led marketing practices going astray. Our paper proposes the relevance of ethical leadership and its role in the application of technological innovation by arguing that technological innovation has a positive impact on firm performance and that ethical leadership plays a critical role in moderating this effect. We use a dynamic panel data system Generalized Method of Moment (GMM) approach to examine secondary data from 465 IT service companies and demonstrate that ethical leadership plays a critical role as it enables innovation through technology, and this has an impact on the firm's performance.","[Lin, Woon Leong; Ho, Jo Ann] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia; [Yip, Nick] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Sambasivan, Murali] Taylors Business Sch, Subang Jaya, Malaysia; [Sambasivan, Murali] Thiagarajar Sch Management, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India",Universiti Putra Malaysia; University of East Anglia,"Ho, JA (corresponding author), Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang, Malaysia.",linwoonleong@gmail.com; N.Yip@uea.ac.uk; ann_hj@upm.edu.my; director@tsm.ac.in,"Sambasivan, Murali/AAD-6485-2022; Leong, Lin Woon/K-3913-2019; woon leong, lin/GQA-7521-2022; Sambasivan, Murali/F-7622-2013","Leong, Lin Woon/0000-0002-6568-412X; woon leong, lin/0000-0002-6568-412X; Ho, Jo Ann/0000-0002-7031-7068; Sambasivan, Murali/0000-0002-5779-4126",,,,,112,68,70,13,124,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0019-8501,1873-2062,,IND MARKET MANAG,Ind.

Further advancement of digital innovation, including cloud, mobile services, and artificial intelligence, has augmented this change significantly and provided us with extraordinary services and welfare never anticipated before. However, contrary to such an accomplishment, productivity in industrialized countries now confronts an apparent decline raising the question of a possible productivity paradox in the digital economy. The limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) statistics in measuring the advancement of the digital economy have become an important subject. While this mismatch is an old problem rooted in the dynamics of product innovations, since mismatch brought about by information and communication technology (ICT) is very strong, finding a solution to this critical issue has become highly crucial in the digital economy. Based on an intensive review of preceding studies and empirical analyses of national, industrial and individual behaviors in the digital economy, this paper attempted to draw a perspective on this critical issue. By means of an analysis of co-evolution among a shift in people's preferences from economic functionality to supra-functionality beyond economic value, the advancement of ICT and paradigm change to uncaptured GDP, a solution to this critical issue was investigated. New insights for measuring the digital economy were explored which provide insight into integration of national accounts with product-oriented micro-analysis efforts.","[Watanabe, Chihiro; Naveed, Kashif; Neittaanmaki, Pekka] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Watanabe, Chihiro] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria; [Tou, Yuji] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan",University of Jyvaskyla; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Watanabe, C (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",watanabe.c.pqr@gmail.com,,,Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [293446],Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland,"The research leading to these results is the part of a project: Platform Value Now: Value capturing in the fast emerging platform ecosystems, supported by the Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [grant number 293446].",,97,68,74,23,281,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0040-1625,1873-5509,,TECHNOL FORECAST SOC,Technol.

This paper discusses the rationale for these fears, highlighting the specific nature of AI and comparing previous waves of automation and robotization with the current advancements made possible by a widespread adoption of AI. It argues that large opportunities in terms of increases in productivity can ensue, including for developing countries, given the vastly reduced costs of capital that some applications have demonstrated and the potential for productivity increases, especially among the low skilled. At the same time, risks in the form of further increases in inequality need to be addressed if the benefits from AI-based technological progress are to be broadly shared. For this, skills policies are necessary but not sufficient. In addition, new forms of regulating the digital economy are called for that prevent further rises in market concentration, ensure proper data protection and privacy, and help share the benefits of productivity growth through the combination of profit sharing, (digital) capital taxation, and a reduction in working time. The paper calls for a moderately optimistic outlook on the opportunities and risks from AI, provided that policymakers and social partners take the particular characteristics of these new technologies into account.","[Ernst, Ekkehardt; Merola, Rossana; Samaan, Daniel] Int Labor Org, Res Dept, Route Morillons 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Ernst, E (corresponding author), Int Labor Org, Res Dept, Route Morillons 4, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",ernste@ilo.org; merola@ilo.org; samaan@ilo.org,"Ernst, Ekkehard/HKO-1953-2023; Klitzke, Karina/IXD-3488-2023","Ernst, Ekkehard/0000-0001-6822-9766;",,,,,97,65,74,19,84,SCIENDO,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",2193-9004,,,IZA J LABOR POLICY,IZA J.

Changes in medicine are part of the complex digital economy based on creating value from analysis of behavioral data acquired by the tracking of daily digital activities. Without an understanding of the digital economy, recommending the use of technology to patients with mental illness can inadvertently lead to harm. Behavioral data are sold in the secondary data market, combined with other data from many sources, and used in algorithms that automatically classify people. These classifications are used in commerce and government, may be discriminatory, and result in non-medical harm to patients with mental illness. There is also potential for medical harm related to poor quality online information, self-diagnosis and self-treatment, passive monitoring, and the use of unvalidated smartphone apps. The goal of this paper is to increase awareness and foster discussion of the new ethical issues. To maximize the potential of technology to help patients with mental illness, physicians need education about the digital economy, and patients need help understanding the appropriate use and limitations of online websites and smartphone apps.","[Bauer, Michael; Bauer, Rita] Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Klinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany; [Glenn, Tasha] ChronoRecord Assoc Inc, Fullerton, CA 92834 USA; [Monteith, Scott] Michigan State Univ, Coll Human Med, Traverse City Campus,1400 Med Campus Dr, Traverse City, MI 49684 USA; [Whybrow, Peter C.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Semel Inst Neurosci & Human Behav, Dept Psychiat & Biobehav Sci, 300 UCLA Med Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Geddes, John] Univ Oxford, Warneford Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Oxford OX3 7JX, England",Technische Universitat Dresden; Carl Gustav Carus University Hospital; Michigan State University; Michigan State University College of Human Medicine; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Oxford,"Bauer, M (corresponding author), Tech Univ Dresden, Univ Klinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Dept Psychiat & Psychotherapy, Fetscherstr 74, D-01307 Dresden, Germany.",michael.bauer@uniklinikum-dresden.de,,"Geddes, John/0000-0002-5281-5960",,,,,239,65,69,6,56,SPRINGEROPEN,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2194-7511,,,INT J BIPOLAR DISORD,INT.

The review has found that the currently dominant approach is either a micro-level case study approach or a macro-level statistical approach. It is concluded that a more predictive and empirical model, which can be applied within a sector of society, should be more beneficial in the long term. This approach should help simulate potential impacts resulting from changes of indicators, so that positive effects can be promoted and negative ones alleviated proactively, rather than knowing and accepting outcomes passively.

The author proceeds by reviewing how Marx applies the concepts of alienation and exploitation to his paradigmatic example (i.e., the factory); the author then attempts to extend the logic of both concepts to determine what they might reveal about the structural conditions of social media. A difference of prime importance between the two case studies is that factory work is wage labor coerced by economic necessity, whereas use of social networking sites is apparently voluntary and done freely. The author concludes by arguing that social media users are subject to levels of exploitation relatively consistent with industrial capitalism, whereas the structural conditions of the digital economy link profitability to a reduction in the intensity of alienation. Finally, he infers that social media is not economically beneficial to most users.","Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Rey, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, 2112 Art Sociol Bldg, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",pjrey.socy@gmail.com,,,,,,,50,62,77,6,111,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7642,1552-3381,,AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

Whilst such changes can offer remote workers greater temporal and locational flexibilities, there is growing concern that their work is being insidiously commodified in line with Labour Process Theory to enhance the position of firms in Global Value Chains (GVCs). Integrating insights from these frameworks and relevant fields of scholarship, we examine how the nature and location of remote work and its HRM are being recontextualised. Our systematic analysis of peer-reviewed published empirical findings demonstrates the need to broaden the existing firm-centric focus of the GVC literature to encompass workers and their HRM, particularly as there are increasing numbers of workers operating outside firms using digital technology. It also reveals that the digitisation of the labour process is generating a spectrum of nuanced and unfolding implications for remote workers and their HRM, and a complexity of spatial reconfigurations, which provoke debate and agendas for future research and HRM practice.","[Donnelly, Rory] Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Work Org & Management Dept, Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZH, Merseyside, England; [Johns, Jennifer] Univ Bristol, Dept Management, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Liverpool; University of Bristol,"Donnelly, R (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Sch Management, Work Org & Management Dept, Chatham St, Liverpool L69 7ZH, Merseyside, England.",Rory.Donnelly@liverpool.ac.uk,"N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023",,,,,,99,61,66,16,203,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0958-5192,1466-4399,,INT J HUM RESOUR MAN,Int.

Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model and Fountain's technology enactment theory, a multidimensional research model was developed. The model was tested empirically through an international study of 67 countries using reputable archival data, primarily including the UN's e-government survey and the Economist Intelligence Unit's digital economy rankings. Findings - The empirical findings indicate a strong positive reciprocal (two-way) relationship between e-government development and the digital economy. This finding provides empirical evidence to support the general notion of co-evolution between technology and organisations. The study also finds that along with social, economic, political, technological and demographic factors, certain national cultural characteristics have significant effects on the digital economy and e-government development. Research limitations/implications - Relying on archival global data sets, this study is constrained by the coverage and formulation of the data set indices, the sample size (67 countries), and the impossibility of detecting errors that may occur in the process of data collection. Therefore, caution should be taken when making generalisations about the findings of this study. Originality/value - The paper addresses a deficit of empirical research that is supported by sound and established theories to explain short-term dynamics and the long-term impact of the digital economy on public administration. The study contributes to a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the dynamic relationship between e-government development and the digital economy.","[Zhao, Fang] Univ S Pacific, Suva, Fiji; [Zhao, Fang] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Wallis, Joseph] Amer Univ Sharjah, SBM, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Singh, Mohini] RMIT Univ, Business Informat Technol Dept, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia",University of the South Pacific; American University of Sharjah; American University of Sharjah; Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Zhao, F (corresponding author), Univ S Pacific, Suva, Fiji.",f.zhao@ecu.edu.au,,"Zhao, Fang/0000-0003-3718-6999; Wallis, Joseph/0000-0002-6584-3426",,,,,97,61,64,21,189,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1066-2243,,,INTERNET RES,Internet Res.,,2015,25,5,,,,,734,766,,10.1108/IntR-02-2014-0055,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IntR-02-2014-0055,,,33,"Business; Computer Science, Information Systems; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Telecommunications,DD1RQ,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000369699600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of the paper is to verify a hypothesis that a higher level of national digitalization provides positive trends in reducing the risks of poverty and social exclusion for the population. The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) was used to evaluate the digitalization levels of the EU countries. The indicator People at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) was applied to estimate the poverty level. As the main research methods, the authors used a comparative and correlation analysis with respect to the above-mentioned indicators, as well as the Monte Carlo method in order to evaluate the probability of a change in the indicator population at risk of poverty or social exclusion in 2021. The EU countries with higher digitalization levels have a lower percentage of the population at risk of poverty and social exclusion. However, a higher digitalization level of the EU member states does not provide an accelerated risk reduction of poverty and social exclusion. Statistical calculations with respect to the entire population of these countries mainly indicate reverse processes. At the same time, a further reduction of poverty and social exclusion level is less probable in the countries with a higher level of digitalization. For relatively poor segments of the population (the 1st and 2nd quintiles by income) in the EU member states, the level of digitalization does not play a significant role. For relatively wealthy segments of the population (the 3rd and 4th quintiles by income) the authors noticed a pattern: the higher the level of digitalization is, the lower the risk of poverty and social exclusion becomes. A pairwise comparison of countries with initially similar AROPE values showed that in most cases (3 out of 5), the countries with higher levels of digitalization showed a more significant reduction in poverty and social exclusion. However, the probability of further positive changes in this area is higher for the countries with a lower level of digitalization.","[Kwilinski, Aleksy; Dzwigol, Henryk] London Acad Sci & Business, 3rd Floor,120 Baker St, London W1U 6TU, England; [Kwilinski, Aleksy; Dzwigol, Henryk] Sumy State Univ, Mkt Dept, 2 Rymskogo St, UA-40007 Sumy, Ukraine; [Vyshnevskyi, Oleksandr] NAS Ukraine, Inst Ind Econ, 2 Maria Kapnist St, UA-03057 Kiev, Ukraine; [Dzwigol, Henryk] Silesian Tech Univ, Fac Org & Management, 26-28 Roosevelt St, PL-41800 Zabrze, Poland",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University; National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Institute of Industrial Economics of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine; Silesian University of Technology,"Kwilinski, A (corresponding author), London Acad Sci & Business, 3rd Floor,120 Baker St, London W1U 6TU, England.;Kwilinski, A (corresponding author), Sumy State Univ, Mkt Dept, 2 Rymskogo St, UA-40007 Sumy, Ukraine.",allexxandr@gmail.com; a.kwilinski@london-asb.co.uk; henryk.dzwigol@poczta.fm,"Oleksandr, Vyshnevskyi/ABG-6406-2020; Dźwigoł, Henryk/N-5498-2019; Kwilinski, Aleksy/B-7526-2017","Oleksandr, Vyshnevskyi/0000-0002-2375-6033; Dźwigoł, Henryk/0000-0002-2005-0078; Kwilinski, Aleksy/0000-0001-6318-4001",,,,,46,59,59,6,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1911-8066,1911-8074,,J RISK FINANC MANAG,J.

In both 2016 and 2017, the leading live streaming platform Twitch.tv broadcast over 500,000 years of video, which were produced by over two million regular broadcasters (streamers'), and consumed by an audience of several hundred million viewers. Streamers can profit, up to and including a full-time living wage' for those at the highest levels. Numerous successful streamers with chronic health issues have discussed the personal and professional benefits streaming brings them. Utilising data from a research project with 100 interviews, alongside approximately 500 hours of ethnographic observation, this paper examines the experiences of live streaming for broadcasters with disabilities, mental health issues, or physical health issues. Firstly, I explore the positive elements of streaming for these broadcasters, focusing on the many conditions represented in this demographic, and the benefits streaming gives for inclusion and community. Secondly, I consider the negative experiences of these streamers, focused on entanglements of health and technology that make their streaming lives potentially more challenging than their colleagues. Thirdly, I focus on the economic opportunities, and the potential for entrepreneurial activity, the platform affords. I conclude the analysis by exploring how these aspects make live streaming a potentially exemplary emancipatory and entrepreneurial space for these individuals, but not one without challenges.","[Johnson, Mark R.] Univ Alberta, Dept Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada",University of Alberta,"Johnson, MR (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Polit Sci, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",markrjohnsongames@gmail.com,"黄, 荣 昌/HGA-6762-2022; Dubisetty, Mallikarjuna Rao/JWO-4481-2024","Johnson, Mark R/0000-0003-4622-650X",,,,,45,59,65,17,126,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

With the newly enacted Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare due for implementation by 2013, it is inevitable that a centralised European health record system will become a reality even before 2020.

The privacy threat posed by a supranational network is a key concern. Cross-border and Interoperable electronic health record systems make confidential data more easily and rapidly accessible to a wider audience and increase the risk that personal data concerning health could be accidentally exposed or easily distributed to unauthorised parties by enabling greater access to a compilation of the personal data concerning health, from different sources, and throughout a lifetime.

This is considered as a positive development for its high flexibility in hours and place of work, and also for providing employment opportunities to workers in developing countries, individuals with disabilities or those with care responsibilities. This article examines the on-going trend in outsourcing low-skilled work to the crowd through online platforms, and how platform design features and algorithmic management are used by digital labour platforms to assign, monitor and evaluate work. The paper argues that these distinctive features of digital platforms have an impact on working conditions in terms of access to tasks, remuneration and working time flexibility. The paper draws on a global survey of 675 workers on five globally operating platforms in 27 developing countries. Its findings highlight the need for transparency in platform architecture, design and algorithms to ensure that workers are protected from the vulnerabilities they face with digital work.","[Rani, Uma; Furrer, Marianne] ILO, 4 Route Morillons, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Rani, U (corresponding author), ILO, 4 Route Morillons, CH-1211 Geneva, Switzerland.",amara@ilo.org,"Rani, Uma/X-1714-2019; N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023",,,,,,72,58,62,30,231,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

This paper presents a bottom-up model to estimate data center electricity demand in the United States over a 20 year period and examines observed and projected electricity use trends in the context of changing data center operations. Results indicate a rapidly increasing electricity demand at the turn of the century that has significantly subsided to a nearly steady annual electricity use of about 70 billionkWh in recent years. While data center workloads continue to grow exponentially, comparable increases in electricity demand have been avoided through the adoption of key energy efficiency measures and a shift towards large cloud-based service providers. Alternative projections from the model illustrate the wide range in potential electricity that could be consumed to support data centers, with the US data center workload demand estimated for 2020 requiring a total electricity use that varies by about 135 billion kWh, depending on the adoption rate of efficiency measures during this decade. While recent improvements in data center energy efficiency have been a success, the growth of data center electricity use beyond 2020 is uncertain, as modeled trends indicate that the efficiency measures of the past may not be enough for the data center workloads of the future. The results show that successful stabilization of data center electricity will require new innovations in data center efficiency to further decouple electricity demand from the ever-growing demand for data center services.","[Shehabi, Arman; Smith, Sarah J.] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Masanet, Eric] Northwestern Univ, McCormick Sch Engn, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Koomey, Jonathan] Koomey Analyt, POB 1545, Burlingame, CA 94011 USA",United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Northwestern University,"Shehabi, A (corresponding author), Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, Energy Anal & Environm Impacts Div, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",ashehabi@lbl.gov,"Masanet, Eric/I-5649-2012; Koomey, Jonathan/AAR-6685-2021; Shehabi, Arman/AAY-4097-2021","Koomey, Jonathan/0000-0002-2983-344X; Shehabi, Arman/0000-0002-1735-6973",Department of Energy Advanced Manufacturing Office; Office of Science of the United States Department of Energy [DE-AC02-05CH11231],Department of Energy Advanced Manufacturing Office; Office of Science of the United States Department of Energy(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),This material is based upon work conducted by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with support from the Department of Energy Advanced Manufacturing Office.

Automation to reduce menial or repetitive jobs, digitization of work to render remaining workers more efficient and AI to provide more reliable and productive top-end professional work are all inter-related initiatives enacted by current dominant imaginaries of efficiency and maximization. We argue that there is an Ellulian phenomenon of efficient techniques spreading within technical logics that go beyond neo-liberal frontiers namely, algorithmic approaches which attempt to capture and reduce all manners of human knowledge and meaning across the efficient explication, formalization and manipulation of signs. Such purely 'efficient' and analytical approaches fail to recognize the unique and inimitable characteristics of human creativity and its associated tacit knowledge. Inspirations from more holistic interpretations of Jungian symbolism allow us to provide a starting point towards comprehending the complex, ambiguous, constantly emerging and essentially hard-to-define aspects of human creativity and tacit knowledge. This, along with the argument that there exists a relationship between the democratization of knowledge and democratic decisional processes, provides the basis to present an alternative imaginary of efficiency as proposed by Feenberg (1999). Such an imaginary, allows for the democratic participation of humans in the decisional process and development of technology; and also recognizes and enacts humans as full legitimate partners with technology in their mutual shaping capacities thus, leading to human-centric organizations.","[Holford, W.

Policymakers invest considerable resources in attracting and developing innovative, high-tech industries, but there is relatively little evidence on the distribution of the benefits. This paper investigates the labour market impact of high-tech growth on low and mid-skilled workers, using data on UK local labour markets from 2009-2015. It shows that high-tech industries - either STEM-intensive 'high-tech' or digital economy - have a positive jobs multiplier, with each 10 new high-tech jobs creating around 7 local non-tradeable service jobs, around 6 of which go to low-skilled workers. Employment rates for mid-skilled workers do not increase, but they benefit from higher wages. Yet while low-skilled workers gain from higher employment rates, the jobs are often poorly paid service work, so average wages fall, particularly when increased housing costs are considered.","[Lee, Neil] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Clarke, Stephen] Resolut Fdn, London SW1H 9AA, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Lee, N (corresponding author), London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",n.d.lee@lse.ac.uk,,"Lee, Neil/0000-0002-4138-7163",Resolution Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M007111/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M007111/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M007111/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Resolution Foundation; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was supported by the Resolution Foundation and the Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M007111/1].

Yet this argument does not square well with the fact that enrollment into digital systems is often experienced (and presented by companies) as a much more benign process: signing up for a free service, responding to a friend's invitation, or being encouraged to share content. In this paper, we focus on the centrality of gifting and reciprocity to the business model and cultural imagination of digital capitalism. Relying on historical narratives and in-depth interviews with the designers and critics of digital systems, we explain the cultural genesis of these give-to-get relationships and analyze the socio-technical channels that structure them in practice. We suggest that the economic relation that develops as a result of a digital gift offering not only masks the structural asymmetry between giver and gifted but also permits the creation of the new commodity of personal data, obfuscates its true value, and naturalizes its private appropriation. We call this unique regime accumulation by gift.","[Fourcade, Marion] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Fourcade, Marion] Inst Adv Studies, Princeton, NJ USA; [Kluttz, Daniel N.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Informat, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Institute for Advanced Study - USA; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fourcade, M (corresponding author), 410 Barrows Hall 1980, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fourcade@berkeley.edu,,"Fourcade, Marion/0000-0002-4821-9031",UC Berkeley Center for LongTerm Cybersecurity; UC Berkeley Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group (AFOG),UC Berkeley Center for LongTerm Cybersecurity; UC Berkeley Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group (AFOG),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The authors thank the UC Berkeley Center for LongTerm Cybersecurity and the UC Berkeley Algorithmic Fairness and Opacity Working Group (AFOG) for funding support.",,106,52,57,0,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-9517,,,BIG DATA SOC,Big Data Soc.,JAN,2020,7,1,,,,,,,2.05395E+15,10.1177/2053951719897092,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053951719897092,,,16,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,KH8NP,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000510907800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We focus not on live streaming as a form of media production and consumption, but instead explore its newly central role in the contemporary political economy of the whole video games ecosystem. We explore three cases: streaming newly released games and the attendant role of streaming in informing consumer choice; the visibility and added lifespan that streaming is affording to independent and niche games and older games; and the live streaming of the creation of games, shedding light on the games industry and subverting ordinarily expensive or highly competitive game-design courses, training and employment paths. To do so, we draw on empirical data from offline and online fieldwork, including 100 qualitative interviews with professional live-streamers, offline ethnography at live-streaming events, and online ethnography and observation of Twitch streams. The article concludes that live streaming is a major new force in the games industry, creating new links between developers and influencers and shifting our expectations of game play and game design, and is consequently a platform whose major structural effects are only now beginning to be understood.","[Johnson, Mark R.] Univ Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Woodcock, Jamie] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England",University of Alberta; University of Oxford,"Johnson, MR (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Dept Polit Sci, 10-28 Henry Marshall Tory Bldg, Edmonton, AB T6G 2R3, Canada.",markrjohnsongames@gmail.com,"黄, 荣 昌/HGA-6762-2022; Woodcock, Jamie/A-1895-2015","Woodcock, Jamie/0000-0001-7097-305X; Johnson, Mark R/0000-0003-4622-650X",,,,,73,52,64,18,186,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0163-4437,1460-3675,,MEDIA CULT SOC,Media Cult.

However, although increasing, it is still a young and residual area of academic research. This paper aims to explore its concept, boundaries and various streams to offer a clarifying vision for researchers and tourism managers. Design/methodology/approach A systematization of the state of the art was carried out based on the papers contained in Web of Science and Scopus databases. Moreover, papers not indexed in these repositories (conference papers, book chapters, etc.) were searched through scientific social networks mainly. Findings In spite of recent efforts, halal tourism is a field of study still in a very early stage; however, on a practical level, the number of halal products and services is starting to increase worldwide. Nevertheless, there are challenges for the tourist industry in moving towards the authentication of the halal tourism offer, including among them the role of new technologies and the digital economy. Originality/value This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of halal tourism research. It highlights its main areas, gaps and questions for debate.

This article aims to bridge the gap between these two fields using Beck's theory of risk society to explore how the digital economy's momentum of innovation is generating risks and limiting the scope of existing democratic decision-making via the power of the digital economy to create social faits accomplis outside of democratic control. Three specific risks emerging from the dynamics of innovation of digital economies are discussed as vignettes to illustrate these developments: (1) the remaking of interpersonal co-presence and solitary life; (2) the growing threats of AI to intensify unemployment and inequality; and (3) the impact on the environment of an always on' and always upgrading' digital communication ecosystem. With the gap between the potential and the actual use value of the digitalization of the infrastructure of life continuing to grow, this article argues that a different relationship between digital innovation and private and public spheres needs to be established to protect the effectiveness of contemporary democracy.","[Curran, Dean] Univ Calgary, Sociol, Calgary, AB, Canada",University of Calgary,"Curran, D (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Sociol, Social Sci Bldg,2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",dcurran@ucalgary.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2015-00175],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada funded part of this research under grant 430-2015-00175.",,80,51,53,10,162,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1368-4310,1461-7137,,EUR J SOC THEORY,Eur.

However, to realize anticipated benefits, organizational leaders need a richer understanding of what drives individuals' innovation with incumbent organizational technologies. In support of that aim, this study theorized the processes by which a new concept in IS research, IT identity, motivates different forms of IT usage in the post-adoption context. We mapped these processes to two variance models and validated IT identity's influences for two different technologies. For theory, our results demonstrate IT identity's role as a key determinant of IT feature and exploratory usage, refine understanding of the nomological net of IT use, and create new opportunities to understand individuals' interactions with IT in the post-adoption context. For practice, this study offers actionable suggestions for how organizational leaders can encourage employees to leverage IT more effectively in their work. In doing so, this study opens the door for future investigations into the reciprocal relationship between individual IT usage and organizational and/or societal outcomes.","[Carter, Michelle] Washington State Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst & Entrepreneurship, Carson Coll Business, Todd Hall 442, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Petter, Stacie] Baylor Univ, Dept Informat Syst & Business Analyt, Hankamer Sch Business, One Bear Pl 98005, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Grover, Varun] Univ Arkansas, Dept Informat Syst, Walton Coll Business, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Thatcher, Jason Bennett] Temple Univ, Fox Sch Business, Dept Management Informat Syst, Speakman 210,1810 N 13th St, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Washington State University; Baylor University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Carter, M (corresponding author), Washington State Univ, Dept Management Informat Syst & Entrepreneurship, Carson Coll Business, Todd Hall 442, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",michelle.carter@wsu.edu; stacie_petter@baylor.edu; vgrover@uark.edu; jason.thatcher@temple.edu,"thatcher, Jason/KEH-3245-2024; Thatcher, Jason/AAX-3120-2021","Thatcher, Jason/0000-0002-7136-8836",,,,,153,50,59,41,295,SOC INFORM MANAGE-MIS RES CENT,MINNEAPOLIS,"UNIV MINNESOTA-SCH MANAGEMENT 271 19TH AVE SOUTH, MINNEAPOLIS, MN 55455 USA",0276-7783,,,MIS QUART,MIS Q.,SEP,2020,44,3,,,,,983,1021,,10.25300/MISQ/2020/14607,http://dx.doi.org/10.25300/MISQ/2020/14607,,,39,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science; Management",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science; Business & Economics,NZ0DY,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000576761700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, we ask: What is the optimal choice of revenue model? Using a novel theory-building method combining machine learning and multi-case theory building, we unpack optimal revenue model choice for a wide range of products on the App Store. Our primary theoretical contribution is a framework of high-performing revenue model-activity system configurations. Our core insight is the fit between value capture (revenue models) and value creation (activities) at the heart of successful business models. Contrastingly, low-performing products avoid complex value capture (i.e., freemium) and misunderstand value creation (e.g., overweight effort). Overall, we contribute a theoretically accurate and empirically grounded view of successful business models using a pioneering method for theory building using large, quantitative data sets. Managerial Summary Revenue models are critical for product performance. Yet, the high-performing choice is often unclear. We combine machine learning with multiple-case deep-dives to unpack optimal revenue model choice for a wide range of products on the App Store, a significant setting in the digital economy. Our primary insight is that high-performing products fit value capture (revenue models) and value creation (activity systems) to form coherent business models. Contrastingly, low-performing products avoid complex value capture (i.e., freemium) and misunderstand value creation (e.g., overweight effort and price). We also identify the importance of user resources, marketing, offline brand, and product complexity for specific revenue models. Overall, we contribute a framework for the optimal choice of revenue model and spotlight the revenue model-activity system configurations of successful business models.","[Tidhar, Ron; Eisenhardt, Kathleen M.] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Tidhar, R (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rtidhar@stanford.edu; kme@stanford.edu,,"Tidhar, Ron/0000-0001-8122-9840",,,,,63,50,56,48,296,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0143-2095,1097-0266,,STRATEGIC MANAGE J,Strateg.

Personal data is viewed as 'the oil' of the digital economy. Yet, ordinary people are barely aware of this. Marketers collect personal data at minimal cost in exchange for free services. But will this be possible in the long term, especially in the face of privacy concerns? Little is known about how users really value their personal data. In this paper, we build a user-centered value theory for personal data. On the basis of a survey experiment with 1269 Facebook users, we identify core constructs that drive the value of volunteered personal data. We find that privacy concerns are less influential than expected and influence data value mainly when people become aware of data markets. In fact, the consciousness of data being a tradable asset is the single most influential factor driving willingness-to-pay for data. Furthermore, we find that people build a sense of psychological ownership for their data and hence value it more. Finally, our value theory helps to unveil market design mechanisms that will influence how personal data markets thrive: First, we observe a majority of users become reactant if they are consciously deprived of control over their personal data; many drop out of the market. We therefore advice companies to consider user-centered data control tools to have them participate in personal data markets. Second, we find that in order to create scarcity in the market, centralized IT architectures (reducing multiple data copies) may be beneficial.","[Spiekermann, Sarah; Korunovska, Jana] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Management Informat Syst, Bldg D2,Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Spiekermann, S (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Management Informat Syst, Bldg D2,Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",,,,,,,,77,50,58,13,168,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0268-3962,1466-4437,,J INF TECHNOL-UK,J.

Today's environment is highly dependent on technological capabilities. Tracking contemporary technological development is becoming crucial at both micro and macro level. One of the major revolutions in modern business is switching from traditional to digital business models for achieving higher competitiveness level. Digitalization is one of the primary impetus of today's development. To accept and implement these changes, it is important to highlight the macromarketing role in this process. It is necessary to have concrete measures for identifying the shortcomings, good practices, and track the development. For this purpose, European Commission developed DESI to measure digital performance of European Union countries. This paper examines the DESI methodology and observes how the digital performance of EU affects main sustainable development components: economic, social, and environmental. Thus, the paper explores the correlations of DESI and other composite indices that measure sustainability components. Besides, the research examined the relationships between Hofstede's cultural dimensions and digital performance. The paper highlights the importance of digitalization as another crucial component of society's sustainable development.","[Jovanovic, Milica; Okanovic, Milan] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Dlacic, Jasmina] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ & Business, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Belgrade; University of Rijeka,"Jovanovic, M (corresponding author), Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Jove Ilica 154, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",milica.jovanovic@fon.bg.ac.rs; jasmina.dlacic@efri.hr; milan.okanovic@fon.bg.ac.rs,"Okanovic, Milan/S-9092-2018; Jovanović, Milica/AAM-6283-2020; Dlacic, Jasmina/I-4874-2018","Jovanović, Milica/0000-0001-7618-6356; Dlacic, Jasmina/0000-0002-3592-1876","University of Rijeka [ZP UNIRI 9/17]; Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [TR-32013]","University of Rijeka; Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","This paper has been supported by the University of Rijeka for project ZP UNIRI 9/17 and the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia project number TR-32013.",,71,49,50,14,109,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

This article focuses on the political economy of higher education (HE) digitalisation and suggests a new research programme. I foreground three principal arguments, which are empirically, theoretically, and politically crucial for HE scholars. First, most literature is examining the impacts of digitalisation on the HE sector and its subjects alone. I argue that current changes in digitalising HE cannot be studied in isolation from broader changes in the global economy. Specifically, HE digitalisation is embedded in the expansion of the digital economy, which is marked by new forms of value extraction and rentiership. Second, the emerging research on the intersection of marketisation and digitalisation in HE seems to follow the theories of marketisation qua production and commodification. I argue that we need theories with better explanatory power in analysing the current digitalisation dynamics. I propose to move from commodification to assetisation, and from prices to rents. Finally, universities are digitalising in the time when the practice is superseding policy, and there is no regulation beyond the question of data privacy. However, digital data property is already a reality, governed by 'terms of use', and protected by the intellectual property rights regime. The current pandemic has led to 'emergency pedagogy', which has intensified overall digitalisation in the sector and is bypassing concerns of data value redistribution. I argue that we urgently need public scrutiny and political action to address issues of value extraction and redistribution in HE.","[Komljenovic, Janja] Univ Lancaster, Educ Res, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Komljenovic, J (corresponding author), Univ Lancaster, Educ Res, Lancaster, England.",j.komljenovic@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Komljenovic, Janja/0000-0001-5951-5189",,,,,60,48,50,9,61,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0018-1560,1573-174X,,HIGH EDUC,High.

Specifically, we examine the direction of Granger causality between these variables. We find that the variables are cointegrated. Our empirical results also illustrate that both economic growth and the development of ICT infrastructure impact all stages of venture capital investment (early, late, and overall VC investment) in the long run. The study also shows that economic growth and late-stage venture capital investment impact internet usage; and internet usage and late-stage venture capital impact economic growth in the long run.

This article develops a practical framework that provides structure and guidance to policymakers who design policies for the digital economy. The framework differs from other approaches in taking the digital business models of platforms as the starting point for the analysis. The framework consists of three pillars, namely determining a platform's characteristics, relating these to public interests, and formulating policy options. The framework then invokes a return-path analysis for assessing how the interventions affect the business model, whether it has the desired effect on public interests, and ensuring it has no undesired side-effects on public interests. The framework puts forward two key messages for current discussions on digital platforms. First, one should look at the underlying characteristics of platforms rather than trying to understand digital platforms as a single category. Second, policymakers should explore existing rules and policy options, as they seem fit to deal with several characteristics of digital platforms in a time frame that matches the rapid development of platform technologies and business models. ?","[Nooren, Pieter] TNO, The Hague, Netherlands; [van Gorp, Nicolai] E Conomics, Rotterdam, Zuid Holland, Netherlands; [van Eijk, Nico] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Law, Media & Telecommun Law, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Eijk, Nico; Fathaigh, Ronan O.] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Law, Inst Informat Law, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Netherlands Organization Applied Science Research; University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam,"Fathaigh, RO (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Fac Law, Inst Informat Law, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.f.fahy@uva.nl,,,,,,,57,48,52,9,71,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,SEP,2018,10,3,,,,,264,301,,10.1002/poi3.177,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/poi3.177,,,38,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,GT1LB,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000444230300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Building a digital twin platform network can provide enterprises with a comprehensive view of products, manufacture, supply chain, customer experience, and profitability, which is conducive to the construction of a sustainable business model. The purpose of this paper is to study how enterprises use digital twin platform networks to generate economic, social and environmental benefits in various dimensions and their coupling relationships. Based on the literature review, this paper constructs a five-dimensional framework of a sustainable business model, and analyses the coupling relationship between dimensions. Using Haier as a way to verify the five-dimensional framework, it explores the dynamic mechanism of the Haier digital twin platform network, constructs an integrated framework based on coupling perspective and compares it with other two home appliance enterprises. The study shows that, through the digital twin platform network, enterprises can remove the disadvantage of focusing on a single product life cycle, and form a comprehensive network, so as to promote overall sustainable upgrades. This paper draws generic strategies and digital transformation suggestions for enterprises to innovate the sustainable business model. The conclusion enriches the research on sustainable business models both theoretically and practically and provides a feasible reference for the transformation of enterprises in digital economy environment.","[Li, Xiao; Cao, Jiarou; Liu, Zhenggang; Luo, Xinggang] Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Management Sch, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China",Hangzhou Dianzi University,"Li, X (corresponding author), Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Management Sch, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China.",lixiao@hdu.edu.cn; caojiarou@hdu.edu.cn; liuzhenggang@hdu.edu.cn; xgluo@hdu.edu.cn,,"li, xiao/0000-0002-5619-4313; Liu, Zheng Gang/0000-0001-8157-9349",Key projects of major Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities of Zhejiang Province [2016QN015]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71831006]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY18GO10008],Key projects of major Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities of Zhejiang Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province),"This research was funded by Key projects of major Humanities and Social Sciences in Universities of Zhejiang Province (grant number 2016QN015), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 71831006), and Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (grant number LY18GO10008).",,75,46,49,20,247,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2020,12,3,,,,,,,936,10.3390/su12030936,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12030936,,,26,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KT6PA,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000519135103039,View Full Record in Web of Science

That's because the measure is based on what people pay for goods and services. If something has a price of zero, then it typically contributes zero to GDP. Policy makers use GDP data to make decisions about how to invest in everything from infrastructure and R&D to education and cyberdefense, and regulators use economic data to set policy. Because the benefits of digitization are dramatically underestimated, those decisions and policies are being made with a poor understanding of reality. GDP-B is an alternate metric that supplements the traditional GDP framework by quantifying contributions to consumer well-being from new and free goods.","[Brynjolfsson, Erik] MIT Initiat Digital Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA; [Collis, Avinash] MIT Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Brynjolfsson, E (corresponding author), MIT Initiat Digital Econ, Cambridge, MA 02142 USA.",,"Collis, Avinash/HNI-3903-2023","Collis, Avinash/0000-0001-5582-9332",,,,,0,46,49,25,166,HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL PUBLISHING CORPORATION,WATERTOWN,"300 NORTH BEACON STREET, WATERTOWN, MA 02472 USA",0017-8012,,,HARVARD BUS REV,Harv.

Is there a set of core principles we can apply to thinking about the enabling potential of information technologies and their consequences for business and society? We present a business-centric framework and a technologycentric framework that together form a blueprint for answering these questions. The business-centric framework articulates three compelling reasons why information technology (IT) matters in business: (1) IT continually transform industry and society, (2) executive decisions about IT investments, governance, and strategy are critical to organizational success, and (3) deriving value from increasingly available data trails defines effective decision making in the digital economy. However, our conversations with the leadership of 45 business schools and our subsequent data indicate that business schools are challenged by effectively trail-ling future executives to think about these reasons and act on them as part of a forward-looking program of business education that is grounded in stable concepts. In response, the technology-centric framework provides a set of grounding concepts and stable principles about IT that have emerged over the last four decades, and leads to a natural set of consequences that can inform thinking about IT in business. We illustrate how these complementary frameworks-business and technology-can be combined to frame an educational program by outlining a set of key questions, by placing these questions in the context suggested by our frameworks, and by providing guidelines toward answering them. These questions also define a natural path for future research about IT in business and society that will lead to stronger intellectual foundations for the field and define future education that is better grounded in concepts and theories that emerge from academic research.","NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA",New York University,"Dhar, V (corresponding author), NYU, Stern Sch Business, New York, NY 10012 USA.",vdhar@stern.nyu.edu; asundara@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,39,46,59,7,119,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",1047-7047,1526-5536,,INFORM SYST RES,Inf.

The internet, and in particular the world wide web, have proved a powerful tool in both the manipulation of economic activities and the mobilization of civil society. Much is made of the democratizing effect of ICTs in e-government. Yet there are governments that attempt to control in an authoritarian manner both who accesses the internet and what content may be accessed and used. The question arises whether an information society and, more critically, a knowledge society can develop in the absence of freedom of access to information, freedom of expression and freedom to access the digital economy. Against this broad background the authors put forward four pillars of a knowledge society: (a) ICTs and connectivity, (b) content and the usability thereof, (c) infrastructure other than ICTs, and (d) human capacity. They attempt to evaluate the effect of authoritarian governmental control of access and content on each of them. It is argued from an ethical perspective, and more specifically from a perspective of social justice that, while a technologically oriented concept of the information society may not be incompatible with severe state control, a more multi-dimensional knowledge society cannot develop under such circumstances. Freedom is fundamental to participation in a knowledge society. Purely pragmatic arguments lead to the same conclusion.","Int Fed Lib Assoc & Inst, NL-2509 CH The Hague, Netherlands; Univ Pretoria, Dept Informat Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; Univ Wisconsin, Sch Informat Studies, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",University of Pretoria; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee,"Lor, PJ (corresponding author), Int Fed Lib Assoc & Inst, POB 95312, NL-2509 CH The Hague, Netherlands.",Peter.Lor@ifla.nl,,"Lor, Peter/0000-0001-6307-9068",,,,,31,46,66,0,51,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0165-5515,,,J INF SCI,J.

Two core dimensions of this ideology of technology in urban governance interact to consequentially reshape urban processes: (1) the priority of attracting high-technology industries as engines for urban economies and (2) the tendency to reframe urban problems into technological problems, to be addressed by technological solutions. Together, these mechanisms operate in conjunction to privilege technological needs, capacities, and priorities in urban governance, contributing to the widespread exclusion of people and problems beyond the scope of technology. Although not unprecedented, this ideology of technology has acquired renewed potency with neoliberalized urbanism, urban restructuring, and the ongoing information revolution. Furthermore, these changes intensify the ongoing transformation of cities (and space more generally) into digitized spaces tailored for capital accumulation in the context of digital and surveillance capitalism. To illustrate these dynamics, we briefly describe recent events in San Francisco, one of the key sites in the current techno-economic paradigm.

This paper aims to explore the current scope of research in regard to emerging service technologies by comparing the content of articles in academic journals with practitioner-oriented publication outlets. Design/methodology/approach A total of 5,118 technology-related articles from service journals, service conferences, business journals and business magazines are analyzed. Text-mining on abstracts is used for the thematic and semantic analysis. Common research themes and their relationships are depicted in a two-dimensional structured network. Further, the sample is analyzed regarding various technologies mentioned in the Gartner Hype Cycle. Findings The paper reveals differences in academic and business perspectives in regard to service technologies. In comparison to business journals, scientific service research is more focused on customer-related aspects of technology. Service research has a less concrete focus on technology than in business publications. Still, service conference articles show a broader scope of emerging service technologies than academic journal articles. Originality/value This paper serves as an introduction to the special issue Future Service Technologies. Additionally, a quantitative study of recent service technology research serves as a reality check for academic researchers on business reality and provides research and practical recommendations.","[Kunz, Werner H.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Mkt, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Heinonen, Kristina] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Mkt, Helsinki, Finland; [Lemmink, Jos G.

Smart city applications enable city authorities to monitor, manage, and provide plans for public resources and infrastructures in city environments, while offering citizens and businesses to develop and use intelligent services in cities. However, providing such smart city applications gives rise to several issues, such as semantic heterogeneity and trustworthiness of data sources, and extracting up-to-date information in real time from large-scale dynamic data streams. In order to address these issues, we propose a novel framework with an efficient semantic data processing pipeline, allowing for real-time observation of the pulse of a city. The proposed framework enables efficient semantic integration of data streams, and complex event processing on top of real-time data aggregation and quality analysis in a semantic Web environment. To evaluate our system, we use real-time sensor observations that have been published via an open platform called Open Data Aarhus by the City of Aarhus. We examine the framework utilizing symbolic aggregate approximation to reduce the size of data streams, and perform quality analysis taking into account both single and multiple data streams. We also investigate the optimization of the semantic data discovery and integration based on the proposed stream quality analysis and data aggregation techniques.","[Kolozali, Sefki] Univ Essex, IADS, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Colchester CO4 3ZL, Essex, England; [Kolozali, Sefki] Kings Coll London, MRC PHE Ctr Environm & Hlth, London SE1 9NH, England; [Bermudez-Edo, Maria; FarajiDavar, Nazli; Barnaghi, Payam] Univ Surrey, Inst Commun Syst, Elect Engn Dept, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Bermudez-Edo, Maria] Univ Granada, Sch Informat Technol & Telecommun, E-18014 Granada, Spain; [FarajiDavar, Nazli] Univ Oxford, Inst Biomed Engn, Oxford OX3 7DQ, England; [Gao, Feng; Ali, Muhammad Intizar] Natl Univ Ireland, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Galway H91 TK33, Ireland; [Mileo, Alessandra] Dublin City Univ, Insight Ctr Data Analyt, Dublin D09 V209 9, Ireland; [Fischer, Marten; Iggena, Thorben; Kuemper, Daniel; Tonjes, Ralf] Univ Appl Sci Osnabruck, Fac Engn & Comp Sci, D-49074 Osnabruck, Germany",University of Essex; University of London; King's College London; University of Surrey; University of Granada; University of Oxford; Dublin City University,"Kolozali, S (corresponding author), Univ Essex, IADS, Sch Comp Sci & Elect Engn, Colchester CO4 3ZL, Essex, England.",sefki.kolozali@gmail.com,"Barnaghi, Payam/ABE-9236-2020; Ali, Muhammad Intizar/P-9424-2016; Bermudez-Edo, Maria/ABI-5680-2020; Bermudez-Edo, Maria/D-6228-2018; Mileo, Alessandra/K-7175-2015","Barnaghi, Payam/0000-0001-8591-9638; Bermudez-Edo, Maria/0000-0002-2028-4755; Kolozali, Sefki/0000-0001-9920-1299; Farajidavar, Nazli/0000-0003-4412-6900; Ali, Muhammad Intizar/0000-0002-0674-2131; Mileo, Alessandra/0000-0002-6614-6462; Iggena, Thorben/0000-0001-8309-5620",European Commission [609035]; European Commissions Horizon 2020 IoTCrawler [779852],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); European Commissions Horizon 2020 IoTCrawler,"This work was supported in part by the European Commission's Seventh Framework Programme for the CityPulse Project under Grant 609035, and in part by the European Commissions Horizon 2020 IoTCrawler under Grant 779852.",,57,45,45,1,26,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2327-4662,,,IEEE INTERNET THINGS,IEEE Internet Things J.,APR,2019,6,2,,,,,2651,2668,,10.1109/JIOT.2018.2872606,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2018.2872606,,,18,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,HX7DP,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000467564700117,View Full Record in Web of Science

The study's findings also reveal that adaptive strategic planning can help regulate the effects of internal and external factors that shape individual and organizational responses to digital transformation, and that these factors promote regional competitiveness.","[Alam, Khorshed; Erdiaw-Kwasie, Michael Odei] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Alam, Khorshed; Erdiaw-Kwasie, Michael Odei] Univ Southern Queensland, Inst Resilient Reg, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia; [Shahiduzzaman, Md] Queensland Univ Technol, Chair Digital Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Shahiduzzaman, Md] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Ryan, Barbara] Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Arts & Commun, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia",University of Southern Queensland; University of Southern Queensland; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Southern Queensland,"Alam, K (corresponding author), Univ Southern Queensland, Sch Commerce, Toowoomba, Qld 4350, Australia.",khorshed.alam@usq.edu.au,"Shahiduzzaman, Md/JHT-6464-2023","Alam, Khorshed/0000-0003-2232-0745; erdiaw-kwasie, michael odei/0000-0003-1775-8013; Ryan, Barbara/0000-0002-3338-8887",Southern Downs Regional Council,Southern Downs Regional Council,"The authors would like to thank the Editor and anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments that greatly contributed to improving the final version of the paper.

This article attempts to survey different models that have been used in dynamic pricing. We first motivate dynamic pricing and present underlying concepts, with several examples, and explain conditions under which dynamic pricing is likely to succeed. We then bring out the role of models in computing dynamic prices. The models surveyed include inventory-based models, data-driven models, auctions, and machine learning.

Links between the power grid and telecommunications and between electrical power and oil, water, and gas pipelines continue to be a linchpin of energy supply networks. This strong interdependence means that an action in one part of one infrastructure network can rapidly create global effects by cascading throughout the same network or into other networks. The author explains how the Complex Interactive Network/Systems Initiative (CIN/SI), a joint industry-government initiative, is developing a mathematical basis and practical tools for improving the security, performance, reliability, and robustness of energy, financial, telecommunications, and transportation networks.

However, because crowdwork is temporary, large-scale, distributed, and mediated, its governance remains a challenge that often casts a shadow over its strategic value. The objective of this paper is to shed light on the making of value-adding crowdwork arrangements. Specifically, the paper explores crowdwork platform governance mechanisms and the relationships between these mechanisms and organizational value creation. Building on a comprehensive review of the extant literature on governance and crowdwork, we construct an overarching conceptual model that integrates control system and coordination system as two complementary mechanisms that drive crowdwork platform governance effectiveness and the consequent job provider benefits. Furthermore, the model accentuates the role of the degree of centralization and the degree of routinization as critical moderators in crowdwork platform governance. Overall, the paper highlights the potential of crowdwork to contribute not only to inclusion, fair wages and flexible work arrangements for workers but also to organizations' value and competitive edge.","[Gol, Elham Shafiei; Stein, Mari-Klara; Avital, Michel] Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Gol, ES (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",esg.digi@cbs.dk; ms.digi@cbs.dk; michel@avital.net,"Londe, Pedro/AAG-2267-2019","Avital, Michel/0000-0002-9089-441X; Stein, Mari-Klara/0000-0002-8916-2158; Shafiei Gol, Elham/0000-0001-9173-4162",,,,,108,44,46,17,198,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0963-8687,1873-1198,,J STRATEGIC INF SYST,J.

Nowadays, data centers (DCs) contain thousands of different machines running a huge number of diverse applications over an extended period. Resource management in Cloud is an open issue since an efficient resource allocation can reduce the infrastructure running cost. In this paper, we propose a snapshot-based solution for server consolidation problem from Cloud infrastructure provider (CIP) perspective. Our proposed mathematical formulation aims at reducing power cost by employing efficient server consolidation, and also considering the issues such as (i) mapping incoming and failing virtual machines (VMs), (ii) reducing a total number of VM migrations and (iii) consolidating running server workloads. We also compare the performance of our proposed model to the well-known Best Fit heuristics and its extension to include server consolidation via VM migration denoted as Best Fit with Consolidation (BFC). Our proposed mathematical formulation allows us to measure the solution quality in absolute terms, and it can also be applicable in practice. In our simulations, we show that relevant improvements (from 6% to 15%) over the widely adopted Best Fit algorithm achieved in a reasonable computing time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Digital platforms and market power in the data-driven economy,COMPETITION & CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Digital economy; big data; entry barriers; price discrimination; digital platforms; innovation,INNOVATION; COMPETITION; PATTERNS,"Digital transformation has triggered a process of concentration in several markets for information goods with digital platforms rising to dominate key industries by leveraging on network externalities and economies of scale in the use of consumer data. The policy debate, therefore, focuses on the market control allegedly held by incumbents who build their competitive advantage on big data. In this paper, we evaluate the risk of abuse of a dominant position by analysing three major aspects highlighted in economic theory: entry barriers, price discrimination, and potential for technological improvement. Drawing on industrial and information economics, we argue that the very nature of big data, on the one hand, prompts market concentration and, on the other, limits the possibility of abuse. This claim is not an a-priori apologia of large incumbents in digital markets, but rather an attempt to argue that market concentration is not necessarily detrimental when it stimulates continuous innovation. Nonetheless, the concentration of power in a few global players should raise other concerns linked with the supranational nature of these firms, which can easily cherry-pick locations to exploit tax competition among countries or more favourable privacy legislation and the fair use of data.","[Nuccio, Massimiliano; Guerzoni, Marco] Univ Torino, DESPINA Lab, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Lungodora Siena 100A, I-10153 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Nuccio, M (corresponding author), Univ Torino, DESPINA Lab, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti de Martiis, Lungodora Siena 100A, I-10153 Turin, Italy.",massimiliano.nuccio@unito.it,"NUCCIO, Massimiliano/N-3165-2019; Silva, Flavio/JTT-2763-2023; Klitzke, Karina/IXD-3488-2023; guerzoni, marco/AAB-3416-2021","NUCCIO, Massimiliano/0000-0002-0751-2143; guerzoni, marco/0000-0001-7415-0771",,,,,57,43,47,15,206,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-5294,1477-2221,,COMPET CHANG,Compet.

Although the interest in business models (BM) has risen significantly since the late 1990s, little is known about BMI practices in small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), representing a majority of enterprises in the European market. Our study addresses this research gap and focuses on the investigation of drivers and outcomes of BMI in SMEs. A partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) method was used to empirically test the model using data collected in 2017 from 71 SMEs in Slovenia. Results have shown that the innovativeness of enterprises and their business environment has a positive impact on the level of BMI activities in the enterprises. However, this is not the case of fast developing and rapidly changing information technology. In addition, the results show that the level of BMI has a positive impact on BMI outcomes and further on overall business performance. The results contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of BMI activities in SMEs and offer useful insights to SMEs that intend to innovate their business model(s) and government to create a supportive environment.","[Pucihar, Andreja; Lenart, Gregor; Borstnar, Mirjana Kljajic; Vidmar, Doroteja; Marolt, Marjeta] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Kranj 4000, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Pucihar, A (corresponding author), Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Kranj 4000, Slovenia.",andreja.pucihar@fov.uni-mb.si; gregor.lenart@fov.uni-mb.si; mirjana.kljajic@fov.uni-mb.si; doroteja.vidmar@fov.uni-mb.si; marjeta.marolt@fov.uni-mb.si,"Borstnar, Mirjana Kljajic/R-6630-2019; Marolt, Marjeta/X-3149-2019; Borštnar, Mirjana Kljajić/AAB-3150-2020","Marolt, Marjeta/0000-0002-9868-3545; Borštnar, Mirjana Kljajić/0000-0003-4608-9090; Pucihar, Andreja/0000-0001-5750-1939; Vidmar, Doroteja/0000-0001-9254-589X",European Unions's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program [645791]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [645791] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Unions's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(European Union (EU)); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),The work leading to these results has received funding from European Unions's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program (2014-2020) under grant agreement No. 645791.

In the United Kingdom, crowdfunding is a particularly diverse and dynamic economy: the forms taken by funding now range from donations to business loans and the issue of equities by start-up enterprises, and recent rapid growth is concentrated in the financial market circuits of crowdfunding. This article analyzes the changing composition of the crowdfunding economy in the United Kingdom as a process of financial marketization and develops a sympathetic critical engagement with cultural economy scholarship on the geographies of money and finance. Consistent with previous cultural economy research into sociotechnical processes, the financial market circuits of crowdfunding are shown to be produced through the mobilization of economic theory and the enrollment of calculative market devices. When calling for a broadening of the existing analytical remit of cultural economy scholarship, however, emphasis is also placed on both regulation and governance and monetary valuations as constitutive and relational forces in the assembly of markets in the making. Regulation and governance are shown to deploy sovereign powers and techniques to territorialize, legitimize, and bolster the financial market circuits of crowdfunding. Money, meanwhile, is shown to play a dual role. While it certainly enables calculative and marketized valuations, money simultaneously creates scope for a multiplicity of values to be inscribed into its circulations such that the diversity of the crowdfunding economy persists and proliferates amidst financial marketization.","[Langley, Paul] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England",Durham University,"Langley, P (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",paul.langley@durham.ac.uk,,"Langley, Paul/0000-0002-1924-7711",Durham Geography's Research Development Fund,Durham Geography's Research Development Fund,"The author acknowledges the support provided by Durham Geography's Research Development Fund for the research that underpins the article, and also thanks Christian Borch, Gavin Bridge, Chris Clarke, Brett Christophers, Andrew Leyshon, John Morris, Matthias Thiemann, and three anonymous reviewers for their comments on earlier versions of this article.",,76,43,45,4,132,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

As a new source of value creation, a start-up's business model is critical for its survival and growth. How, then, should a digital start-up design its business model? The present study departs from existing viewpoints on the topic and proposes a strategic orientation view. By integrating the resource-based view and the demand-side perspective, we examine the impact of strategic orientation in business model design on the performance of start-ups in the digital economy. Using a data set of digital start-ups, our empirical results show that both technology and consumer orientations are beneficial to the performance of start-ups. However, it would be counterproductive for a digital start-up to seek a balance between both strategic orientations in business model design. Furthermore, the positive relationship between consumer orientation and firm performance becomes more prominent in a highly open technological environment, but is weakened in environments characterized by high user interactivity. This study advances business model design research by proposing a strategic orientation view, and contributes to business model theory building by offering an integrated view that embraces the resource-based view and the demand-side perspective.","[Guo, Hai; Wang, Chao] Renmin Univ China, Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Su, Zhongfeng] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Donghan] Commun Univ China, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Xi'an Jiaotong University; Communication University of China,"Su, ZF (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",Zhongfengsu@163.com,"Guo, Hai/GZG-6850-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71872178, 71772167, 71472185]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are grateful for the insightful comments provided by the former editor-in-chief Gloria Barczak, the editor-in-chief Charles Noble, the associate editor, and three anonymous reviewers.

This article critiques and develops this concept, with specific reference to work in the media industries, by presenting a historically grounded typology of free labor that also highlights some of the analytical problems with the current use of the concept. Our typology presents seven metaphors of free labor based on historical instances of roles people have taken on when performing unpaid labor: those of The Slave, The Carer, The Apprentice, The Prospector, The Hobbyist, The Volunteer, and The Patsy. A key conclusion is that free labor is performed by different actors at either end of increasingly complex and temporally stretched out value chains. This necessitates a more fine-grained and historicized use of the concept of free labor.","[Fast, Karin; Ornebring, Henrik; Karlsson, Michael] Karlstad Univ, Univ Gatan, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden",Karlstad University,"Fast, K (corresponding author), Karlstad Univ, Univ Gatan, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.",karin.fast@kau.se,"Karlsson, Michael/D-5887-2013",,,,,,111,42,47,2,60,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0163-4437,1460-3675,,MEDIA CULT SOC,Media Cult.

The development of the digital economy correlates with the dynamics of educational, scientific and technical, and innovative activities in the country. Higher education particularly affects the development of the digital economy because it is a system training highly qualified personnel, conducting quality research, and generating innovations. The purpose of the article is the identification of promising vectors of higher education system development under the conditions of digitalization of national economy. Section 1 of the article presents the authors' methodological approach to assessment the impact of educational, research, and innovation components on digital economy development. The implementation of the authors' approach covers the phased use of methods of statistical, index, cluster and system analysis. The influence of higher education on the structural components of the digital economy (educational, research, innovative ones) is grounded. The result of the study was the identification of main trends in the development of higher education under the conditions of digital economy. The problems of the development of higher education are systematized in the groups: contextual, legal, organizational and economic, financial, logistical problems, and problems of internationalization Based on the results of the analysis, the authors conclude the necessity of development of a conceptual base for increasing the digital adaptability of the higher education system to new socio-economic conditions. Section 2 of the article describes the concept of the digital adaptability strategy of the higher education system. The concept was developed on the base of structural and functional, systemic and synergetic, and institutional approaches. The proposed concept is based on the idea of deepening the long-term partnership of universities with stakeholders within the Quadruple Helix model. In the conclusion section, the authors highlight the key priorities of the digital adaptability strategy of the higher education system.","[Kholiavko, N.; Dubyna, M.; Lavrov, R.] Natl Univ Chernihiv Polytech, Dept Finance Banking & Insurance, Chernihiv, Ukraine; [Djakona, A.] ISMA Univ Appl Sci, Mkt Dept, Riga, Latvia; [Zhavoronok, A.] Yuriy Fedkovych Chernivtsi Natl Univ, Fac Finance Business & Accounting, Chernovtsy, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Chernihiv Polytechnic National University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Yuri Fedkovych Chernivtsi National University,"Kholiavko, N (corresponding author), Natl Univ Chernihiv Polytech, Dept Finance Banking & Insurance, Chernihiv, Ukraine.",nateco@meta.ua; antonina.djakona@isma.lv; maksim-32@ukr.net; artur.zhavoronok@ukr.net; lavrus2017@gmail.com,"Djakona, Antonina/Q-8612-2018; Zhavoronok, Artur Vitaliiovych/M-7792-2019; Kholiavko, Nataliia/N-1229-2019; Dubyna, Mariia/I-4909-2017; Lavrov, Ruslan/I-1733-2014","Djakona, Antonina/0000-0002-4089-9335; Zhavoronok, Artur Vitaliiovych/0000-0001-9274-8240; Kholiavko, Nataliia/0000-0003-2951-7233; Lavrov, Ruslan/0000-0002-9655-4467",Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine,Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine,This research is carried out within the framework of the scientific project Integrated Model of Competitive Higher Education in Ukraine under the Quadruple Helix Concept with the support of the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine.,,34,41,41,8,41,NATL ACAD SCI REPUBLIC KAZAKHSTAN,ALMATY,"28, SHEVCHENKO ST, ALMATY, 050010, KAZAKHSTAN",1991-3494,2518-1467,,BULL NATL ACAD SCI R,Bull.

Regression analysis shows that consumer demand, net transactional benefits and perceived accessibility of accepting crypto-payments influence adoption intention and actual acceptance. Our findings also suggest that service providers who act as intermediaries in e-commerce play a crucial role as facilitators of competition and innovation by increasing accessibility. The most serious barrier for crypto-acceptance is a lack of consumer demand. It seems therefore unlikely that crypto adoption by online retailers will increase substantially in the near future.","[Jonker, Nicole] De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands",European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"Jonker, N (corresponding author), De Nederlandsche Bank, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",n.jonker@dnb.nl,,,,,,,34,41,42,6,87,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1567-4223,1873-7846,,ELECTRON COMMER R A,Electron.

Design/methodology/approach - A case study methodology is followed, using not only semi-structured interviews but also secondary data to triangulate the obtained information. For the interviews, the authors have considered not only employees in different strategic positions, from middle management to top management, but also participants in the main supplier, to obtain a holistic perspective of the knowledge acquisition and appropriation in the innovation process. Findings - For the improvements of the process of knowledge acquisition and appropriation, organizations should configure internal and external networks to support this process reorganizing their classical structures. Moreover, this process is enhanced by the support of top managers and innovation champions, which act as sponsors and facilitators of the project respectively, to ensure that the whole process runs smoothly. At the end, to deal with new kinds of projects that are completely different to previous ones, it is recommended to be open to new ways of organizing and structuring participants; hence, coordination and socialization mechanisms are important to reach not only potential absorptive capacity (associated with knowledge acquisition) but also realized absorptive capacity (associated with knowledge exploitation). This situation is even more relevant in Web 2.0 environments, where each participant has autonomy to participate actively, be just a passive participant, or cease to belong to the community. Practical implications - The paper's findings could be useful to identify the determinants of knowledge acquisition and appropriation because they could guide organizations in the development of external and internal networks to support this process, which would be used to promote innovation within the organization; and with this identification, organizations could take actions based on their organizational requirements and goals. It is important to note that organizational boundaries are shifting from being closed to be permeable, enabling a better interaction with key partners and facilitating the knowledge exchange. However, this situation offers new challenges for organizations that want to be leaders in the near future because traditional organizations should shift their old paradigms, having an organizational culture more aligned with Web 2.0 philosophy (e.g. collaboration and sharing), which is the paradigm of the new digital economy Originality/value - This study is a step forward to understand the relationship between external and internal networks that act as enablers of knowledge acquisition and appropriation. The authors extend the knowledge-based view by applying it in a Web 2.0 context, highlighting coordination and socialization mechanisms as critical success factors to integrate internal and external knowledge. Finally, the inclusion of interviews of employees from the main supplier of BBVA in these kinds of projects provides a holistic perspective of the process of knowledge acquisition and appropriation.","[Bohorquez Lopez, Victor Wilfredo] PUCP, CTR Catolica, Lima, Peru; [Esteves, Jose] IE Business Sch, Informat Syst Area, Madrid, Spain",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru; IE University,"Lopez, WB (corresponding author), PUCP, CTR Catolica, Lima, Peru.",victor.bohorquez@pucp.edu.pe,"Lopez, Victor Wilfredo Bohorquez/AAF-2448-2020","Lopez, Victor Wilfredo Bohorquez/0000-0002-1504-5899",,,,,75,41,55,0,136,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1367-3270,1758-7484,,J KNOWL MANAG,J.

Most of the scientific papers related to this topic examine the general outlook of cloud computing implementation in Romania and focus on the use of the afore-mentioned technologies by large scale companies. In order to identify the factors that have an influence over the choice of Romanian SMEs to adopt cloud computing technology, a conceptual model has been set forth. The model's dependent variable is the choice of the company's management to implement cloud computing technologies. Five different independent types of variable structures which have an effect on the adoption of cloud computing within SMEs were identified. The five categories of variables are competition & government, ICT providers & firm departments, employee, manager and technological factors. Each of these categories of determinants encompasses at their turn two or more constructs. An online survey tested the model based on the responses of managers and directors from 198 Romanian SMEs from the cities of Bucharest and Cluj. The validity of the model was performed by completing factor analysis and reliability tests of the data; a logistic regression analysis was deployed to test the research hypotheses. The results emphasized that the managers' know-how on cloud computing and the perceived costs of implementing the technology represent the main components influencing the spreading of cloud computing among Romanian SMEs. This study makes a valuable contribution to the academic environment but to businesses as well. The model can be used to examine the implementation of different innovative applications. Companies which offer cloud computing services could take advantage of the outcomes of this study to expand the degree of cloud service introduction among SMEs.","[Dinca, Violeta Mihaela; Dima, Alina Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm Foreign Languages, UNESCO Dept Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania; [Rozsa, Zoltan] Alexander Dubcek Univ Trencin, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Dept Management & Human Resources Dev, Trencin, Slovakia",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Dima, AM (corresponding author), Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Business Adm Foreign Languages, UNESCO Dept Business Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",alina.dima@fabiz.ase.ro,"Rozsa, Zoltan/E-1043-2013; Vasilache, Simona N/B-2909-2010; Dima, Alina Mihaela/AAL-2950-2020; Dinca, Violeta Mihaela/A-7239-2016; Dima, Alina/AAQ-6730-2021","Rozsa, Zoltan/0000-0002-5748-5702; Dinca, Violeta Mihaela/0000-0002-2335-7649; Dima, Alina Mihaela/0000-0002-8911-2003",Romanian government through CERTRAN project -The Upgrade of the Research Capacity in Economics through Development of a Transdisciplinary Research Infrastructure,Romanian government through CERTRAN project -The Upgrade of the Research Capacity in Economics through Development of a Transdisciplinary Research Infrastructure,The research published in this article has been supported by the Romanian government through CERTRAN project -The Upgrade of the Research Capacity in Economics through Development of a Transdisciplinary Research Infrastructure.,,33,40,44,3,26,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The occurrence of several cascading failures in the past 40 years has helped focus attention on the need to understand the complex phenomena associated with these interconnected systems and to develop defense plans to protect the network against extreme contingencies caused by natural disasters, equipment failures, human errors, or deliberate sabotage and attacks. With dramatic increases in interregional bulk power transfers and accelerating diversity of transactions among parties, the electric power grid is being used in ways for which it was not originally designed. As the power grids become heavily loaded with long-distance transfers, the already complex system dynamics become even more important. The potential for rare events but high-impact cascading phenomena represent just a few of many new science and technology challenges. We focus on the lessons learned as well as challenges associated with accomplishing these missions, including recent hardware, software, applications, and algorithmic developments.","Univ Minnesota, Ctr Dev Technol Leadership, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; Univ Minnesota, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Amin, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Ctr Dev Technol Leadership, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",amin@umn.edu,,,,,,,52,40,47,1,18,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855 USA",0018-9219,,,P IEEE,Proc.

This article is an attempt to reveal the effects of policy uncertainty on Bitcoin returns with economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in the US, the UK, Japan, China, and Hong Kong. Furthermore, we also present the results of monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) on the Bitcoin market. The robust estimations from the quantile regression and Markov regime-switching model show that Bitcoin returns are affected by EPU. One of the essential findings is that Bitcoin returns are more responsive to EPU in the US, China, and Japan. In the US and Japan, uncertainty has a negative effect on the Bitcoin market whereas in China it has a positive effect. Global MPU uncertainty is also significant in explaining Bitcoin exchange rates. Moreover, the Bitcoin market is negatively affected by uncertainty in Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the gross domestic product, and other macroeconomic data.

Workerism took up many of these questions in the context of the factory - particularly through the Italian Operaismo - connecting the experience of the workplace with a broader struggle against capitalism. However, there are many differences between those factories and the new digital workplaces in which many workers find themselves today. The methods of workers' inquiry and the theories of class composition are a useful legacy from Operaismo, providing tools and a framework to make sense of and intervene within workers' struggles today. However, these require sharpening and updating in a digital context. In this article, we discuss the challenges and opportunities for a digital workerism, understood as both a research and organising method. We use the case study of Uber to discuss how technology can be used against workers, as well as repurposed by them in various ways. By developing an analysis of the technical, social, and political re-composition taking place on the platform, we move beyond determinist readings of technology, to place different technologies within the social relations that are emerging. In particular, we draw attention to the new forms through which workers' struggles can be circulated. Through this, we argue for a digital workerism that develops a critical understanding of how the workplace can become a key site for the struggles of digital/communicative socialism.","[Englert, Sai] Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands; [Woodcock, Jamie] Open Univ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Cant, Callum] Univ West London, London, England",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Open University - UK; University of West London,"Englert, S (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Leiden, Netherlands.",s.p.englert@hum.leidenuniv.nl; jamie.woodcock@googlemail.com; callumcant@gmail.com,"Woodcock, Jamie/A-1895-2015","Woodcock, Jamie/0000-0001-7097-305X; Englert, Sai/0000-0002-8272-2538",,,,,48,39,45,1,9,TRIPLEC,NORTHWICK PARK,"WATFORD RD, NORTHWICK PARK, HA1 3TP, ENGLAND",1726-670X,,,TRIPLEC-COMMUN CAPIT,TRIPLEC-Commun.

Computing saw the development of the semiconductor transistor, integrated circuit, personal computers (PCs), operating systems, and graphical interfaces. The physical layer of telecommunication was enabled via the emergence of optical fiber and new wireless communication technologies, while networking saw the development of the lnternet (essentially packet switching) and the World Wide Web. These advances combined to realize a series of new applications of information and communications technologies (ICTs) such as business software, e-mail, and e-commerce. However, progress seriously stumbled with the collapse of the dot com bubble, which among other things revealed a huge amount of misdirected investment that could have been used more productively. The question of the day is thus how to realize new killer apps to stimulate a new round of growth. The use of cell phones for communicating text, pictures, and video is a rapidly expanding area, but it seems unlikely that these applications will have a macroeconomic impact. Entertainment is a key industry whose fortunes are entwined with ICTs. Indeed, the application of ICT to innovating entertainment products is an important driver for the continued growth of the industry. Distribution of music and video via the Web could significantly stimulate demand but also raises the thorny question of how to protect intellectual property rights (IPR) of content providers. Another possible killer apps are interactive video-on-demand and telecalls/teleconferencing. The latter would, among other things, stimulate adoption of telework. The current Internet is capable of handing neither one-way transmissions of high-quality video nor interactive video-on-demand. There are bottlenecks both for the last mile connection from Internet service provider (ISP) to the home but also the first miles from originating server to ISP. The effective first miles bandwidth has not increased along with improvements in equipment, essentially because demand increases with capacity and thus traffic jams on the net continue. Digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies over telephone wires, and possibly wireless networks, will play important roles in getting over the last mile hurdle. Upgrading the first miles will probably require new networking protocols beyond TCP/IP that support multimedia and also changes in the economic model of information transfer via the Net.

These have made some countries to be categorised as relatively high and others relatively low in terms of their scale on digital economy. Thus, this study empirically investigates the interaction of information and communication technology (ICT) adoption and innovation, and the role of this digitalisation interaction on financial development in Africa, and across the sub-regions. It utilises the Bayesian Vector Auto-Regressive (BVAR) modelling to simulate the impulse response function and variance decomposition across Africa. The study finds that ICT-innovation interaction shock positively drives financial development across all of 6 datasets.

Interpretations tend to refer to an average type that does not exist in practice, and there are problems of coherence, demarcations, and overlap. Examining macro-level patterns of self-employment, a number of patterns emerge. First, self-employment includes both marginal and privileged positions, within individual countries and also in international comparisons. It can put people at risk of precariousness and poverty or it can be a vehicle to bring wealth to individuals and enterprises, contributing jobs and economic growth to society. Second, people increasingly switch between wage- or salary-dependent labor and self-employment and hybrid forms of employment, as forms of micro entrepreneurship are combined with dependent labor. Third, internationally, the ratio of women in solo self-employment is higher than that of men. Fourth, remarkable differences exist at the level of solo self-employment.","[Boegenhold, Dieter] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Fac Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Boegenhold, Dieter] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Dept Sociol, Klagenfurt, Austria; [Boegenhold, Dieter] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Doctoral Program Entrepreneurship Innovat & Econ, Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Klagenfurt; University of Klagenfurt; University of Klagenfurt,"Bögenhold, D (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Univ Str 65-67, A-9020 Klagenfurt, Austria.",dieter.boegenhold@aau.at,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023; Bögenhold, Dieter/J-7750-2012","Bögenhold, Dieter/0000-0003-2893-3534",,,,,92,38,39,3,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7642,1552-3381,,AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

Using a systematisation that considers environmental effects of information and communication technologies as direct, indirect and structural, this article discerns the future socio-environmental scenarios indicative of each value model. We argue that the two value models share the same type of direct environmental effects associated with a similar technological infrastructure; however, their indirect effects differ in prospects of consumer behaviour, environmental awareness and product design. Likewise the difference in structural effects is significant as the NFCC is based on profit maximisation and an accumulation of capital, whereas the HMPP is agnostic to growth and oriented towards the commons. Hence, the latter is considered as the socio-environmentally auspicious choice, but comes not without transitional challenges of its own. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

That question animates the contributions to a double special issue-one in theReview of International Political Economy, and a companion one inNew Political Economy. The global financial crisis had seemed to vindicate broad-ranging IPE perspectives at the expense of narrow economics theories. Yet the tumultuous decade since then has confronted IPE scholars with rapidly-shifting global dynamics, many of which had remained underappreciated. We use the Blind Spots moniker in an attempt to push the topics covered here higher up the scholarly agenda-issues that range from institutionalized racism and misogyny to the rise of big tech, intensifying corporate power, expertise-dynamics in global governance, assetization, and climate change. Gendered and racial inequalities as blind spots have a particular charge. There has been a self-reinforcing correspondence between topics that have counted as important, people to whom they matter personally, and the latter's ability to build careers on them. In that sense, our mission is not only to highlight collective blind spots that may dull IPE's capacity to theorize the current moment. It is also a normative one-a form of disciplinary housekeeping to help correct both intellectual and professional entrenched biases.","[LeBaron, Genevieve] Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Mugge, Daniel] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Best, Jacqueline] Univ Ottawa, Sch Polit Studies, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hay, Colin] Univ Sheffield, SPERI, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Hay, Colin] SciencePo, CEE CNRS, Paris, France",University of Sheffield; University of Amsterdam; University of Ottawa; University of Sheffield,"Mügge, D (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, NL-1018 WV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",d.k.muegge@uva.nl,"LeBaron, Genevieve/JJF-3645-2023; /K-2994-2013","Mugge, Daniel/0000-0001-9408-7597; Best, Jacqueline/0000-0001-5235-2057; /0000-0003-0083-6126; Hay, Colin/0000-0001-6327-6547",,,,,23,37,39,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

At the nexus of technological infrastructure, social organization, and interpersonal relations, the authors aim to explicate the complex dynamics between the gift economy and the commodity economy in the context of the increasingly platformized Chinese society. This paper will first discuss how the platform infrastructure is geared toward maximizing content monetization through virtual gifting. The paper then examines how corporatized streamer guilds foreground the moneymaking capacity of virtual gifting at the expense of its potential for building communitarian and reciprocal relationships. Based on these structural dynamics, the commodification of virtual relations is further analyzed to demonstrate how the hegemonic construct of virtual gifting is perceived and reproduced at the individual level. The paper concludes by offering a reconsideration of the role of critical communication studies in turning the tide of China's live streaming industry.","[Zhang, Xiaoxing] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Xiang, Yu] Shanghai Univ, Sch Journalism & Commun, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hao, Lei] Univ London, Goldsmiths Coll, Dept Media Commun & Cultural Studies, London, England",Simon Fraser University; Shanghai University; University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"Zhang, XX (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Commun, Vancouver, BC, Canada.",xiaoxing_zhang@sfu.ca,"Xiang, Yu/AFN-1182-2022; Hao, Lei/ACD-1499-2022","Xiang, Yu/0000-0003-3332-2113; Hao, Lei/0000-0001-6722-0989",,,,,57,37,39,18,116,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1754-4750,1754-4769,,CHIN J COMMUN,Chin.

While using social media platforms is ostensibly free, users nevertheless pay for these services through their personal data-enabling advertisers, content developers, and other third parties to profile, predict, and position individuals. Such developments have prompted calls for social media users to adopt more informed and critical stances toward how and why their data are being used-that is, to build critical data literacies. This article reports on research that explores young social media users' understandings of their personal data and its attendant issues. Drawing on research with groups of young people (aged 13-17 years), the article investigates the consequences of making third party (re) uses of personal data openly available for social media users to interpret and make critical sense of. The findings provide valuable insights into young people's understandings of the technical, social, and cultural issues that underpin their ability to engage with, and make sense of, social media data.

The study utilized a 17 item list of potential disclosure items (name, email address, etc.), categorized reliably into six sub-indices: contact information, payment information, life history information, financial/medical information, work-related information, and online account information. Online disclosure consciousness (ODC) is introduced as a framework to conceptualize, explain the study's findings, and empirically measure the gap between one's willingness to disclose and perceived risk pertaining to the overall 17-item index used in the study, the sub-indices, and particular items. The results show significant gaps among participants both within and across nations. Despite Estonia's advanced adoption and progressive policies and practices toward the Internet, Americans are more willing to disclose, and less concerned about perceived risks. The findings suggest willingness to disclose and risk aversion can and should be analyzed empirically together. The theoretical model provides an alternative conceptualization to the ideas of the privacy paradox, privacy calculus, and privacy cost-benefit ratios. Implications for theory, consumers, marketing practice, and public policy are discussed. Importantly, the study can inform increased adoption of ecommerce and the digital economy, while also protecting consumer's personal data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the years, however, this expression has evolved into an umbrella term, used to describe a variety of practices and instances concerning the broader relationship between labour and digital technology - including paid work - often with little or no relation to the original theory. Reflecting on this evolution, this article argues that 'digital labour' has become a kind of empty signifier, unable to serve a clearly distinguishable critical or analytical purpose. Focusing on the emergence of platform labour, it shows how 'digital' and 'labour' have come to be largely inseparable dimensions and discusses the related implications.","[Gandini, Alessandro] Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Gandini, A (corresponding author), Univ Milan, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",alessandro.gandini@unimi.it,,"Gandini, Alessandro/0000-0002-7705-7625",,,,,63,36,36,47,221,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0163-4437,1460-3675,,MEDIA CULT SOC,Media Cult.

However, previous research paid rare attention to how to provide trade promotions in a sustainable manner when consumer demand is disrupted. Considering that demand disruption is becoming surging because of the digital economy, it is quite necessary to discern the managerial implications for sustainable trade promotion practice in demand disruption scenarios. For this purpose, we analyze trade promotions under demand disruption by integrating demand uncertainty and limited capacity into a stylized demand disruption model. Three trade promotion types, i.e. off-invoice, scan-back, and revenue-sharing, are examined, and optimal promotion decisions are derived for each strategy. Our results show that both manufacturer and retailer would adopt aggressive pricing strategies as the demand disruption being intensified. For trade promotion strategies, our results show that, for a certain level of demand disruption, the manufacturer prefers off-invoice rather than revenue-sharing when the manufacturer needs to offer a more aggressive trade promotion. This result indicates that, when aggressive trade promotions are needed, the manufacturer may be worse off by a revenue-sharing strategy, even though the revenue-sharing could coordinate a supply chain.","[Wu, Jie; Chen, Zhixin; Ji, Xiang] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Ji, X (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Management, Hefei, Peoples R China.",jacky012@mail.ustc.edu.cn; chenzhix@mail.ustc.edu.cn; signji@mail.ustc.edu.cn,,,,,,,89,36,38,15,88,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

The vast distances between urban and rural centres present challenges to the provision of essential infrastructure like roads, transport, energy - and telecommunications. Within this last category, internet connectivity and skills are both increasingly necessary and historically less available to the regional and rural agricultural sector in comparison to other industries and geographic communities. The digital inclusion agenda in Australia aims to address such gaps by promoting and supporting people and communities to use technology to improve social and economic well-being. This article builds on research underpinning the Australian Digital Inclusion Index (ADII), which defines digital inclusion as the capacity of people to access, afford and use online technologies effectively. The article focuses on the nature and extent of digital inclusion for Australia's farmers (identified as farmers and farm managers) based on analysis of a customised set of primary data extracted from the ADII dataset. This analysis reveals generally low levels of digital inclusion in rural communities, particularly among farmers, with distinctive and complex characteristics across measures of Access, Affordability and Digital Ability. Our findings highlight a perplexing scenario in which farmers score poorly on the Index when compared to Australians who live in similar circumstances but are not employed in the farming sector. We attribute lower levels of access to limited internet technology options, lower data speeds, inadequate reliability and lower data allowances. Less affordability is associated with individual-level socioeconomic factors, along with lack of competition between service providers in sparse population areas, the comparative cost of building telecommunications infrastructure in the bush, and the need for redundancy in rural and remote solutions. Finally, lower digital ability scores reflect social, cultural and material practices on farms that have produced distinctive orientations to technology. We conclude the article by explaining the contributions of the paper to digital inclusion research and by making recommendations for policy development.","[Marshall, Amber; Dezuanni, Michael; Burgess, Jean] Queensland Univ Technol, 149 Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia; [Thomas, Julian] RMIT Univ, 124 La Trobe St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Wilson, Chris K.] Swinburne Univ Technol, John St, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Swinburne University of Technology,"Marshall, A (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, Digital Media Res Ctr, Musk Ave, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia.",amber.marshall@qut.edu.au; m.dezuanni@qut.edu.au; je.burgess@qut.edu.au; julian.thomas@rmit.edu.au; cwilson@swin.edu.au,"Wilson, Chris K/L-6679-2016; Marshall, Amber/IST-0591-2023","Marshall, Amber/0000-0002-2354-4284; Burgess, Jean/0000-0002-4770-1627",RMIT University; Centre for Social Impact at Swinburne University of Technology; Telstra; Roy Morgan Research,RMIT University; Centre for Social Impact at Swinburne University of Technology; Telstra; Roy Morgan Research,"Funding for the research reported in this article was provided as part of the Australian Digital Inclusion Index, a collaborative research project between RMIT University, Centre for Social Impact at Swinburne University of Technology, Telstra and Roy Morgan Research.

In contrast, this paper draws upon the cultural political economy approach to argue that the move towards gig work is more accurately conceptualised as an attempt to legitimate the further flexibilisation of labour markets within advanced industrial democracies, seeking to construct economic imaginaries that are best described as a form of 'fictitious freedom'. In drawing on the cultural political economy approach, the paper explores the interaction between the structural, discursive and technological selectivities which have generated these outcomes. This is done through a discussion of the case of Japan, which is selected as a key case that highlights the tensions and pressures leading to the introduction of gig work in this way across the advanced industrial democracies. The article shows how gig work sees new digital technologies used in an attempt to increase productivity and thereby further growth, locking gig workers into low-skilled and low-paid super-fragmented tasks, whilst at the same time heralding the benefits that gig work can provide for a range of contemporary problems.","[Shibata, Saori] Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Area Studies, Matthias de Vrieshof 2,Room 2-02c, NL-2311 BZ Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC,"Shibata, S (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Leiden Inst Area Studies, Matthias de Vrieshof 2,Room 2-02c, NL-2311 BZ Leiden, Netherlands.",s.shibata@hum.leidenuniv.nl,"Shibata, Saori/HPH-0001-2023","Shibata, Saori/0000-0002-5944-9721",,,,,72,35,38,9,115,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Notwithstanding the potential broad cross-sectoral benefits, the natural environment, locality constraints, and incessant challenge of distance have impeded the balanced development of the bioeconomy. However, driven by digital solutions, the bioeconomy has taken big steps forward in recent years. Digitalization has enabled real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility, improved delivery accuracy as well as stock level optimization and alignment with demand planning. The advancement of e-commerce has also led to the elimination of distance between both the upstream and the downstream of the chain. This paper demonstrates a transformative stream observed at the forefront of the forest-based bioeconomy chain. An empirical analysis focusing on the core business activities at the forefront, both upstream and downstream of the chain, is conducted. A new insight common to all industries in the digital economy is thus explored for constructing a creative disruption platform by embracing digital solutions.","[Watanabe, Chihiro; Naveed, Nasir; Neittaanmaki, Pekka] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Watanabe, Chihiro] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria",University of Jyvaskyla; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Watanabe, C (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",watanabe.c.pqr@gmail.com,,,Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [293446],Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland,The research leading to these results has received funding from the Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland under grant agreement 293446 - Platform Value Now: Value capturing in the fast emerging platform ecosystems.,,60,35,36,6,102,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

The purpose of the study is to characterize the ICT sector in terms of, among other things, the skills needs in the sector for the purpose of powering the emerging digital economy. Moreover, the study - through review of literature - extends, to cover the status of ICT skills for the digital economy both in developed and developing countries. Design/methodology/approach - The study used qualitative design. Focus group discussions were used to collect data from key stakeholders in the ICT sector. The stakeholders included: ICT enterprises, Citizen Owned IT companies lobby group (CORBIT), Botswana Telecommunication Corporation, Botswana Power Corporation, business community, academia, and legal experts. Data collected were analyzed using thematic categorization. Results were presented using descriptive and narrative form. Findings - The findings generally suggest that there is an acute global shortage of high skilled and hands-on personnel necessary for steering the emerging digital economy in both developed and developing countries including Botswana. In addition, there is a serious skills gap for certified specialists to help develop the sophisticated applications necessary to power the digital economy and more so the applications that depend on it. Research limitations/implications - The empirical part of the study was limited to the ICT sector of the economy in Botswana. A similar study covering all sectors of the national economy will provide a complete picture of ICT skills needs for the nation and its preparedness to partake in the emerging digital economy. Practical implications - ICT, particularly the internet, is having a significant impact on the operations of business enterprises and is claimed to be essential for the survival and growth of nations' economies. Botswana Govenment has realized the folly of depending largely on diamond mining for long-term Emerald economic development. Consequently, it is encouraging the development of the ICT sector as a way to diversify its economy and position itself to play a leading role in the global emerging digital economy. Originality/value - This study provides a framework for ICT skills development strategies that can enable countries to participate competitively in the emerging digital economy.","Univ Botswana, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Gabrone, Botswana; Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Fac Business Informat, Cape Town, South Africa; Univ Botswana, Dept Lib & Informat Studies, Gaborone, Botswana; Cape Peninsula Univ Technol, Fac Business Informat, Cape Town, South Africa",University of Botswana; Cape Peninsula University of Technology; University of Botswana; Cape Peninsula University of Technology,"Mutula, SM (corresponding author), Univ Botswana, Dept Lib & Informat Sci, Gabrone, Botswana.",mutulasm@mopipi.ub.bw,"Mutula, Stephen/N-4674-2013","Mutula, Stephen/0000-0003-3776-8104",,,,,42,35,48,1,52,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0737-8831,,,LIBR HI TECH,Libr.

Especially due to social media networks, consumers have been exposed to significant amounts of disinformation, misinformation and actual information. Electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) on social media networks has been facilitating swift information spread. Henceforth, it has become increasingly problematic for consumers to adopt authentic information and differentiate between marketers-generated content and user-generated content. The study aims to unfold the factors that lead to the information adoption that consequently motivates consumers to purchase products and services. The research study provides a comprehensive framework to re-configure factors that lead to consumers' purchase intentions in the digital economy. Respondents of the study were those individuals who have been buying products online.

Another digital divide?,JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,European Union; Digital divide; Digital transformation; National intellectual capital,PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; INNOVATION; BUSINESS,"Purpose This study, an exploratory one, aims to empirically investigate the association of national intellectual capital (NIC) with the national digital transformation readiness of the European Union's (EU's) member states. Apart from building the conceptual model of NIC, this study explores the role of NIC dimensions in the digital divide between European countries. Design/methodology/approach Based on the literature review and the available EU statistical data and indexes, the theoretical framework and conceptual model for NIC were developed. The model explores the relation of NIC and its dimensions (human, social, structural, relational and renewable/development capital) on the readiness of European countries for digital transformation and the digital divide. Significant differences between EU countries in NIC and digital readiness were tested. Multiple linear regression was used to explore the association of each NIC dimension with digital transformation and digital divide within the EU. Findings Despite a positive association between all dimensions of NIC and digital transformation readiness, the proposed model of NIC was not confirmed in full. Regression analysis proved social capital and working skills, a dimension of human capital, to be the predictors of digital transformation at a national level, able to detect certain elements of digital divide between EU member states. Structural capital, knowledge and education, as dimensions of human capital, were predictors of the digital divide in terms of the integration of digital media in companies. Research limitations/implications This research has a limited propensity for generalisation due to the lack of common measurement models in the field of NIC exploration. Practical implications This research offers policy makers an indication of the relationships between NIC and digital transformation, pointing out which dimensions of NIC should be strengthened to allow the EU to meet the challenges of digital economy and to overcome the digital divide between EU member states. Social implications The use of digital technologies is key in creating active and informed citizens in the public sphere and productive companies and economic growth in the business sphere. Originality/value This study provides an original theoretical framework and conceptual model through which to analyse the relationship between NIC and digital transformation, which has thus far not been explored at the level of the EU.

Findings As a distributive digital ledger, blockchains have the potential to create a more inclusive tourism future to address debates around tourism as a vehicle for sustainable development that alludes to value accruing to only certain providers and consumers. Blockchains and their cryptocurrencies (as a financial transaction capability) elevate trust and relational capabilities in an expedited and holistic manner, democratize participation in economic systems and re-distribute power and economic relations amongst actors by influencing the way data (the currency of the digital economy and the lifeblood of tourism) is collected, stored, exchange, owned and traded for co-creating value. Originality/value The paper contributes to the emerging but controversial literature about the trajectories between technology and sustainability by critically debating on how blockchains, through cryptocurrency economies, can be positioned to facilitate sustainable tourism futures.","[Tham, Aaron] Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Business, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia; [Sigala, Marianna] Univ South Australia, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of South Australia,"Tham, A (corresponding author), Univ Sunshine Coast, Fac Business, Sippy Downs, Qld, Australia.",mtham@usc.edu.au; marianna.sigala@unisa.edu.au,"Tham, Aaron/AFM-5968-2022; Sigala, Marianna/JZD-8032-2024","Tham, Aaron/0000-0003-1408-392X; Sigala, Marianna/0000-0001-8997-2292",,,,,116,34,35,9,82,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1757-9880,1757-9899,,J HOSP TOUR TECHNOL,J.

Developing this argument, we investigate the five principal dimensions of the European Commission's Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) using a series of multivariate statistics. The analysis can be divided into three groups. First, we analyse the linear relationships between dimensions by correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, and principal component analysis. In the partial correlation analysis, causal relationships between the dimensions show high correlations. Second, we assign countries into groups with cluster analysis and multi-dimensional scaling. The groups obtained by the two methods are very similar. Finally, we rank the European Union (EU) countries using statistical methods and compare with the results obtained with the overall DESI index. The correlation between the two rankings shows a strong linear relationship. Based on these results we draw conclusions on how to effectively use the DESI data for public policy analysis.","[Banhidi, Zoltan; Dobos, Imre; Nemeslaki, Andras] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Bánhidi, Z (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",banhidiz@kgt.bme.hu; dobos@kgt.bme.hu; nemeslaki@finance.bme.hu,"Banhidi, Zoltan/H-4550-2012; Dobos, Imre/A-5180-2013","Dobos, Imre/0000-0001-6248-2920; Banhidi, Zoltan/0000-0003-0262-5197",,,,,15,34,37,3,43,HUNGARIAN CENTRAL STATISTICAL OFFICE,BUDAPEST,"KELETI KAROLY STR 57, BUDAPEST, H-1024, HUNGARY",2063-9538,2064-8243,,REG STAT,Reg.

Because task demand is a major factor that influences how computerized systems are used to make decisions, identifying task demand automatically provides an opportunity for designing advanced decision support systems that can respond to user needs at a personalized level. A first step for designing such advanced decision tools is to investigate possibilities for developing automatic task load detectors. Grounded in decision making, eye tracking, and machine learning literature, we argue that task demand can be detected automatically, reliably, and unobtrusively using eye movements only. To investigate this possibility, we developed an eye tracking task load detection system and tested its effectiveness. Our results revealed that our task load detection system reliably predicted increased task demand from users' eye movement data.

Online, consumer skills are expected to be improved and the level of consumer awareness and engagement increased. These are the baseline prerequisites of the sustainable purchasing decision and, thus, should be considered as pillars of responsible online consumption. Consistent with the novel consumption challenges, the current paper is intended to advance and test a research model integrating five main constructs, namely, competition in the online marketplace, online consumer skills, online consumer awareness, online consumer engagement and sustainable purchasing decision. A total of 318 college students-a representative population of the new Millennials generation-accepted the invitation to participate in a questionnaire-based survey. In order to pertinently analyze the collected data, a structural equation modeling technique based on partial least squares was employed for the assessment of the measurement and the structural model. The findings indicated that the model explained 24.4 percent of the variance of sustainable purchasing decisions, while the highest influence was exerted by the improvement of online consumer skills. This implies that online providers should revisit their products sustainability standards on purpose to preserve a competitive advantage.","[Gazzola, Patrizia; Pezzetti, Roberta] Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Colombo, Gianluca] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Dept Management, USI, CH-6900 Lugano, Switzerland; [Nicolescu, Luminita] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Int Business & Econ, Bucharest 010374, Romania",University of Insubria; Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Gazzola, P (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dept Econ, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",patrizia.gazzola@uninsubria.it; gianluca.colombo@usi.ch; robertarita.pezzetti@uninsubria.it; luminita.nicolescu@rei.ase.ro,"Nicolescu, Luminita/G-9427-2018","Nicolescu, Luminita/0000-0001-8029-9054; Gazzola, Patrizia/0000-0003-2521-4892",,,,,83,34,36,17,129,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2017,9,5,,,,,,,693,10.3390/su9050693,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9050693,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY6XN,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000404127800018,View Full Record in Web of Science

This rivalry is subject to the application of competition law However, personal data also has a dignitary dimension which is protected through data protection law and EU Charter rights to data protection and privacy. This paper maps the relationship between these legal frameworks. It identifies the commonalities that facilitate their intersection, whilst acknowledging their distinct methods and aims. It argues that when the material scope of these legal frameworks overlap, competition law can incorporate data protection law as a normative yardstick when assessing non-price competition; data protection can thus act as an internal constraint on competition law In addition, it advocates that following the Lisbon Treaty, data protection and other fundamental rights also exercise an external constraint on competition law and, in certain circumstances, can prevent or shape its application. As national and supranational regulators grapple with the challenge of facilitating a dynamic information economy that respects fundamental rights, recognition of these constraints would pave the way for a more coherent EU law approach to the digital society.","[Costa-Cabral, Francisco] NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Lynskey, Orla] LSE Law Dept, London, England",New York University,"Costa-Cabral, F (corresponding author), NYU, Sch Law, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,"Costa-Cabral, Francisco/0000-0001-7838-1956",,,,,52,34,35,0,12,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",0165-0750,1875-8320,,COMMON MKT LAW REV,Common Mark.

From the coding of 150 news articles guided by Grounded Theory, this article focuses on the impact of the pandemic on influencers, and influencers' engagements with and reactions to the pandemic.

Creating feminist content in a digital environment thus requires the negotiation of individual self-branding and promotional activities alongside the advancement of collective feminist politics. In this study, interviews with 11 feminist online writers reveal that they reconcile the individualistic undertakings required to succeed in the digital economy and their collective feminist values in three ways. Firstly, they incorporate authentic feminism into their personal branding endeavors; secondly, they redefine feminism to more closely match the values of post-feminism; and, thirdly, they advance peripheral collective goals in their creative communities. It is through these strategies that feminist values are negotiated and reworked, enabling producers to succeed as feminists in a digital economy that is more closely aligned with post-feminism.","[Pruchniewska, Urszula M.] Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Pruchniewska, UM (corresponding author), Temple Univ, Klein Coll Media & Commun, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",Urszula.p@temple.edu,,,,,,,34,33,36,6,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1468-0777,1471-5902,,FEM MEDIA STUD,Fem.

During and after the crisis, there are opportunities and needs for remote work facilities, online services, delivery drones, etc. We discuss how unmanned technologies can cause a long-term employment decrease, and why compensation mechanisms may not work. Using the internationally comparable Frey-Osborne methodology, we estimated that less than a third of employees in Russia work in professions with a high automation probability. Some of these professions can suffer the most during quarantine measures; employment in traditional services can be significantly reduced. By 2030, about half of the jobs in the world and a little less in Russia will need to adapt during the fourth industrial revolution because they are engaged in routine, potentially automated activities. In the regions, specializing in manufacturing, this value is higher; the lowest risk is in the largest agglomerations with a high share of digital economy, greater and diverse labour markets. Accelerating technological change can lead to a long-term mismatch between the exponential increase in automation rate and compensating effects of retraining, new jobs creation and other labour market adaptation mechanisms. Some people will not be ready for a life-long learning and competition with robots, and accordingly there is a possibility of their technological exclusion. The term nescience economy and corresponding assessment method were proposed. Using an econometric model, we identified factors that reduce these risks: human capital concentration, favourable business climate, high quality of life and ICT development. Based on these factors, some recommendations for authorities were proposed in the conclusion.","[Zemtsov, Stepan] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Off 1700,Block 9,84 Vemadsky Prospekt, Moscow 11957, Russia; [Zemtsov, Stepan] Russian Foreign Trade Acad, Moscow, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; Russian Foreign Trade Academy,"Zemtsov, S (corresponding author), Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Off 1700,Block 9,84 Vemadsky Prospekt, Moscow 11957, Russia.",spzemtsov@gmail.com,"Buttree, Matthew/JSK-8811-2023; Zemtsov, Stepan P./F-6061-2013","Zemtsov, Stepan P./0000-0003-1283-0362",,,,,77,32,33,3,65,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1757-7802,,,REG SCI POLICY PRACT,Reg.

The blockchain technology can be used to build such a system, but current mainstream consensus protocols are vulnerable to attack, making blockchain systems unsustainable. In this paper, we propose a new Robust Proof of Stake (RPoS) consensus protocol, which uses the amount of coins to select miners and limits the maximum value of the coin age to effectively avoid coin age accumulation attack and Nothing-at-Stake (N@S) attack. Under a comparison framework, we show that the RPoS equals or outperforms Proof of Work (PoW) protocol and Proof of Stake (PoS) protocol in three dimensions: energy consumption, robustness, and transaction processing speed. To compare the three consensus protocols in terms of trade efficiency, we built an agent-based model and find that RPoS protocol has greater or similar trade request-satisfied ratio than PoW and PoS. Hence, we suggest that RPoS is very suitable for building a robust digital economy distributed system.","[Li, Aiya; Wei, Xianhua; He, Zhou] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [He, Zhou] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Big Data Min & Knowledge Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","He, Z (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;He, Z (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Big Data Min & Knowledge Management, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",liaiya17@mails.ucas.ac.cn; weixh@ucas.ac.cn; hezhou@ucas.ac.cn,"Wang, He/JCO-3900-2023; HE, Zhou/E-7898-2017","HE, Zhou/0000-0001-6288-7215","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71932002, 71932008, 71901202]; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71932002, 71932008, 71901202 and University of Chinese Academy of Sciences.",,42,32,34,2,26,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2824,10.3390/su12072824,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072824,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000531558100249,View Full Record in Web of Science

Science and technology studies, and work extending from Bruno Latour and Susan Leigh Star to governance-by-prototype and 'new materialism', have generated rich insights about infrastructure. These are being extended to 'infrastructure as regulation' (the infra-reg project).

The coupling of digitalization and bioeconomy is leading towards a digitalized bioeconomy that can satisfy the shift in consumers' preferences for eco-consciousness, which in turn induces coupling of up-down stream operation in the value chain. Thus, the co-evolution of the coupling of digitalization and bioeconomy and of upstream and downstream operations is transforming the forest-based bioeconomy into a digital platform industry. Aiming at addressing this transformation, a model was developed that explains above mentioned dynamism and demonstrated its reliability through an empirical analysis focusing on the development trajectory of UPM (forest-based ecosystem leader in Europe and a world pioneer in the circular economy) over the last quarter century, highlighting its efforts towards planned obsolescence-driven circular economy. It was comprehended that with the advancement of digital innovations, UPM has incorporated a self-propagating function that accelerates digital solution. Furthermore, this self-propagating function was triggered by coupling with a downstream leader, Amazon, in the United States. The dynamism in transforming a forest-based bioeconomy into a digital platform industry is thus clarified, and new insights common to all industries in the digital economy are provided.","[Watanabe, Chihiro; Naveed, Nasir; Neittaanmaki, Pekka] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Watanabe, Chihiro] IIASA, Laxenburg, Austria",University of Jyvaskyla; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Watanabe, C (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",watanabe.c.pqr@gmail.com; nn.ghumman@gmail.com; pekka.neittaanmaki@jyu.fi,,,Strategic Research Council of the Academy of Finland [293446]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [293446] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Strategic Research Council of the Academy of Finland; Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),The present research study received funding from the Strategic Research Council of the Academy of Finland under grant agreement 293446 for project 'Platform Value Now: Value capturing in the rapidly emerging platform ecosystems'.,,63,32,33,6,86,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

This sharply increases the risks of digital transformation. At the same time, certain regions and cities differ greatly in their ability to adapt to future changes. In this article, we seek to determine the capabilities of Russian regions to reduce risks and adapt to digital transformation. The literature stipulates that there are several factors able to reduce these risks. First of all, they are associated with retraining, ICT and STEAM-technologies' development, the promotion of economic activities that are less subject to automation. As a result of econometric calculations, we identified several factors that contribute to the new industries' development (in our case, ICT development), and, accordingly, increase regional adaptivity. These factors include diversification, the concentration of human capital, favorable entrepreneurship conditions, the creative potential of residents, and the development of ICT infrastructure. We identified several regions with high social risks and low adaptivity, which are mainly the poorly developed regions of southern Russia, where entrepreneurial risks are high, STEAM specialists are not trained, shadow economy is large.

In explicating digital privacy practices in the home we find an abiding methodological concern amongst members to manage the potential 'attack surface' of the digital on everyday life occasioned by interaction in and with the networked world. We also find, as a feature of this methodological preoccupation, that privacy dissolves into a heterogeneous array of relationship management practices. Accordingly we propose that 'privacy' has little utility as a focus for design, and suggest instead that a more productive way forward would be to concentrate on supporting people's evident interest in managing their relationships in and with the networked world.","[Crabtree, Andy; Tolmie, Peter; Knight, Will] Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England",University of Nottingham,"Crabtree, A (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Jubilee Campus,Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",andy.crabtree@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Crabtree, Andrew/0000-0001-5553-6767; Tolmie, Peter/0000-0003-2548-2125","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M001636/1, EP/N028260/1]; EPSRC [EP/N028260/1, EP/N028260/2, EP/M001636/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N028260/2, EP/N028260/1, EP/M001636/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grants EP/M001636/1 and EP/N028260/1].

Moral sentiments-and especially what Adam Smith called the sense of propriety, the sense of merit and the sense of justice-play a productive role in organizing the extraction of economic value. Conversely, relative valuations in the economy (prices, for instance) can be thought of as moral engines that reward or sanction certain behaviors, and are presumed to index underlying moral differences. Economic value is produced both when individuals are morally aligned with the rational goals of capitalism, and when they perform unhinged deviations from the moral standard. I show how modern digital capitalism organizes profit extraction through these twin processes of alignment and unhingement, building new economic moralities in the process-moral sentiments that are the result of people's interactions with opaque but powerful forms of behavioral fine-tuning, surveillance and manipulation.","[Fourcade, Marion] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fourcade, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",marion.fourcade@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,32,37,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Design/methodology/approach The study is based on an online survey among a panel of young American adults (N = 968). Findings The study finds a positive effect of materialism on personal well-being and negative effects on financial satisfaction, proactive financial coping and reduced consumption, but no effect on green buying, a separate and distinct pro-environmental strategy. Both proactive financial coping and reduced consumption are positively associated with subjective well-being. Research limitations/implications - Future research should re-examine conceptualizations of materialism in the context of climate change and the meaning of possessions in the global digital economy; studies could also focus on the specific well-being effects of reduced consumption and alternative pathways to align materialistic and environmental values. Practical implications - Consumer education should look to models of financial education to demonstrate how limited natural resources can be managed at the micro level to enhance consumers' subjective well-being, as well as reduce resource strain at the macro level. Originality/value Key contributions are the examination of materialism and consumption in the dual contexts of financial and environmental resource constraints and the effects of these key macro-social phenomena on consumers' perceived well-being. Another study highlight is the differentiation of two strategies for proactive environmental coping, of which only one, reduced consumption, increased personal well-being and decreased psychological distress.","[Helm, Sabrina] Univ Arizona, Retailing & Consumer Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA; [Serido, Joyce] Univ Minnesota, Family Social Sci, Minneapolis, MN USA; [Ahn, Sun Young] Washington Coll, Chestertown, MD USA; [Ligon, Victoria] Univ Arizona, Tucson, AZ USA; [Shim, Soyeon] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI USA",University of Arizona; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Washington College; University of Arizona; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Helm, S (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Retailing & Consumer Sci, Tucson, AZ 85721 USA.",helm@email.arizona.edu,,,,,,,102,31,32,3,39,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1758-7212,1747-3616,,YOUNG CONSUM,Young Consum.,NOV 15,2019,20,4,,,SI,,264,284,,10.1108/YC-10-2018-0867,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/YC-10-2018-0867,,,21,Business,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,JO4CF,,"Bronze, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000497526800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

We then evaluate the status quo of digital trade development in 111 countries and Chinese provinces by building a digital trade index system to determine the development environment and market potential. The results show that all countries attach great importance to digital technology, data and government guidance in the development of digital trade. The results also reveal that development, service and construction are the three most frequently used words in various Chinese documents. The overall level of China's digital trade is at the global vanguard, but is characterized by uneven regional development.

In the digital economy, organizations need to be competitive and differentiate them self through the knowledge they detained. This requires the adoption of innovative solutions that valorize and recognize workers who invest their time to keep up-to-date with areas of knowledge that are relevant to the organization. Indeed, organizations are investing in retaining skilled workers, in particular senior workers whose knowledge and experience are a valuable asset that should be passed to younger co-workers. One way to address these concerns is to create conditions to promote a feeling of employee's wellness in their work environment. In this paper, the two perception of well-being at the workplace (i.e. physical and social) are combined with gamification techniques and analyzed how it might help employees to acquire the expertise (soft and hard-skills) they need to improve their curriculum. This is particularly relevant for older adults to whom the feeling of fulfilment and recognition is much appreciated. The case study relates to the Active@Work project. The proposed solution incorporates an intelligent behavior to keep the user aware of their well-being status, triggering notifications to mitigate the risk of fatigue or stress at work. The solution also provides support for workers to engage in new and rewarding activities, where his/her knowledge and experience is considered as a relevant contribution, promoting in this way employee recognition and social well-being at the workplace. Team management and tutoring of younger co-workers by older adults will be, together with a Skill Development Tool, some of the innovative features within the project.","[Araujo, Jose] Univ Europeia, Laureate Int Univ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Pestana, Gabriel] INOV INESC Inovacao, Rua Alves Redol 9, P-1000029 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Europeia; Universidade de Lisboa; INOV INESC Inovacao,"Araújo, J (corresponding author), Univ Europeia, Laureate Int Univ, Lisbon, Portugal.",araujo.jca@gmail.com; gabriel.pestana@inov.pt,"Pestana, Gabriel/GLT-6854-2022","Pestana, Gabriel/0000-0001-6916-2575",,,,,17,31,35,6,109,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-4012,1873-4707,,INT J INFORM MANAGE,Int.

It finds that there are slight differences between women and men in the most basic and widespread skills, but they are very significant in the more complex and less generalized tasks. The disparities in this regard have generally decreased but very few points, so they are rather stable over the period. Additionally, those gender gaps are even more marked in the high-educated groups and also relevant among younger cohorts. Contrary to the statements made by the European Commission in its reports, these findings indicate that digital skills gaps by gender are still significant and likely to persist at many levels of society, while ICT specialist' profiles are becoming more important for future employment opportunities.","[Luis Martinez-Cantos, Jose] Univ Oberta Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain",UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya,"Martínez-Cantos, JL (corresponding author), Univ Oberta Catalunya, Internet Interdisciplinary Inst IN3, Av Carl Friedrich Gauss 5, Barcelona 08860, Spain.",jlmartinezcantos@gmail.com,"Martínez-Cantos, José-Luis/N-5576-2019; Martínez-Cantos, José Luis/M-2926-2017","Martínez-Cantos, José-Luis/0000-0001-8935-3993; Martínez-Cantos, José Luis/0000-0001-8935-3993",Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) postdoctoral fellowship,Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) postdoctoral fellowship,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The author carried out this research work with the support of a Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) postdoctoral fellowship.",,41,31,34,13,68,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0267-3231,1460-3705,,EUR J COMMUN,Eur.

Through the lens of online gaming guildsthe intermediary institutions between the industry and gamersthis article discusses how the Chinese information economy's dependence on consumer labor and the gamers' entrepreneurial resourcefulness have produced a secondary industry. As the secondary industry has evolved, the gaming industry has come to depend on the productive play of consumers. This changing regime of value has given rise to bio-political control of consumer labor and, along with state control, is drawing gamers into the tug-of-war between entrepreneurial invention and labor exploitation. By depicting the complex negotiations between capital and labor, and community and commerce, on both subjective and institutional levels, this article re-examines and explicates the Western debate over consumer digital cultural production and its social, economic, and political implications.","[Zhang, Lin] Univ So Calif, Annenberg Sch Commun, Los Angeles, CA 92262 USA; [Fung, Anthony Y.

At the same time, national jurisdictions no longer have the opportunity to ignore the fact of business working with crypto assets. Meanwhile, without consensus in the consistent resolution of financial, tax, and other cross-country relations, operations with crypto assets can belong to the underground economy sphere to a large extent. In this regard, the issues of regulating macroeconomic factors when reflecting crypto assets in the structure of the current classification, the procedure for their fair valuation, taking into account the formation of classification and content construction in the financial statements of companies, are relevant. Another aspect is to conduct comprehensive analysis in order to consider scientific and practical approaches to the procedure of classification and evaluation of cryptographic assets in scientific research, professional judgments of major audit international organizations. In this regard, the study focuses on a practical analysis of the current accounting policies of companies operating with crypto assets, taking into account the position of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC). Based on the results of the conducted research, the existing models of classification and evaluation of crypto assets are assessed, and the most problematic practical aspects of their application are highlighted. This made it possible to propose promising models for managing the value of crypto assets, containing the existing practices currently used by companies and their possible directions. It was concluded that the most promising way out of the conflict of interests of business and the current rules of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is to refine the existing standards, introduce rules of classification and evaluation of crypto assets. The authors also do not exclude that the best solution is to develop a new IFRS standard for the accounting of crypto assets.","[Morozova, Tatiana; Akhmadeev, Ravil] PRUE, Sfremyanny Lane 36, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Lehoux, Liubov] MIATI GL, CPA, Rue Andre De Garrini 4, CH-1217 Meyrin, Switzerland; [Lehoux, Liubov] RLG Europe BV, Swiss Branch, Rue Andre De Garrini 4, CH-1217 Meyrin, Switzerland; [Yumashev, Alexei] Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Trubetskaya St 8-2, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Meshkova, Galina] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, 2nd Baumanskaya St 5,P 1, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Lukiyanova, Marina] Financial Univ, Govt Russian Federat, Leningradsky Ave 49, Moscow 125993, Russia",Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation,"Akhmadeev, R (corresponding author), PRUE, Sfremyanny Lane 36, Moscow 117997, Russia.",ahm_rav@mail.ru,"Akhmadeev, Ravil/F-4984-2016; Morozova, Tatiana/K-3355-2018; Yumashev, Alexey/H-2630-2018","Akhmadeev, Ravil/0000-0002-7526-0144; Morozova, Tatiana/0000-0003-3833-2783; Yumashev, Alexey/0000-0002-5184-0195; Lehoux, Liubov/0000-0001-6081-5808",,,,,56,30,30,10,48,ENTERPRENEURSHIP & SUSTAINABILITY CENTER,VILNUS,"M K CIURLIONIO STR 86A, VILNUS, 03100, LITHUANIA",2345-0282,,,ENTREP SUSTAIN ISS,Entrepreneurship.

In so doing, it builds on and extends two currently dominant sets of critiques of the smart city: those that call into question its technocratic and top-down modes of governance, and those that describe the smart city as an empty signifier. The paper makes sense of the UK's variegated local smart urban practices by tracing the emergence of a national, state-led cultural economy of smart urbanism. Based on an analysis of smart-city programmes in 34 UK cities, we identify two broad discursive logics through which varieties of smart urbanism are produced and performed. First, the invocation of crisis forms a discursive foundation on which place-specific logics are based. Second, sets of what we term variegated logics are differently combined to build on the foundational story of crisis in the construction of local smart agendas. We discuss three of these variegated logics: the city portrayed as technological simulacrum; the focus on specific sectoral activities; and a chameleonic tendency to envelop previous eco-urban agendas into smart urbanism. By making these logics visible, the paper opens up a new critical space for debate about alternative future pathways that smart cities might take.","[Caprotti, Federico; Cowley, Robert] Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter,"Caprotti, F (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Dept Geog, Exeter, Devon, England.",f.caprotti@exeter.ac.uk,"Caprotti, Federico/AHB-0702-2022; Cowley, Robert/HTL-3722-2023","Caprotti, Federico/0000-0002-5280-1016; Cowley, Robert/0000-0002-5267-3974",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L015978/2]; ESRC [ES/L015978/2] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Economic and Social Research Council, (Grant/Award Number: ES/L015978/2).",,108,30,33,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-2754,1475-5661,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

Design/methodology/approach A review of literature on digital enterprise models led to the adaptation of a 16 business model archetype for analyzing digital enterprises in Ghana. Using a critical realism perspective, survey data from a sample of 91 digital enterprises were used for the study. Findings The findings suggest that among human, physical and intangible assets, financial assets were the least used assets in the operations of the digital enterprises. This stems from the fact that the online financial business sector is still in its nascent stages in most developing economies. The findings further suggest that all digital enterprises leverage on accessible and low-cost social networking services as part of their operations and use them as an avenue to engage with their target customers. Research limitations/implications - The findings from this study provide guidelines to entrepreneurs who wish to venture into the digital ecosystem of Ghana, particularly with regard to the economic, financial and technological factors that enable digital enterprises to survive in the competitive digital economy. Practical implications - The findings suggest that it is important for governments to realize that there is an increasing rise in digital enterprises in the developing economies and these enterprises are creating jobs and providing business solutions locally that would hitherto be sought from developed economies. There is therefore the need for the requisite legal infrastructure and financial support that will cushion these enterprises fromthe fierce competitions that stagnate their growth. Originality/value - The study provides a mapping of the digital business models of Ghanaian digital enterprises. This knowledge is arguably the first of its kind in the context of a developing economy. Hence, it serves as a stepping- stone for future studies to explore other areas in the digital economy, especially froma developing economy perspective.","[Ansong, Eric; Boateng, Richard] Univ Ghana, Business Sch, Dept Operat & MIS, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Boateng, R (corresponding author), Univ Ghana, Business Sch, Dept Operat & MIS, Accra, Ghana.",richboateng@ug.edu.gh,"Boateng, Richard/L-7776-2019; Ansong, Eric/ABI-6284-2020","Boateng, Richard/0000-0002-9995-3340; Ansong, Eric/0000-0002-0262-3485",,,,,53,30,34,5,99,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2398-5038,2398-5046,,DIGIT POLICY REGUL G,Digit.

Following Arlie Hochschild's work on emotional labour, I suggest normative youthful femininity is lived, not simply as a set of life regulations, but as a set of 'feeling rules' through which young women affectively manage such contradictions. Feeling rules shape how young women may feel in relation to gendered regulation, limiting their articulation of managing this burden to humorous, upbeat quips in the genre of safe, funny, 'girlfriendly' material. I examine a set of self-representative blogs authored by young women on the platform Tumblr to explore how these rules are navigated. Converting the frustrations of postfeminist regulation into funny, bite-sized moments, the blogs produce selves amenable to circulation in a gendered, digital economy of relatability.","[Kanai, Akane] Univ Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Kanai, A (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Univ Dr, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia.",akane.kanai@gmail.com,"Kanai, Akane/N-4194-2016","Kanai, Akane/0000-0002-5410-891X",,,,,60,30,36,1,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1367-5494,1460-3551,,EUR J CULT STUD,Eur.

However, contrary to such accomplishments, productivity in industrialized countries is now experiences an apparent decline.

Utilizing the results of empirical analyses of national, industrial, and individual behavior in the digital economy, solutions to these critical issues were investigated. Based on the two-faced nature of information and communication technology (ICT) and the fact that people's preferences extend beyond economic value, the concept of uncaptured GDP was postulated and spinoff dynamism to a new co-evolution among advancement of the Internet, increasing dependence on uncaptured GDP, and a shift in people's preferences was reviewed. This provided new insight and suggested a transformative direction to address the limitation of using GDP statistics in the digital economy.","[Watanabe, Chihiro; Neittaanmaki, Pekka] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Watanabe, Chihiro] IIASA, Vienna, Austria; [Tou, Yuji] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan",University of Jyvaskyla; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Tokyo Institute of Technology,"Watanabe, C (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",watanabe.c.pqr@gmail.com; tou.yuji@gmail.com; pekka.neittaanmaki@jyu.fi,,,Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [293446],Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland,"The research leading to these results is the part of a project: Platform Value Now: Value capturing in the fast emerging platform ecosystems, supported by the Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [grant number 293446].",,52,30,33,12,103,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

One way firms try to achieve this is to target firm communications to consumers who embrace and propagate the spread of new information on emerging and trending topics on social media. However, little is known about whether early trend propagators are indeed responsive to firm-sponsored messages. To explore whether early propagators of trending topics respond to advertising messages, we use data from two field tests conducted by a charity and an emerging fashion firm on the microblogging service Twitter. On Twitter, promoted tweets allow advertisers to target individuals based on the content of their recent postings. Twitter continuously identifies in real time which topics are newly popular among Twitter users. In the field tests, we collaborated with a charity and a fashion firm to target ads at consumers who embraced a Twitter trend early in its life cycle by posting about it, and compared their behavior to that of consumers who posted about the same topic later on. Throughout both field tests, we consistently find that early propagators of trends are less responsive to advertising than consumers who embrace trends later.","[Lambrecht, Anja] London Business Sch, London NW1 4SA, England; [Tucker, Catherine] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Wiertz, Caroline] City Univ London, Cass Business Sch, London EC1Y 8TZ, England",University of London; London Business School; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); City University London,"Lambrecht, A (corresponding author), London Business Sch, London NW1 4SA, England.",alambrecht@london.edu; cetucker@mit.edu; c.wiertz@city.ac.uk,"Tucker, Catherine E/H-4878-2011; Lambrecht, Anja/C-6300-2014",,Marketing Science Institute; Deloitte Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at London Business School,Marketing Science Institute; Deloitte Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at London Business School,This work was supported in part by the Marketing Science Institute and the Deloitte Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship at London Business School.,,60,30,36,7,162,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",0732-2399,1526-548X,,MARKET SCI,Mark.

The focus is on both subjective and objective measures related to the level of consumer awareness and action in a fast-growing competition, potentiated by the digital economy. In order to investigate the relations between the aforementioned concepts, a questionnaire-based survey was conducted, using a sample of 257 students from three top Romanian universities. Based upon the theoretical directions presented in the literature review, a conceptual model was elaborated and tested by employing a partial least squares structural equation modeling technique. As the examination of the structural model indicated, online purchasing decision-making is indirectly influenced by the high competition in the digital economy, by means of consumer protection awareness and consumer protection behavior. At this level, the analyzed factors, namely the competition in the digital economy, the consumer protection awareness and the consumer behavior with respect to the consumer protection policies, explain over 16% in the variance of the online purchasing decision-making.","[Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina; Mitan, Andreea] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania; [Nistoreanu, Bogdan Gabriel] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Vatamanescu, EM (corresponding author), Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania.",madalina.vatamanescu@yahoo.com,"Nistoreanu, Bogdan - Gabriel/AFW-4556-2022; Nistoreanu, Bogdan Gabriel/H-8566-2013; Puiu, Nistoreanu/C-1021-2009; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/F-4872-2017; Mitan, Andreea/AAP-8450-2021","Nistoreanu, Bogdan - Gabriel/0000-0003-0079-9150; Puiu, Nistoreanu/0000-0002-8369-7899;",,,,,36,30,33,6,50,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,MAY,2017,19,45,,,,,354,366,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EZ2EY,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000404523800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The sociological perspective on proposed data regulation recognises the reflexive relationship between law and the social order, and the commensurate needs to balance the demand for compliance with the design of computational tools that enable this new economic actor.

Researchers and policymakers thus need a clear picture of digital businesses, but conventional datasets and typologies tend to lag real-world change. We use innovative 'big data' resources to perform an alternative analysis for all active companies in the UK, focusing on ICT-producing firms. Exploiting a combination of observed and modelled variables, we develop a novel 'sector-product' approach and use text mining to provide further detail on key sector-product cells. We find that the ICT production space is around 42% larger than SIC-based estimates, with around 70,000 more companies. We also find ICT employment shares over double the conventional estimates, although this result is more speculative. Our findings are robust to various scope, selection and sample construction challenges. We use our experiences to reflect on the broader pros and cons of frontier data use. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the Internet has become part of the critical infrastructure and has a strategic importance in our society and in the digital economy. These developments have led to a highly dynamic network utilization, where traffic fluctuations and seemingly random and anomalous traffic patterns are commonly manifested and hard to diagnose. In order to ensure the protection and resilience of such networks, it is necessary to better analyze and observe network traffic. Thus, anomaly diagnosis aims to discover and characterize critical anomalies affecting the network infrastructure, where the source of these anomalies may be deliberately malicious (e.g. attacks) or unintentional (e.g. failures, misconfigurations or legitimate but abnormal use of the network such as in flash crowds). However, although there is a multitude of algorithms and techniques looking at different elements of the analysis of network traffic anomalies, most research typically focuses on a specific aspect or methodology and there is very little regard for the overall context. This survey aims to present a comprehensive investigation of the current state of the art within the network anomaly diagnosis domain, in particular for Internet backbone networks. We decompose the overall anomaly diagnosis problem spectrum into four main dimensions, namely, processing costs, diagnosis granularity, theoretical methodologies and traffic features. Subsequently the anomaly diagnosis research area is structured further and an overview of the most relevant research is provided by individually reviewing each component of the problem spectrum and proposed solutions with a deeper focus on methodologies and features. Further, we also present and review seminal pieces of work that are considered cornerstones of the anomaly diagnosis research domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Marnerides, A.

Virtual communities, or groups of people informally bound together by shared expertise, synthesise this Internet evolution and the Web 2.0 technology. Users increasingly want to engage online with one another and with organisations of all kinds. These novel Internet-based technologies dominate the new business models of the digital economy giving companies radical new ways to harvest the talents of innovators working outside corporate boundaries. One of the most illustrative examples of this new trend is the Open Source Software (OSS) projects development. This paper aims to analyse the structure and topology of the virtual community supporting one of the most successfully OSS projects, Linux. The objective is to provide conclusions for being successful in the development of future virtual communities. As companies learn to manage these virtual communities, they will develop smarter and faster ways to create value through them. Design/methodology/approach - The interactions of the virtual community members of an ARM-embedded Linux project website is analysed through social network analysis techniques. The participants' activity is studied and some conclusions about the participation features are obtained using the Gini coefficient. In particular, a participation inequality behaviour or a concentration on a small number of developers is clearly observed. Findings - The paper deals with the guidelines that virtual communities should follow to be successful. Results about the structure of a successful virtual community and its time evolution are provided to determine the mentioned guidelines. Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to a particular virtual community engaged with the development of the ARM-embedded Linux OSS. Other successful virtual communities can be analysed, and the conclusions could be compared. Anyway, the proposed analysis methodology can be extended to other virtual communities. Originality/value - The paper fulfils the development and features of Internet virtual communities to be successful. Results have important implications over the development of new software business models based on virtual communities and open source software. Contributions about the best organisation of virtual communities leading to a successful development of the underlying project are presented.","[Martinez-Torres, M. R.; Toral, S.

Yet, digital confidentiality has received vastly less research attention from operations and supply chain management (OSCM) scholars than cost, quality, flexibility, delivery, and innovation. We contend that this lack of attention has, at least partly, produced recommendations that ultimately could harm digital confidentiality performance. To guide future research, we synthesize relevant gaps across the OSCM and information systems literatures and discuss relevant OSCM research opportunities. Many of these opportunities are articulated as propositions. We also discuss contemporary industry practices aimed at upholding digital confidentiality. We call for the OSCM community to consistently and explicitly examine digital confidentiality as a performance dimension, and argue that failure to heed this call will be detrimental to our field's influence and relevance as digital assets continue to increase in value relative to physical ones.","[Massimino, Brett] Cornell Univ, 340 Statler Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Gray, John, V; Lan, Yingchao] Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, 2100 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Cornell University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Massimino, B (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, 340 Statler Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bjm272@cornell.edu; gray.402@osu.edu; lan.63@osu.edu,,"Gray, John/0000-0002-0212-5654",,,,,238,29,32,13,143,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1059-1478,1937-5956,,PROD OPER MANAG,Prod.

Commons-based peer production is presented as an alternative to the profit-driven peer-to-peer production models of the digital economy. The latter models utilize the peer-to-peer dynamics to harness social creativity, collaboration and information sharing. The created value is then captured and valorized towards profit maximization. This essay argues that there are possibilities for moving away from such extractive models to more generative ones. Commons-based peer production seems to encapsulate both social and environmental sustainability, and thus has the potential to influence such a transition. As commons-based peer production cannot yet reproduce itself outside of a mutual dependence on capitalism, it risks being subordinated. To counter this, a commons-oriented solid and protective ecosystem is needed to fully unleash the creative capabilities of commons-based peer production.","[Bauwens, Michel] P2P Fdn, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Pantazis, Alekos] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ragnar Nurkse Dept Innovat & Governance, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Pantazis, A (corresponding author), Tallinn Univ Technol, P2P Lab, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",alpant@ttu.ee,,"Pantazis, Alekos (Alexandros)/0000-0002-0904-4697",IUT [19-13]; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research,"IUT; Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)",We would like to thank La Fondation Charles Leopold Mayer (FPH) for its continued support of the P2P Foundation.

These disputes reveal the ongoing industrial struggles over journalists' copyrights, demonstrating tensions between the continuing control and devaluation of freelance labor to increase corporate profits as well as freelancers' use of digital communications to resist the law of copyright. Through an examination of these tensions, the broader political-economic context and labor process of freelance work, and freelance journalists' collective organizing, this paper develops a conception of the precarious e-lancer, a feminized and electronically connected class of journalists. The TC Media campaigns are situated within a broader history of freelancer struggles in North America and Western Europe. Since 1993, freelancers have adopted three refusal tactics: class-action lawsuits, contract boycotts, and strikes. Freelancers should not rely on these tactics and digital tools to facilitate them but rather use them, along with face-to-face and internal communications, to win the right to bargain collectively and address women's disadvantaged position in freelancing. This paper ultimately demonstrates the central role that journalistic workers have played in attempting to recompose precarity and democratize communication in the evolving digital economy.","[Salamon, Errol] McGill Univ, Dept Art Hist & Commun Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada",McGill University,"Salamon, E (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Art Hist & Commun Studies, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",errol.salamon@mail.mcgill.ca,"Salamon, Errol/ABB-9036-2020","Salamon, Errol/0000-0002-7335-5190",,,,,83,29,32,6,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2167-0811,2167-082X,,DIGIT JOURNAL,Digit.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the Internet are not equally spread around places and this heterogeneity affects spatial configuration. Despite the wide societal changes due to ICTs and the extensive interest in accessibility studies, these two themes have not yet come together in order to study the digital accessibility (DA) of places. Adopting an infrastructural perspective and a potential accessibility framework, a DA measure - embedding different types of impedance distance functions - is calculated for cities in Europe. Spatial Interaction Model and Complex Network Analysis are employed to calibrate and validate the DA results. The outcome of this approach is a new urban hierarchy which reveals a core-periphery pattern in Europe owing to digital accessibility. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

With a digital, open, networked approach we are witnessing a shift to abundance of content, and subsequently new economic models are being developed which have this as an assumption. In this article the role of scarcity in developing higher education practice and pedagogy is explored. The shift to abundant content has as profound implications for education as it has for content industries.

It also champions strategy-by-doing in entrepreneurial settings. This study juxtaposes and bridges these two perspectives to better understand product development. We propose that while a firm's product portfolio diversity contributes to new product success only to a certain degree, design iteration-a postlaunch strategy-by-doing approach-is positively associated with new product performance. Our core contribution points to a complementary relationship: strategy-by-doing helps mitigate the capacity constraints problem that prevents firms from successfully adapting product development capabilities to a dynamic market. Our analysis of a sample of 2,182 nascent mobile apps from 564 top producers in the U.S. market supports our hypotheses. We discuss implications for product development, strategy-by-doing, and technology innovation literature. Managerial Summary Successful product development establishes firms' competitive advantage. The burgeoning digital economy increasingly prompts product development to depend on strategy-by-doing and requires firms to adapt a product's design over its lifecycle. Through analyzing a sample of newly launched mobile apps in the U.S. market, we find that while a firm's product portfolio diversity improves new product success to a certain degree, design iteration, a distinct approach to strategy-by-doing, underpins a new product's continual attractiveness to users. Moreover, frequent design iterations can overcome the barriers that innovator firms face when applying a diverse repertoire of experiences to product development.","[Chen, Liang] Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, 198 Berkeley St, Parkville, Vic, Australia; [Wang, Mengmeng] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Business Sch, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Cui, Lin] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Management, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Li, Sali] Univ South Carolina, Darla Moore Sch Business, Int Business Dept, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of Melbourne; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Australian National University; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Chen, L (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Fac Business & Econ, 198 Berkeley St, Parkville, Vic, Australia.",liang.chen@unimelb.edu.au,"Wang, Mengmeng/ABG-8454-2021; Chen, Liang/G-2281-2011; Cui, Lin/A-3901-2009","Chen, Liang/0000-0002-9931-4039; Cui, Lin/0000-0002-9818-4543",University of Melbourne Early Career Researcher Grant [ECR0182020]; University of South Carolina Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER) grants,University of Melbourne Early Career Researcher Grant(University of Melbourne); University of South Carolina Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER) grants,"The authors appreciate the excellent guidance by Editor Chris Bingham and two anonymous reviewers.

Digital economy performance is a matter of national strategies for achieving economic growth and socioeconomic development. Widely accepted instruments for reporting progress in these areas have been recently developed, including the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI index). The current study aims to use the DESI index and its five dimensions (namely Connectivity, Human Capital, Use of Internet Services, Integration of Digital Technology and Digital Public Services) not only as a tool for recognizing the current state, but also to forecast progress under the Greek economic environment. The Gompertz model was used as a methodological tool and it is valuable that a diffusion model has been implemented on a composite index related to countries' digital competitiveness. Moreover, the results reveal the areas where convergencies and divergencies exist between Greece and the rest of the EU-28 member states, while forecast permits one to evaluate how current policies have a significant impact on digital competitiveness. Results indicate that Greece is facing significant challenges as a result of the low state of digitization, coming from both the demand side (businesses that consume internet services) and the offer side (institutional and governmental constraints). The proposed results could be used in order to readjust existing policies and to spot aspects where further improvement is needed to achieve high standards of digital competitiveness.","[Laitsou, Eleni; Kargas, Antonios; Varoutas, Dimitris] Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Athens 10672, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Varoutas, D (corresponding author), Natl & Kapodistrian Univ Athens, Dept Informat & Telecommun, Athens 10672, Greece.",elaitsou@di.uoa.gr; akargas@di.uoa.gr; d.varoutas@di.uoa.gr,"Kargas, Antonios/Q-4737-2018; Varoutas, Dimitris/D-5536-2013","Kargas, Antonios/0000-0001-6157-1761; Varoutas, Dimitris/0000-0002-9101-6221",,,,,81,28,28,4,40,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2227-7099,,ECONOMIES,Economies,DEC,2020,8,4,,,,,,,85,10.3390/economies8040085,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/economies8040085,,,33,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,PJ1DZ,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000601519100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its impact on accounting research is growing as the rise of the internet, mobile technologies and digital economy tools generate depth, breadth and variety of data that far exceed what researchers have had access to in the past. But whilst social scientists interested in organisational issues are starting to question conventional methodological approaches to the study of contexts where digital data forms are drawn upon, little such concern has been voiced in the management accounting literature. This paper seeks to explore the continued applicability of conventional methodological thinking when carrying out investigations within digital data environments to inform management accounting studies. It considers why digitalisation impacts methodological precepts, identifies how descriptive and explanatory modes of questioning which management accountants have conventionally opted for need rethinking, discusses ways in which digital data characteristics alter what can be drawn from empirical studies, and points to the potential offered within digitalised settings for methodological advance. It concludes by highlighting the necessity, where digitalisation exists, to question modes of posing questions and to reconsider the applicability of methodological precepts deployed by management accounting researchers to date.","[Bhimani, Alnoor] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bhimani, A (corresponding author), London Sch Econ, London, England.",a.bhimani@lse.ac.uk,,"Bhimani, Alnoor/0000-0002-1884-5840",,,,,98,28,31,9,59,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",2191-4761,2191-477X,,J MANAG CONTROL,J.

Despite this, there is a paucity of study into the role of OD for SMEs, in contrast to the growing literature that has focused on the collection and sharing of OD by the public sector. As such, our study contributes to open innovation research by analysing the main capabilities needed to overcome existing barriers to successfully manage OD in SMEs. Building upon the recent SME-oriented OI literature and adopting an interpretative absorptive capacity framework, we analyse the data collected from 30 semi-structured interviews with experts working in UK organisations adopting OD-based OI strategies. We find a number of core factors that shape OD acquisition, assimilation, transformation and exploitation by SMEs. Results show that without the specific OD capabilities identified in our study, it will be difficult for SMEs to successfully use OD, which may explain why the uptake of OD by SMEs more broadly has so far been limited. These unique OD capabilities need to be better developed by OD using SMEs, if this 'raw material' for the digital economy is to be fully exploited.","[Huber, Franz] Seeburg Castle Univ, Fac Management, Seeburgstr 8, A-5201 Seekirchen, Austria; [Wainwright, Thomas] Royal Holloway Univ London, Sch Management, Egham, Surrey, England; [Rentocchini, Francesco] Univ Milan, Dept Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy; [Rentocchini, Francesco] Univ Southampton, Southampton Business Sch, 12 Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; University of Milan; University of Southampton; Solent University,"Huber, F (corresponding author), Seeburg Castle Univ, Fac Management, Seeburgstr 8, A-5201 Seekirchen, Austria.",franz.huber@uni-seeburg.at; tom.wainwright@rhul.ac.uk; francesco.rentocchini@unimi.it,"Rentocchini, Francesco/A-5399-2009","Rentocchini, Francesco/0000-0002-6414-0577; Wainwright, Thomas/0009-0003-5415-4558",,,,,66,28,32,26,157,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0033-6807,1467-9310,,R&D MANAGE,R D Manage.,JAN,2020,50,1,,,SI,,31,46,,10.1111/radm.12347,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/radm.12347,,,16,Business; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,KF8OS,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000509497000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Sustainable Development Goals now offer an opportunity to re-examine this complex relationship in a globalized world. Drawing on major research evidence and key debates, this review article proposes a framework of mobility equity as part of SDG 10, which foresees the reduction of inequalities within and among countries by 2030. The main question addressed is how forms of social, human and digital mobility, including migration, can contribute to reduced inequalities and positive development outcomes. The reviewed research underpins the need for an approach that prioritizes equality of opportunity over equality of outcomes. Mobility equity offers such an approach and rests on two main foundations: people's equal capacity and freedom to be mobile in empowering ways, and the equal and inclusive regulation of mobility in all its forms, including human, social and digital mobility. The approach goes beyond income inequality and migrants' remittances to incorporate the differential mobility capacities among people in different contexts. This includes categorically excluded groups such as refugees, racialized minorities, and lower castes, but also tens of millions of workers in the global digital economy. As part of a special issue on new SDG Perspectives, the article provides new ideas for thinking about research and policy-making within the wider inequality-mobility nexus of global development.

It is characterized by three distinctive attributes: it is global, it favors intangible things-ideas, information, knowledge, relationships, and it is intensely inter-linked. As more and more organizations prepare to go digital, only few of them really seem to recognize what implications this transition will have on their business processes and on the organization as a whole. The transformation involves much more than setting up a digital infrastructure and requires even more than the ability to enter into a virtual collaboration with other partners. Organizations need to become smart, i.e. knowledge driven, internetworked, dynamically adaptive to new organizational forms and practices, learning as well as agile in their ability to create and exploit the opportunities offered by the digital economy. The article considers technologies and trends towards inter-operable tools for organizational agility and flexibility based on distributed business operations. The European Commission has been supporting these developments through its various research programmes since the early 1980s. Besides the notable research and technological development (RTD) achievements, important progress has also been made in the area of standardization and through consensus building between the research and business communities in Europe. It is further recognised that technology alone will not be able to sustain the creative potential of the digital economy if the socio-economic, the legal and regulatory frameworks are not adequately taken into account.","Commiss European Communities, Informat Soc Directorate Gen C, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; RoundRose Associates Ltd, B-1040 Brussels, Belgium",,"Filos, E (corresponding author), Commiss European Communities, Informat Soc Directorate Gen C, Rue de la Loi 200, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",,"Wernicke, Laurenz/K-2714-2017",,,,,,34,28,31,2,20,KLUWER ACADEMIC PUBL,DORDRECHT,"SPUIBOULEVARD 50, PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0956-5515,,,J INTELL MANUF,J.

Due to the recent disturbance in the financial sector in the country, there is an urgent need for financial service providers to adopt relevant technologies to help reduce operational inefficiencies and maintain service quality. This article analyses the implications of the digital economy for enhancing the efficiency of financial markets. Drawing the existing literature, it concludes that the financial institutions in the country have quite embraced and integrated digitisation into their activities. Given the perceived high level of digital illiteracy among the populace, it was surprising to discover the number of people who have signed on unto such financial products. It was recommended financial institutions integrate their operations with the necessary digital technologies as it helps reduce operational costs. Furthermore, they need to invest in digital infrastructure and skills of their staff to embrace technology in service delivery. It is also suggested that policymakers strengthen the laws, policies, and regulations such as data protection and cybercrime to enable the players of the market to operate freely and confidently.","[Agyapong, Daniel] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Finance, Cape Coast, Ghana",University of Cape Coast,"Agyapong, D (corresponding author), Univ Cape Coast, Dept Finance, Cape Coast, Ghana.",dagyapong@ucc.edu.gh,"Agyapong, Daniel/N-6054-2017","Agyapong, Daniel/0000-0002-5467-4356",,,,,68,27,28,2,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1918-6444,1925-2099,,TRANSNATL CORP REV,Transnatl.

An econometric and growth account combined model was developed to estimate the explanatory variables. The involved coefficients have been estimated to cast reservation on growth account approach results produced that ignored variables' parameter estimation that reveals the consistency of the results produced in the first step. On the other hand, in the second step, the modified model calculates productivity indicators ignored by econometric approach studies. The doubt on the results generated by both approaches has been overcame via developing the combined models into two steps growth accounting approach that provides parametric solutions and econometric approach gap that has been filled in the second step that calculates productivity indicators. The most significant contribution of this study is treating ICT cybersecurity's negative externality spillover effects similar to the negative externalities generated by pollutants' emissions and developing capital productivity framework and model that were unnoticed in most of the studies.","[Ahmed, Elsadig Musa] Multimedia Univ, Econ Unit, Fac Business, Melaka 75450, Malaysia",Multimedia University,"Ahmed, EM (corresponding author), Multimedia Univ, Econ Unit, Fac Business, Melaka 75450, Malaysia.",elsadig1965@gmail.com,"Ahmed, Elsadig Musa/N-6539-2018","Ahmed, Elsadig Musa/0000-0002-1485-9452",,,,,53,27,28,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1868-7865,1868-7873,,J KNOWL ECON,J.

The digital transformation of firms requires leadership that can promote the adaptive quality of organizational culture. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted an empirical study using two key informants from a sample of 181 incumbent firms. Findings - The authors find significant evidence that adaptive culture is the vehicle by which transformational leaders positively influence e-business adoption. Originality/value - Given the digital economy's external pressures, many e-business adoption processes fail due to organizational factors originating in leadership and its capability to change followers' values, norms, and motivations. To solve this problem, the authors propose a model that explains how transformational leadership first plays a key role in changing characteristics of culture and then facilitates e- business adoption.","[Alos-Simo, Lirios; Verdu-Jover, Antonio J.; Gomez-Gras, Jose-Maria] Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Dept Econ & Financial Studies, Elche, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche,"Verdu-Jover, AJ (corresponding author), Univ Miguel Hernandez Elche, Dept Econ & Financial Studies, Elche, Spain.",ajverdu@umh.es,"Verdu-Jover, Antonio/C-8376-2012; Alos-Simo, Lirios/ABG-6822-2020; Gómez-Gras, José-María/AAA-5285-2019","Verdu-Jover, Antonio/0000-0002-6201-7196; Alos-Simo, Lirios/0000-0001-6949-7973;","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2010-21276, ECO2013-45885-R]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),The authors thank the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation for partial financing of this research through projects ECO2010-21276 and ECO2013-45885-R.,,109,27,37,9,144,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0263-5577,1758-5783,,IND MANAGE DATA SYST,Ind.

Drawing on interviews with net idols and an analysis of the digital infrastructure that evolved around the trend, the essay offers three arguments. First, it claims that the digital economy has adopted a particular mode of accumulation-the social factory-that has expanded sources of value extraction by blurring the boundaries between paid/productive and unpaid/reproductive labor. Second, this essay conceptualizes the net idols' production of cute culture as emotional labor and claims that the digital media economy has effectively expanded the practices through which value is extracted from women's unwaged labor far beyond the domestic sphere. Third, it demonstrates that young women did not uncritically embrace this logic. Rather, they insisted on using digital media to gain leverage in the labor market and improve their chances for upward social mobility. The essay concludes that, resonant with the ways in which women's unwaged labor in the home was instrumental to maintaining the socioeconomic order of the high-growth period, women's unpaid emotional labor remains central to a society in which labor precarity generates a demand for emotional labor. At the same time, by promoting to young people digital media as tools they can utilize to develop new skills, the digital economy makes the idea of unpaid labor more acceptable by repositioning it as a prerequisite to attain lucrative and meaningful work.","Univ Pittsburgh, Anthropol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Lukacs, G (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Anthropol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,39,27,32,3,56,DUKE UNIV PRESS,DURHAM,"905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA",1067-9847,1527-8271,,POSITIONS-ASIA CRIT,Positions-Asia Crit.,AUG,2015,23,3,,,SI,,487,513,,10.1215/10679847-3125863,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/10679847-3125863,,,27,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,CT7OK,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000363004200005,View Full Record in Web of Science

We begin with an analysis of the interactions between mobile, ubiquitous and immersive technologies and the wider context of the digital economy. In this analysis, we identify social, economic and educational developments that blur boundaries: between the individual and the consumer, between the formal and the informal, between education and other forms of learning. This leads to a complex array of possibilities for learning designs, and an equally complex array of ethical dimensions and challenges. We then examine the recent literature on the ethical dimensions of TEL research, and identify key trends, ethical dilemmas and issues for researchers investigating MUITEL in informal educational settings. We then present a summary of research dialogue between the authors (as TEL researchers) to illuminate these MUITEL research challenges, indicating new trends in ethical procedure that may offer inspiration for other researchers. We conclude with an outline, derived from the foregoing analysis, of ways in which ethical guidelines and processes can be developed by researchers - through interacting with participants and other professionals. We conclude that ethical issues need to remain as open questions and be revisited as part of research practices. Because technologies and relationships develop, reassessments will always be required in the light of new understandings. We hope this analysis will motivate and support continued reflection and discussion about how to conduct ethically committed MUITEL research.","[Lally, Vic] Univ Glasgow, Sch Educ, Glasgow G3 6NH, Lanark, Scotland; [Sharples, Mike] Univ Nottingham, Sch Educ, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Tracy, Frances] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Fac Educ Community & Leisure, Liverpool L17 6BD, Merseyside, England; [Bertram, Neil] Univ Glasgow, MRC Social & Publ Hlth Sci Unit, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland; [Masters, Sherriden] Univ Nottingham, Learning Sci Res Inst, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England",University of Glasgow; University of Nottingham; Liverpool John Moores University; University of Glasgow; University of Nottingham,"Lally, V (corresponding author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Educ, St Andrews Bldg,11 Eldon St, Glasgow G3 6NH, Lanark, Scotland.",vic@viclally.eu,,"Tracy, Frances/0000-0003-1777-8081",ESRC [ES/F042116/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F042116/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,58,27,27,1,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1049-4820,,,INTERACT LEARN ENVIR,Interact.

In the digital economy, technology enabled learning or e-learning is becoming an integral part of a larger system of practices and policies designed to prepare and support a high skilled workforce. The power of e-learning comes from the opportunity to leverage technology and information to alter the basic tenets of learning by eliminating the one-size fits all approach to instruction and customizing content to meet individual needs and learning styles. Because e-learning has the potential to significantly improve workforce development, the American Society for Training and Development (ASTD) and the National Governors' Association (NGA) convened leaders from business, government, and education to examine how e-learning can equip workers with the skills needed to succeed.

Design/methodology/approach - In total, 52 papers were deemed to be relevant to the analysis. These works were critiqued using a framework that addressed geographical contexts, topics, methodologies and theoretical frameworks. Findings - This review highlights the uneven level of development of the academic debate between North America, the UK and continental Europe, and identifies the different theoretical frameworks that construe the body of literature in each region. In addition, the findings show the scant offer of work on the impact that the digital economy has on FE, as well as the reduced number of studies which have focused on certain vulnerable groups and the access to some financial services. Social implications - The studies reviewed have not analyzed the specific needs of vulnerable groups while considering the different contexts and pathways to exclusion. The evaluation of solutions and strategies to achieve inclusion is one of the least addressed aspects in the literature. Originality/value - The paper synthesizes the main contributions of the top literature on the redefinition of FI/FE in developed countries, the role of fringe services and new determinants of exclusion. The proliferation of studies regarding FI in low- and middle-income countries has generated a great amount of meta-analysis and systematized reviews of asymmetric results. However, no systematized literature review on the broad scope of FI/FE in developed countries has been published in the last decade. This work sheds light over poorly analyzed areas of research that refer to notable social problems.","[Fernandez-Olit, Beatriz] Univ Int la Rioja, Dept Business, Campus Logrono, Logrono, Spain; [Martin Martin, Jose Maria] Univ Int la Rioja, Dept Business Area, Fac Business & Commun, Campus Logrono, Logrono, Spain; [Porras Gonzalez, Eva] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Dept Fundamentals Econ Anal, Fac Jurid & Social Sci, Vicalvaro, Spain",Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR); Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR); Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Martín, JMM (corresponding author), Univ Int la Rioja, Dept Business Area, Fac Business & Commun, Campus Logrono, Logrono, Spain.",josemaria.martin@unir.net,"Martin Martin, Jose Maria/O-8111-2018; Fernández-Olit, Beatriz/F-6883-2016; Martin Martin, Jose Maria/O-8111-2018","Martin Martin, Jose Maria/0000-0002-5891-0037; Fernández-Olit, Beatriz/0000-0003-4567-9558; Martin Martin, Jose Maria/0000-0002-5639-2213",,,,,72,26,28,9,76,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0265-2323,1758-5937,,INT J BANK MARK,Int.

Among others, business analytics competences and information technology skills are considered a must have capability for the controlling and MA profession. As it still remains unclear if these requirements can be fulfilled by today's employees, the purpose of this study is to examine the supply of business analytics competences in the current competence profiles of controlling professionals in an attempt to answer the question whether or not a skills gap exists. Design/methodology/approach Based on a set of 2,331 member profiles of German controlling professionals extracted from the business social network XING, a text analytics approach is conducted to discover patterns out of the semi-structured data. In doing so, the second purpose of this study is to encourage researchers and practitioners to integrate and advance big data analytics as a method of inquiry into their research process. Findings Apart from the mediating role of gender, company size and other variables, the results indicate that the current competence profiles of the controller do not comply with the recent requirements towards business analytics competences. However, the answer to the question whether a skills gap exist must be made cautiously by taking into account the specific organizational context such as level of IT adoption or the degree of job specialization. Originality/value The insights provided in this study extend the ongoing debate in accounting literature and business media on the skills changes of the controlling and MA profession in the big data era. The originality of this study lies in its explicit attempt to integrate recent advances in data analytics to explore the self-reported competence supplies of controlling professionals based on a comprehensive set of semi-structured data. A theoretically founded explanatory model is proposed that integrates empirically validated findings from extant research across various disciplines.","[Oesterreich, Thuy Duong; Teuteberg, Frank] Osnabruck Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Osnabruck, Germany",University Osnabruck,"Oesterreich, TD (corresponding author), Osnabruck Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat Syst, Osnabruck, Germany.",toesterreich@uni-osnabrueck.de,"Teuteberg, Frank/HMV-5734-2023","Teuteberg, Frank/0000-0003-3870-6642; Oesterreich, Thuy Duong/0000-0002-2988-7165",,,,,90,26,27,7,59,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1832-5912,1839-5473,,J ACCOUNT ORGAN CHAN,J.

But like the old economy's carbon fuel, it also pollutes. Harmful data emissions are leaked into the digital ecosystem, disrupting social institutions and public interests. This article develops a novel framework-data pollution-to rethink the harms the data economy creates and the way they have to be regulated. It argues that social intervention should focus on the external harms from collection and misuse of personal data. The article challenges the hegemony of the prevailing view-that the injuries from digital data enterprise are exclusively private. That view has led lawmakers to focus solely on privacy protection as the regulatory objective. The article claims, instead, that a central problem in the digital economy has been largely ignored: how the information given by people affects others, and how it under mines and degrades public goods and interests. The data pollution concept offers a novel perspective why existing regulatory tools-torts, contracts, and disclosure law-are ineffective, mirroring their historical futility in curbing the harms from industrial pollution. The data pollution framework also opens up a rich roadmap for new regulatory devices-an environmental law for data protection-which focuses on controlling these external effects. The article examines how the tools used to control industrial pollution-production restrictions, carbon tax, and emissions liability-could be adapted to govern data pollution.","[Ben-Shahar, Omri] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Ben-Shahar, O (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",omri@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,153,26,29,3,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",2161-7201,1946-5319,,J LEGAL ANAL,J.

J,"Katz, R; Callorda, F",,,,"Katz, Raul; Callorda, Fernando",,,Accelerating the development of Latin American digital ecosystem and implications for broadband policy,TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In the past ten years the Latin American and Caribbean region has been advancing in terms of various digitization metrics, such as the deployment of broadband infrastructure, and the adoption of the Internet and social media. However, despite the significant progress in terms of digitization of consumption,' the region faces still some important development challenges of its digital economy. This paper attempts to identify what the future challenges are for Latin America and the Caribbean, which raises a number of research and policy questions: (1) How close is consumer digitization in Latin America and the Caribbean to the levels observed in industrialized countries? (2) How should Latin America and the Caribbean address the broadband and Internet demand gap of the non-adopting population? (3) Are current digitization trends homogeneous across countries in the region or do we observe a divergence across countries, indicating some advanced nations approaching industrialized country performance, while others lagging? (4) If infrastructure and consumer adoption of certain digital products and services is evolving at a fast pace, what are the upcoming digitization challenges? (5) If broadband is a critical lever for the development of digitization, what are the policies to be implemented by Latin American and Caribbean governments to maximize investment for deployment of last generation technologies and promote adoption? To answer these questions the authors have developed, with support of CAF Latin American Development Bank, a comprehensive digitization index. This new index is used to assess the development of Latin America and the Caribbean region vis-a-vis industrialized countries. On this basis, an econometric model is developed to measure the economic development impact of digitization. Zeroing in on broadband as a critical lever for the development of the digital economy, a set of infrastructure investment and adoption goals is defined for different countries in the region. Finally, public policies are recommended to achieving the established goals.","[Katz, Raul] Columbia Business Sch, Columbia Inst Teleinformat, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Callorda, Fernando] Univ San Andres, Econ Dept, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Columbia University; Universidad de San Andres Argentina,"Katz, R (corresponding author), Columbia Business Sch, Columbia Inst Teleinformat, New York, NY 10027 USA.",raul.katz@teleadvs.com; f.callorda@teleadvs.com,"Katz, Raul/HJH-8316-2023","Katz, Raul/0000-0001-7729-7891",,,,,21,26,28,4,40,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

A new financial industry in the form of financial technology (fintech) initiated the era of the digital economy. At the same time, inherent risks in technology-driven financial innovations, such as technical risks, information asymmetry, and even potential systemic risks, necessitate regulatory responses. However, insufficient regulatory techniques, outdated financial laws, and conservative regulatory concepts make it difficult for traditional regulations based on financial intermediaries to adapt to the current environment of decentralized financial transactions. Technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers' rights and interests. This new regulatory model aims to build a system that integrates equal access to information on blockchain transactions by both parties to it (i.e., the regulators and the financial institutions they regulate) for the purpose of oversight, intelligent real-time oversight, and an experimental sandbox for developing regulatory technology. This dynamic and flexible financial regulatory system could effectively address fintech risks.","[Yang, Dong] Renmin Univ China, Ctr Civil & Commercial Law, Law Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yang, Dong] Renmin Univ China, Law & Technol Inst, Law Sch, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Min] Peking Univ, Law Sch, Ctr Financial Law, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Min] Calif Univ, Berkeley Law Sch, Berkeley, CA USA",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China; Peking University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Li, M (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Sch Law, Boalt Hall 7200, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",emily1501111033@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,33,26,26,7,89,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

According to its proponents, in the knowledge economy, companies and countries alike would succeed by cultivating workers' knowledge - as opposed to traditional forms of capital such as plant and machinery. This had radical implications for public policy, implying that education reform and other supply-side interventions could deliver inclusivity as well as prosperity. Today, however, this benevolent vision of the social and economic impacts of technological progress has been superseded by an altogether more dystopian view, associated with automation and the rise of artificial intelligence, as well as transformations in the digital economy and the evolving nature of globalisation. This paper analyses that transition. It charts the key assumptions of the knowledge economy concept, through an intellectual history that focuses on how these ideas manifested themselves in the rhetoric of the UK Government under Tony Blair. It then shows how evolving understandings of the digital economy, technological progress and globalisation challenge these assumptions, and the policy agenda that was premised on them.","[O'Donovan, Nick] Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Future Econ Res Ctr, Dept Econ Policy & Int Business, Manchester, Lancs, England",Manchester Metropolitan University,"O'Donovan, N (corresponding author), Manchester Metropolitan Univ, Future Econ Res Ctr, Dept Econ Policy & Int Business, Manchester, Lancs, England.",n.odonovan@mmu.ac.uk,"O'Donovan, Nick/GVU-0972-2022","O'Donovan, Nick/0000-0002-0588-7734",,,,,92,25,33,8,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

J,"Determann, L",,,,"Determann, Lothar",,,No One Owns Data,HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; PRIVACY; INFORMATION; PROTECTION; INTERNET; RIGHTS; LAW,"Businesses, policy makers, and scholars are calling for property rights in data. They currently focus on the vast amounts of data generated by connected cars, industrial machines, artificial intelligence, toys and other devices on the Internet of Things (IoT). This data is personal to numerous parties who are associated with the connected device, and there are many others are also interested in this data. Various parties are actively staking their claims to data, as they are mining the fuel of the digital economy. Stakeholders in digital markets often frame claims, negotiations and controversies regarding data access as one of ownership. Businesses regularly assert and demand that they own data. Individual data subjects also assume that they own data about themselves. Policy makers and scholars focus on how to redistribute ownership rights to data. Yet, upon closer review, it is very questionable whether data is-or should be-subject to any property rights. This Article unambiguously answers the question in the negative, both with respect to existing law and future lawmaking in the United States and the European Union, jurisdictions with notably divergent attitudes to privacy, property and individual freedoms. Data as such, that is, the content of information, exists conceptually separate from works of authorship and databases (which can be subject to intellectual property rights), physical embodiments of information (data on a computer chip, which can be subject to personal property rights) and physical objects or intangible items to which information relates (a dangerous malfunctioning vehicle to which the warnings on road markings or a computer chip relate). Lawmakers have granted property rights to different persons regarding works of authorship, databases, land, and chattels to incentivize investments and improvements in such items. However, this purpose does not exist with respect to data. Individual persons, businesses, governments and the public at large have different interests in data and access restrictions. These interests are protected by an intricate net of existing laws, which deliberately refrain from granting property rights in data. Indeed, new property rights in data are not suited to promote better privacy or more innovation or technological advances, but would more likely suffocate free speech, information freedom, science and technological progress. The rationales for propertizing data are thus not compelling and are outweighed by the rationales for keeping the data open. No new property rights need to be created for data.","[Determann, Lothar] Free Univ Berlin, Comp Internet & Data Privacy Law, Berlin, Germany; [Determann, Lothar] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Sch Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Determann, Lothar] Hastings Coll Law, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA; [Determann, Lothar] Baker McKenzie LLP, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA",Free University of Berlin; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Determann, L (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Comp Internet & Data Privacy Law, Berlin, Germany.;Determann, L (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley Sch Law, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Determann, L (corresponding author), Hastings Coll Law, San Francisco, CA 94102 USA.;Determann, L (corresponding author), Baker McKenzie LLP, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA.",,"TATUM, CARLOS/AAC-6054-2019","TATUM, CARLOS/0000-0001-6822-3217",,,,,175,25,26,10,51,UNIV CALIF,SAN FRANCISCO,"HASTINGS COLLEGE LAW 200 MCALLISTER ST, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94102 USA",0017-8322,,,HASTINGS LAW J,Hastings Law J.,DEC,2018,70,1,,,,,1,43,,,,,,43,Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law,HG7ZW,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000455216800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We explore this question through the ethnographic example of a hackathon, a collaborative software-design competition. We focus specifically on the earliest and, in many ways, most uncertain phase of collaboration, in which commitment and activity simultaneously emerge: team formation. We analyze mercurial allegiances in terms of a technoliberal participation ideology closely associated with the mores of the digital economy, which paradoxically emphasizes intensive project-based collaboration but limited interpersonal responsibility. We examine the verbal and nonverbal resources (such as stance-taking, politeness, reported speech, humor, and gesture) that prospective teammates use to modulate expressions of commitment, and the ways in which they pursue self-interested projects while maintaining social relatedness in order to accomplish joint activity in a context of social volatility.

J,"Bieron, B; Ahmed, U",,,,"Bieron, Brian; Ahmed, Usman",,,Regulating E-commerce through International Policy: Understanding the International Trade Law Issues of E-commerce,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The Internet has facilitated a new wave of economic growth and development. Businesses across the world - both big and small - have taken advantage of the scale, scope, and access that the Internet provides to reach new markets and consumers. A small business in rural America can now reach an individual consumer in the European Union (EU) without any physical footprint in the EU This type of transaction was not possible before the advent of electronic commerce (e-commerce). Moreover, this type of transaction requires a revaluation of a trade regime that was created with only the largest multinational corporations able to truly engage in international trade. The US has created trade policy governing cross-border e-commerce transactions largely through recent free trade agreements (FTAs). Since 2000, every FTA the US has signed has contained a chapter on e-commerce. These chapters have included important protections for the digital economy (e.g., no tax on digital goods, transparency in regulation, and free flow of information). Yet, these chapters have often taken a very narrow view of the issues that they have sought to tackle. It is worthwhile, a decade after these provisions were first written, to revisit and update them to better reflect the nature of modern e-commerce. There are a number of additional issues that are imperative to e-commerce that have not been addressed in past trade regulation. E-commerce often results in the cross-border transfer of digital services. These digital services must be protected against trade-distortive and domestic discriminatory preferences. Moreover, nation-states often rely on narrow interpretations of intellectual property law to restrict the cross-border transfer of e-commerce products and services. These non-traditional barriers to trade must be broken down. Internet intermediaries provide essential services that drive e-commerce. Strong limitations on liability must be guaranteed for these intermediaries. Finally, small businesses are only starting to engage in e-commerce. Future trade regulation should facilitate the growth of small businesses engaged in e-commerce. This article begins by describing the rapid growth of the e-commerce economy. It then reviews the history of past US free-trade agreement e-commerce provisions and suggests how to improve and update these provisions. The document then describes a host of additional e-commerce related issues that should be addressed in trade policy moving forward.","[Bieron, Brian] St Josephs Univ, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Ahmed, Usman] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Saint Joseph's University; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Bieron, B (corresponding author), St Josephs Univ, Philadelphia, PA USA.",,,,,,,,108,25,27,6,137,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In addition, the pace and path of technological change predestines these approaches to fail in the very near future. At the same time, the incidence of disabilities is increasing as our population ages. The same technical advances however hold the key for a radical paradigm shift in our approach to accessibility that can harness the pace of innovation and have it work for us rather than against us. Proposed is the development of a Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure (GPII) that can tap the unprecedented ability to pool resources and match demand with supply enabled by the Cloud to deliver accessibility to every individual where they need it, when they need it and in a way that matches their unique requirements; automatically so that they do not need to negotiate, explain, qualify or justify.","[Vanderheiden, Gregg] Univ Wisconsin, Trace R&D Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Treviranus, Jutta] OCAD Univ, Inclusive Design Res Ctr, Toronto M4E 1X5, ON, Canada",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Vanderheiden, G (corresponding author), Univ Wisconsin, Trace R&D Ctr, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",gv@trace.wisc.edu; jtreviranus@faculty.ocad.ca,,,"National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, U.S. Department of Education [H133E080022]","National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research, U.S. Department of Education(US Department of Education)","This paper is based on sections of the CLOUD4All proposal.

Based on the input-output data spanning 2000-2014 in the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), we use a direct consumption coefficient matrix as the spatial weight matrices to verify inter-industry spillovers between 47 industries of China and its influence on employment by using spatial econometrics model. Empirical results indicate that Internet technology progress in one industry will significantly promote Internet technology progress in adjacent industries. Internet technology progress directly promote the employment within industry. Furthermore, due to the positive inter-industry spillovers, Internet technology progress also exerts positive effects on employment in other industries and positively affects employment within industry again through various feedback loops between industries. Therefore, policy should promote Internet technology in various industries, especially those closely linked to other industries, to stabilize employment and growth.","[Wang, Huijuan; Ding, Lin; Guan, Rong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Math, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Xia, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Xia, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Xia, Yan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sch Publ Policy & Management, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Central University of Finance & Economics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Xia, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.;Xia, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",xiayan@casipm.ac.cn,"WANG, HUIYUAN/IXX-2427-2023; wang, huimin/HDM-8421-2022; wang, jian/HRB-9588-2023; Wang, Hui/HMU-9512-2023; Guan, Rong/K-7983-2012; wang, hui/GRS-4730-2022; wang, hui/HSG-6135-2023; wang, hao/HSE-7975-2023","Ding, Lin/0000-0002-5514-8737","Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20010102]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71974183, 51861125101]; Program for Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences [18YJC790162, 18YJA790056]; Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; disciplinary funds of Central University of Finance and Economics",Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Ministry of Education in China Project of Humanities and Social Sciences; Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics; disciplinary funds of Central University of Finance and Economics,"Financial support from the Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences under grant No. XDA20010102 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 71974183 and 51861125101 is acknowledged.

The work of digital mining, performed in the work of inscribing, registering, and politically organizing mining operations, enables the formation of democratic communities in the digital economy and remains inevitably embedded in social relations as a mode of productive, meaningful action.","[Calvao, Filipe] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, CH-1211 Geneva 1, Switzerland",,"Calvao, F (corresponding author), Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, CH-1211 Geneva 1, Switzerland.",filipe.calvao@graduateinstitute.ch,,,,,,,43,24,27,4,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN, NJ 07030 USA",2330-4847,,,ECON ANTHROPOL,Econ.

Within shared settings, the consequences of these changes are the large-scale generation of interpersonal data generated by and acting on the group rather than individual. We consider how such systems create new forms of observability and hence accountability among members of the home, and draw on the work of Simmel and Goffman to explore how these demands are managed.

More than 1100 cities applied. Kansas City, however, was announced as the winner of the competition. This paper explores the rollout of Google Fiber in Kansas City from three different perspectives. First, we provide a close examination of urban governance and the Fiber project - highlighting numerous regulatory concessions and incentives provided to Fiber during the construction phase. Second, we explore the ways in which pre-existing digital divides and socio-economic inequalities impacted the Fiber plan for Kansas City. Finally, in an effort to better understand the geographic intricacies of Fiber service, this paper uses a novel data mining technique and exploratory spatial data analysis to highlight the provision footprints for two counties in the Kansas City metropolitan area.

However, people are vulnerable to errors and biases in the underlying data and algorithms, especially those with mental illness. Algorithms based on big data from seemingly unrelated sources may create obstacles to community integration. Voluntary online self-disclosure and constant tracking blur traditional concepts of public versus private data, medical versus non-medical data, and human versus automated decision-making. In contrast to sharing sensitive information with a physician in a confidential relationship, there may be numerous readers of information revealed online; data may be sold repeatedly; used in proprietary algorithms; and are effectively permanent.

This article discusses two types of giving that confound the exchangist model: (1) sharing practices within the family; and (2) free gifts to strangers. Once we reject understandings of giving derived from analyses of non-modern economies, it is possible to see that the gift economy is not a rare survival but rather is a central element of contemporary society and indeed the contemporary economy. The task for social theory is not to anachronize giving but to make sense of the variety and complexity of actual contemporary giving practices.

What differences are perceived among the problems of multinational companies (MNCs) and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)? How do managers prepare for change and what changes are they making as they keep the concept of smart technologies in mind? This study highlights the results of a qualitative study conducted in 2018-19 using structured deep interviews with 195 higher leaders of MNCs and SMEs (NVivo 12 was used to analyze the answers). The results show that although managers see and feel the urgent challenges, they are not dealing with additional demands beyond technical developments. Handling of human problems is the most serious task; however, managers are continually postponing decisions related to these problems.

J,"Yan, XT",,,,Yan Xuetong,,,Bipolar Rivalry in the Early Digital Age,CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The year 2019 saw the curtain rise on a US-China bipolar rivalry quite different from the Cold War US-Soviet bipolarity. The fundamental difference between the current bipolar rivalry and that during the Cold War is that ideology is no longer the main engine driving international competition, but rather the new digital dimension of strategic competition that is emerging between the United States and China. Technological advancement over the past 15 years has led world history's entry into the early digital age. The development of digital technology has created new ways of protecting national security, of accumulating national wealth, and of obtaining international support. Cybersecurity is becoming the core of national security and the share of digital economy in major powers' gross domestic product dramatically increases. For the leading powers, strategic competition in cyberspace in this early digital age outstrips to a crucial extent that within physical geographic boundaries. This article observes that Cold War mentality and digital mentality will have mixed impact on foreign policy-making in the digital age, and that interactions between the nations whose foreign policy is simultaneously influenced by both mentalities will shape the emerging international order into one of uneasy peace, where there is no direct war and few proxy wars. It will rather be a scenario reflecting the dark side of globalization and downside of global governance, evident in the violation of agreements, double dealing, cyber-attacks, and technology decoupling between states. Although further digital advancement will indeed change international politics in ever more aspects, US-China bipolar configuration will nevertheless remain in place for at least for two decades, or perhaps longer.","[Yan Xuetong] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yan Xuetong] Russian Acad Sci, Moscow, Russia",Tsinghua University; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Yan, XT (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yan, XT (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Moscow, Russia.",yanxt@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn,,,,,,,105,23,24,10,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1750-8916,1750-8924,,CHIN J INT POLIT,Chin.

Methods of the study were as follows: the questionnaire survey by using the Google Chrome electronic service, content analysis, methods of statistical analysis, and a focus group. The authors' version of the questionnaire was made by using the Likert methodology taking into account indicators of the QS World University Rankings rating system. The data obtained during the three stages were generalized and analyzed by using the descriptive statistics. The regression analysis was used to study the relationship between the motives of the academic staff (AS) and the nature of the stimulating effect of the university authorities on the staff of the university. Results: The discrepancy between the AS motivation structure and the range of stimulation methods applied by the university authorities, a continuous increase in the burden from introduced innovations, and the formal style for employees to fulfill new tasks have been revealed. The analysis of the results on using the techniques and methods by the university authorities to motivate and stimulate the staff has shown the need in new combinatorics, an innovative system that harmoniously combines the advantages of natural and artificial intelligence to motivate the AS in training HR for the digital economy of the 21st century. The new system should be universal and flexibly respond to constant changes in the socio-economic environment. It is important to timely eliminate the contradictions in needs and teachers' opinion on the ideal assessment system of their activities and offered forms of stimulation by universities authorities. The vectors of their activities must be constantly coordinated, based on the AI capabilities. The introduction of AI in the activities of universities improves the competitiveness of promising, innovative teachers and has positive impact on the image, efficiency, academic reputation, and citation index of universities. The authors for the first time ever have studied the problems of using the AI in the motivational system of the university's AS and offered technologies to improve the efficiency of universities by using the motivational AI. The practical importance of solving the problem is related to the real possibility of applying the offered technologies by the university authorities that strive to improve their efficiency and competitiveness in the educational market. The main advantage of the work is related to the advanced solutions of the emerging problems on using the AI in motivating the university staff identified during the three-stage study. The interdisciplinary nature of the study and the offered technologies can serve as the basis for the further study and an additional element that expands the views, approaches, and the framework of categories and concepts of the world science. Conclusion: The most suitable technologies for the university that strives to be efficient include the elimination of the imbalance in the system of staff motives incentives of the university (employer) authorities, the harmonious use of the AI in educational activities and the system of motivation and stimulation of staff where the natural intelligence prevails, and the improvement of the staff's publication and grant activities by using the AI with a synergistic effect due to efficient team building.","[Vinichenko, Mikhail V.; Melnichuk, Alexander V.] Russian State Social Univ, Dept Personnel Management & Personnel Policy, Wilhelm Pieck St, Moscow 129226, Russia; [Karacsony, Peter] Univ Selye Janos, Dept Econ, Bratislayska Cesta,Elektrarenska Cesta 2, Komarno 94501, Slovakia",Russian State Social University (RSSU); J.

We argue that beyond their own individual inadequacies, both approaches have common failings. We conceptualise the role of i4.0 in shaping the FoW in terms of the development of global value chains and i4.0's implications for their digitalisation, where there is an underdeveloped analysis of change. We argue that the clearest expression of i4.0 is in the impact of 'platform capitalism', which already has implications for workers in the Global South and which, via i4.0's digital integration with production, will potentially have significant implications for the quality of work in the Global North.","[Rainnie, Al; Dean, Mark] Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Business Govt & Law, Australian Ind Transformat Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Dean, M (corresponding author), Flinders Univ S Australia, Coll Business Govt & Law, Australian Ind Transformat Inst, Adelaide, SA, Australia.",mark.bernard.dean@gmail.com,"Dean, Mark/AAY-9818-2020","Dean, Mark/0000-0001-7110-5254; Rainnie, Alistair/0000-0001-6071-4193",,,,,72,23,25,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1030-1763,2325-5676,,LABOUR IND,Labour Ind.,JAN 2,2020,30,1,,,SI,,16,33,,10.1080/10301763.2019.1697598,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10301763.2019.1697598,,DEC 2019,18,Industrial Relations & Labor,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,KU8VH,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000500117300001,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Ahmed, U",,,,"Ahmed, Usman",,,The Importance of Cross-Border Regulatory Cooperation in an Era of Digital Trade,WORLD TRADE REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MUTUAL RECOGNITION; TECHNOLOGY; INTERNET; PRIVACY,"Technology is transforming global trade. The global trading system, however, has struggled to keep up with changes in technology. One of the major challenges for the trading system is that the issues raised by digitally enabled commerce are largely regulatory in nature. The issues that are at the forefront of digital trade increasingly relate to citizens' most fundamental interactions, including speech, finance, energy, and transportation. This paper argues that resolving these international regulatory issues will require reforming the approach that has been taken to global trade negotiations. International discussions around the most challenging issues in the digital economy ought to move away from the horse-trading' nature of traditional trade negotiations and towards a strategy focused on regulatory cooperation. Failure to achieve regulatory cooperation could further fragment digital services based upon national borders. The Internet has the potential to positively impact the global economy precisely because it is global, decentralized, and bottom-up in nature. International policymaking through regulatory cooperation can maintain those principles, while protecting fundamental national concerns such as stability, privacy, and security.","[Ahmed, Usman] Georgetown Univ, Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20057 USA",Georgetown University,"Ahmed, U (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Law Ctr, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",,,,,,,,106,23,25,28,94,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2019,18,,,1,SI,,S99,S120,,10.1017/S1474745618000514,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1474745618000514,,,22,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,IO1TF,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000479164100007,View Full Record in Web of Science

To get this right, we need to measure accurately both the value of nominal GDP (done by Bureau of Economic Analaysis) and key price indexes (done mostly by Bureau of Labor Statisticcs). All of us have worked on these measurements while at the BLS and the BEA. In this article, we explore some of the thorny statistical and conceptual issues related to measuring a dynamic economy. An often-stated concern is that the national economic accounts miss some of the value of some goods and services arising from the growing digital economy. We agree that measurement problems related to quality changes and new goods have likely caused growth of real output and productivity to be understated. Nevertheless, these measurement issues are far from new, and, based on the magnitude and timing of recent changes, we conclude that it is unlikely that they can account for the pattern of slower growth in recent years. First we discuss how the Bureau of Labor Statistics currently adjusts price indexes to reduce the bias from quality changes and the introduction of new goods, along with some alternative methods that have been proposed. We then present estimates of the extent of remaining bias in real GDP growth that stem from potential biases in growth of consumption and investment. And we take a look at potential biases that could result from challenges in measuring nominal GDP, including those involving the digital economy. Finally, we review ongoing work at BLS and BEA to reduce potential biases and further improve measurement.","[Groshen, Erica L.; Moyer, Brian C.] US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA; [Aizcorbe, Ana M.] US Bur Econ Anal, Washington, DC USA; [Bradley, Ralph] US Bur Labor Stat, Div Price & Index Number Res, Washington, DC 20212 USA; [Friedman, David M.] US Bur Labor Stat, Prices & Living Condit, Washington, DC 20212 USA",United States Department of Labor; United States Department of Labor; United States Department of Labor,"Moyer, BC (corresponding author), US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA.",egroshen@yahoo.com; brian.moyer@bea.gov; ana.aizcorbe@bea.gov; Bradley.Ralph@bls.gov; Friedman.David@bls.gov,,,,,,,90,23,32,6,37,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

While data management during web and app-based use is already a challenge, as the Internet of Things (IoT) scales up, the number of devices accessing and requiring personal data will go beyond what a person can manually assess in terms of data access requests. Therefore, new approaches are needed for managing privacy preferences at scale and providing active consent around data sharing that can improve fidelity of operation in alignment with user intent. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel agent-based approach to negotiate the permission to exchange private data between users and services. Our agent negotiates based on learned preferences from actual users. To evaluate our agent-based approach, we developed an experimental tool to run on people's own smartphones, where users were asked to share their private, real data (e.g. photos, contacts, etc) under various conditions. The agent autonomously negotiates potential agreements for the user, which they can refine by manually continuing the negotiation. The agent learns from these interactions and updates the user model in subsequent interactions. We find that the agent is able to effectively capture the preferences and negotiate on the user's behalf but, surprisingly, does not reduce user engagement with the system. Understanding how interaction interplays with agent-based automation is a key component to successful deployment of negotiating agents in real-life settings and within the IoT context in particular.","[Baarslag, Tim] Ctr Wiskunde & Informat, NL-1098 XG Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Alan, Alper T.; Gomer, Richard; Gerding, Enrico H.; Schraefel, M.

Although different types of incentives to support startups exist, these incentives are only available to those companies that fulfill the requirements of the funding program to which they have applied.

Design/methodology/approach Empirical findings are drawn from 21 semi-structured interviews (22 informants) possessing differing training expertise regarding digital technology among women entrepreneurs. An open-coding technique was adopted where descriptive codes were first assigned to meaningful statements. Interpretive and pattern codes were then assigned to indicate common themes and patterns, which were reduced to higher-order categories to inform the research questions. Findings The findings specify and validate further gender influences in the digital economy. Digital skills are identified, and strategies to close gender barriers to ICT adoption with EET are described. The findings are discussed in reference to a large-scale, Canadian ICT adoption program. Research limitations/implications - Perceptual data may be idiosyncratic to the sample. The work did not control for type of technology. Gender influences may differ by type of technology. Practical implications - Findings can be used to construct gender-inclusive ICT supports and inform ICT adoption policies. This includes program eligibility and evaluation criteria to measure the socio-economic impacts. Originality/value The study is among the first to examine the intersection between knowledge about gender-related barriers to ICT adoption and EET. The findings can be adopted to ICT support programs targeted at small business owners and entrepreneurs.","[Orser, Barbara; Riding, Allan; Li, Yanhong] Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Orser, B (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",orser@telfer.uOttawa.ca,"Orser, Barbara/AAI-5415-2021","Orser, Barbara/0000-0001-7434-6141; Li, Yanhong/0000-0002-1396-6029",,,,,105,22,24,7,56,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1756-6266,1756-6274,,INT J GEND ENTREP,Int.

From an economic point of view, online digital platforms exert a radical restructuring pressure in particular on already existing economic sectors; however, they do not constitute fundamentally new economic sectors, have a very limited repertoire of business models, and do not establish a substantially new type of firm. Against this background, the author posits the thesis that these platforms' novelty, which distinguishes them from their predecessors, is that they extend well beyond the structuring of purely economic contexts and reach deep into society: Through them, large parts of private and public exchange are privately organized, curated, and commodified.","[Dolata, Ulrich] Univ Stuttgart, Abt Org & Innovat Soziol, Inst Sozialwissensch, Stuttgart, Germany",University of Stuttgart,"Dolata, U (corresponding author), Univ Stuttgart, Abt Org & Innovat Soziol, Inst Sozialwissensch, Stuttgart, Germany.",ulrich.dolata@sowi.uni-stuttgart.de,,,,,,,54,22,22,1,16,SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH,WIESBADEN,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN STASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",1011-0070,1862-2585,,OSTERR Z SOZIOL,Osterr.

China offers the ultimate in data-at-scale settings, and the construction of real-world natural experiments. Chinese e-commerce includes some of the largest firms involved in e-commerce, mobile commerce, social media and social networks. This article was written to encourage young faculty and doctoral students to engage in research that can be carried out in near real-time, with truly experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and with the clear intention of establishing causal inferences that relate the precursors and drivers of observable outcomes through various kinds of processes. We discuss: the relevant data sources and research contexts; the methods perspectives that are appropriate which blend Computer Science, Statistics and Econometrics, how the research can be made relevant for China; and what kinds of findings and research directions are available. This article is not a tutorial on big data analytics methods in general though, nor does it cover just those published works that demonstrate big data methods and empirical causality in other disciplines. Instead, the empirical research covered is mostly taken from Electronic Commerce Research and Applications, which has published many articles on Chinese e-commerce. This Research Commentary invites researchers in China and the Asia Pacific region to expand their coverage to bring into their empirical work the new methods and philosophy of causal data science.","[Phang, David C.

This paper reviews several developments in measuring welfare beyond GDP that were recently presented at the Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence (ESCoE) annual conference in May 2019. The papers discussed fall into three broad areas. First, a significant amount of work has focused on incorporating information about the distribution of income, consumption and wealth in the national accounts. Second, the effects of digitisation and the growth of the internet highlight the potential value in measuring time use as a measure of welfare. Third, the digital revolution has spawned many new, often 'free' goods, the welfare consequences of which are difficult to measure. Other areas, such as government services, are also difficult to measure. Measuring economic welfare properly matters because it affects the decisions made by government and society. GDP does a reasonable job of measuring the marketable output of the economy (which remains important for some policies), but it should be downgraded; more attention should be given to measures that reflect both objective and subjective measures of well-being, and measures that better reflect the heterogeneity of peoples' experiences.","[Aitken, Andrew] Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London, England; [Aitken, Andrew] Econ Stat Ctr Excellence ESCoE, London, England",,"Aitken, A (corresponding author), Natl Inst Econ & Social Res, London, England.;Aitken, A (corresponding author), Econ Stat Ctr Excellence ESCoE, London, England.",a.aitken@niesr.ac.uk,,,,,,,66,21,27,4,37,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0027-9501,1741-3036,,NATL INST ECON REV,Natl.

Using a sample of 4953 digital start-ups the paper evaluates the impact of start-up founding teams' higher education on the probability of securing equity investment and subsequent exit for investors. The main findings are: (1), teams with a founder that has a technical education are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and to exit, but the impact of technical education declines with higher level degrees, (2) teams with a founder that has doctoral level business education are less likely to remain self-financed and have a higher probability of securing equity investment, while undergraduate and postgraduate business education have no significant effect, and (3) teams with a founder that has an undergraduate general education (arts and humanities) are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and exit while postgraduate and doctoral general education have no significant effect on securing equity investment and exit. The findings enhance our understanding of factors that influence digital start-ups achieving equity milestones by showing the heterogeneous influence of different types of higher education, and therefore human capital, on new ventures achieving equity milestones. The results suggest that researchers and policy-makers should extend their consideration of universities entrepreneurial activity to include the development of human capital.","[Ratzinger, Daniel; Greenman, Andrew; Mosey, Simon] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Haydn Green Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Nottingham, England; [Amess, Kevin] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Nottingham, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Ratzinger, D (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Haydn Green Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Nottingham, England.",daniel.ratzinger@nottingham.ac.uk,"Greenman, Andrew Keith/L-1866-2019; Mosey, Simon/AAB-4707-2021; Mosey, Simon/JXW-6801-2024","Greenman, Andrew Keith/0000-0002-6617-9344; Mosey, Simon/0000-0002-3452-5230;","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Nottingham [EP/G037574/1, EP/G065802/1]; RCUK's Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Nottingham; RCUK's Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute,"This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant numbers EP/G037574/1, EP/G065802/1) through the Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Nottingham and the RCUK's Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute.

Participants perform a double role regarding reputation management: while engaging in exchanges with other peers, they build their individual reputation capital' and simultaneously execute community oversight. In Couchsurfing (CS), a network often cited as paradigmatic of the sharing economy, there is, however, a clear bias for positive references. In the digital economy literature, participants' friendly behaviour is understood as motivated by self-interest and an incentive to maintain a positive reputation. Social research on reputation in CS attributes the bias to fear of retaliation, but also hints at norms of reciprocity leading travellers to require positive feedback for hospitality. This article analyses the lived experience of reputation management in CS and argues that participants seek to reconcile direct and general reciprocity. It proposes breaking these practices down into boundary-work and creative avoidance and argues these result in insufficient protection of inexperienced participants against problematic members.","[Mikolajewska-Zajac, Karolina] Kozminski Univ, Jagiellonska 59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland",Kozminski University,"Mikolajewska-Zajac, K (corresponding author), Kozminski Univ, Jagiellonska 59, PL-03301 Warsaw, Poland.",kmikolajewska@kozminski.edu.pl,,"Mikolajewska-Zajac, Karolina/0000-0001-7982-9142",National Science Centre in Poland (NCN) [UMO-2013/09/N/HS4/03790],National Science Centre in Poland (NCN),"This research was supported by the National Science Centre in Poland (NCN), based on the agreement number UMO-2013/09/N/HS4/03790.",,55,21,21,4,64,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1368-4310,1461-7137,,EUR J SOC THEORY,Eur.

Blockchain technology can help to realize a self-sovereign identity that puts the user in control of her information, by enabling a decentralized way to handle public key infrastructure.

Studies available at the regional level in Europe focus on ICT use by households. This paper sheds light on the digital divide by exploring the differences in ICT use across European regions, investigating simultaneously not only ICT use by households but also by firms. Using canonical correlation analysis, we first explore the existence of regional patterns of ICT use in Europe. Second, we test the influence of regional characteristics to explain ICT use by households and firms. Our results identify a first pattern defined by the regions that combine high levels of both ICT uses. This pattern is explained primarily by the quality of the regional government, knowledge-intensive services and economic development variables. A divide between southern and northern, and western and eastern regions is detected. We also identify a second pattern that captures ICT use by firms (not related to the first), predominantly determined by educational variables and some economic factors. This pattern does not exhibit the geographical digital divide found in the first. The findings show that there are synergies and regional factors explaining the use of ICT both at home and at work at the regional level in Europe that should be considered when designing public policy geared toward encouraging ICT diffusion.","[Billon, Margarita] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Econ Struct & Dev Econ, Carretera Colmenar Viejo,Km 15 Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain; [Lera-Lopez, Fernando] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Pamplona 31006, Spain; [Marco, Rocio] Univ Autonoma Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Carretera Colmenar Viejo,Km 15 Campus Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid; Universidad Publica de Navarra; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Lera-Lopez, F (corresponding author), Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Pamplona 31006, Spain.",margarita.billon@uam.es; lera@unavarra.es; rocio.marco@uam.es,"MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/L-3511-2013; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/CAG-4979-2022; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/CAH-0724-2022; Billon, Margarita/L-2498-2013; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/J-4450-2016","MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; MARCO CRESPO, ROCIO/0000-0002-2854-9121; Billon, Margarita/0000-0003-4860-9133; Lera-Lopez, Fernando/0000-0002-9230-9405",,,,,83,21,22,6,41,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Currently, a growing number of municipal fiber projects are underway or planned while the international community and the telecommunications industry are yet undecided about the role and type of municipal intervention. This paper takes a holistic view of municipal broadband in Europe, aiming to understand the factors that determine municipal strategies in fixed Next-Generation Access (NGA) networks and the implications of municipal broadband to regulation and markets. The data suggests that the determining factors are (a) the engagement of public utilities; (b) the involvement of the private sector in joint infrastructure projects; (c) the local demand for retail and wholesale services; and (d) the institutional and regulatory framework at the European and national scale. The findings of the study indicate that (a) municipal initiatives are highly dependent on national factors, thus the resulting interventions fare strong resemblance within a single country, while they can be substantially different across national contexts; (b) current EU provisions for public involvement in broadband development stimulate municipal plans for large scale arrangements; and (c) national regulatory frameworks, that primarily address vertical integrated incumbents and nationwide markets, may need adjustments to handle emerging access monopolies of regional and city broadband infrastructures.

This growing chorus brings together complaints about breaches of privacy and data protection, competition and market consolidation, and electoral and other political interference. The most powerful of these companies have grown into behemoths by establishing themselves both as purveyors of their own products, and as the hosts of platforms that circumscribe, and profit from, the activities of other organizations. This platform function gives these companies substantial power over their commercial rivals, who depend upon these platforms to operate. More fundamentally, this article argues, the dual function of these platform companies allows them to straddle the very categories that we use to organize our understanding of the political and economic world. They are at once product companies, service companies and infrastructure companies; players in the market and markets of the marketplace; private platforms and public spheres. The straddling of these categories places these companies in the institutional cracks of the regulatory system. Moreover, companies consciously exploit this regulatory straddling to thwart challenges to their power. This article argues that such deliberate shape-shifting has allowed these companies to control the political and economic stage on which their own power must be contested, and compromised the ability of scholars, the public and ultimately states to see clearly, and therefore constrain, that power.","[Atal, Maha Rafi] Copenhagen Business Sch, Polit Econ Corp Power, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Atal, MR (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",mat.msc@cbs.dk,,,,,,,57,20,20,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

In response, cybercriminals' attention has shifted dramatically from showing off skills and conducting individual attacks into high sophisticated attacks with financial gain as the goal. This, inevitably, poses a challenge to the cybersecurity community as they strive to find solutions to preserve the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the individual users' and corporates' private data and services. Cybercriminals mainly deploy malware to achieve their goals, which could be in the form of ransomware, botnets, etc. The use of encryption, packing and polymorphism techniques makes it harder to detect the malware files, especially when these are created in great numbers every day. In this paper, a novel framework, named Malware Spectrogram Image Classification (MSIC), is proposed. It employs spectrogram images in conjunction with the convolution neural network to classify a malware file to its corresponding family and to differentiate it from a benign file. Further, this research shares with the research community two privately collected labeled malicious and benign datasets. The evaluation of MSIC showed its effectiveness to be 91.6% F-measure and 92.8% accuracy in classifying malware files to their corresponding families, in comparison to, respectively, 90.6% and 92.3% results produced by the grayscale image classification approach. Likewise, in classifying files as malicious or benign, MSIC scored 96% F-measure and accuracy results compared to 95.5% with the grayscale solution. Also, MSIC required less computational time in converting and resizing the files than the grayscale framework.","[Azab, Ahmad; Khasawneh, Mahmoud] Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Engn & Technol, Egaila 15453, Kuwait",American University of the Middle East,"Azab, A (corresponding author), Amer Univ Middle East, Coll Engn & Technol, Egaila 15453, Kuwait.",ahmad.azab@aum.edu.kw,"Khasawneh, Mahmoud/HIR-8737-2022","Khasawneh, Mahmoud/0000-0001-7849-7932; Azab, Ahmad/0000-0002-9807-1602","College of Engineering, American University of the Middle East, Kuwait","College of Engineering, American University of the Middle East, Kuwait","This work was supported by the College of Engineering, American University of the Middle East, Kuwait.",,42,20,23,0,5,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2020,8,,,,,,102007,102021,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2999320,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2999320,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,MH0HC,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000546410800012,View Full Record in Web of Science

As we relate, formula apportionment of global corporate income was used a century ago before commercial and political interests promoted separate accounting, thereby providing both precedent and experience to inform its re-adoption.","[McGaughey, Sara L.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Business Strategy & Innovat, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia; [Raimondos, Pascalis] QUT, Sch Econ & Finance, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia",Griffith University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"McGaughey, SL (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Business Strategy & Innovat, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",s.mcgaughey@griffith.edu.au,,"Raimondos, Pascalis/0000-0002-8580-3595; McGaughey, Sara/0000-0002-1112-4733",,,,,65,20,21,6,71,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",0047-2506,1478-6990,,J INT BUS STUD,J.

It was determined in the course of scientific and practical study of the specifics of implementation and payment of indirect taxes, that there is no general methodological approach to indirect taxation of international services accomplishment in the field of B2B e-commerce, due to the differences in the indirect taxes applied: VAT or retail tax. In this regard, the hypothesis is proposed that the provision of optimal tax conditions for electronic marketplaces to a considerable degree is fraught with the shift in business opportunities towards B2B transactions in tax jurisdictions, providing equal conditions for non-residents. In terms of international practice, the study is of significant interest as the experience of introduction of VAT implementation and payment in relation to B2B operations, VAT-exempt transactions, given that the tax and regulatory system of the jurisdiction under study is assessed as a system with increased business risks. The above calculations showed that B2B non-resident is in unequal conditions compared to the taxpayers of a particular jurisdiction, and the difference in the calculated VAT value is significant. However, the introduced obligation to pay VAT has not provoked the non-residents to move to the e-commerce marketplace of other tax jurisdictions. The risk zones identified during the study determined the essential need to build an optimal model on digital marketplaces, which, in our opinion, can be the basis for the development of the targets for mitigation of the tax risks associated with VAT payment on B2B marketplaces. In our opinion, the proposed model is universal for all business management systems and applied ERP systems, taking into account the provision of all parties in B2B transactions with access to information. According to the results of the study, it was determined that the disclosure of information on B2B operations, indirect taxes and tax risks in corporate reporting is not imputed by the regulators and has a largely inconsistent and unstructured nature. In this regard, any proactive disclosure in corporate public reporting on B2B is possible only if the company treats the information requests from external users as significant, taking into account the calculation of the cost of preparation of the information, which does not exceed the expected effects.","[Akhmadeev, Ravil; Morozova, Tatiana] PRUE, Stremyanny Lane 36, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Voronkova, Olga] Altai State Univ, Lenina Str 61, Barnaul, Russia; [Sitnov, Alexey] Financial Univ Russian Federat Govt, Leningradskiy Prospekt 49, Moscow 125993, Russia",Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Altai State University,"Akhmadeev, R (corresponding author), PRUE, Stremyanny Lane 36, Moscow 117997, Russia.",ahm_rav@mail.ru; isfyrmorozova@gmail.com; olka2004@yandex.ru; ASitnov@fa.ru,"Morozova, Tatiana/K-3355-2018; Akhmadeev, Ravil/F-4984-2016; VORONKOVA, Olga Yuryevna/AEO-5438-2022; Sitnov, Alexey/H-1636-2019","Morozova, Tatiana/0000-0003-3833-2783; Akhmadeev, Ravil/0000-0002-7526-0144; VORONKOVA, Olga Yuryevna/0000-0002-3106-4643; Sitnov, Alexey/0000-0003-2221-4037",,,,,61,20,20,0,14,ENTERPRENEURSHIP & SUSTAINABILITY CENTER,VILNUS,"M K CIURLIONIO STR 86A, VILNUS, 03100, LITHUANIA",2345-0282,,,ENTREP SUSTAIN ISS,Entrep.

First are the ever more omnipresent systems of mass social control, repression, and warfare promoted by the ruling groups to contain the real and the potential rebellion of the global working class and surplus humanity. Second is how the global economy is itself based more and more on the development and deployment of these systems of warfare, social control, and repression simply as a means of making profit and continuing to accumulate capital in the face of stagnation - what I term militarized accumulation, or accumulation by repression - and that now goes well beyond military Keynesianism. And third is the increasing move towards political systems that can be characterized as 21st century fascism, or even in a broader sense, as totalitarian. Digitalization makes possible the creation of a global police state. The mounting crisis appears to cement the emerging digital economy with the global police state. There is a triangulation of far-right, authoritarian, and neo-fascist forces in civil society, reactionary political power in the state, and transnational corporate capital, especially speculative finance capital, the military-industrial-security complex, and the extractive industries - all three interwoven with high-tech or digital capital.","[Robinson, William I.] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Sociol Global & Int Studies & Latin Amer & Iberia, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Robinson, WI (corresponding author), Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Sociol, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",wirobins@soc.ucsb.edu,,,,,,,34,20,25,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0896-9205,1569-1632,,CRIT SOCIOL,Crit.

In this regard, paying special attention to the investigation of main drivers, stakeholders and challenges of the open data movement in Estonia, the author argues that a highly centralized administrative policy that has been widely used previously by authorities in advancing various technology-driven public reforms, which partly explains a truly impressive advance of this Nordic state in e-government, e-commerce, e-banking and evoting, does not necessarily lead to same effective results in the open data domain. On the contrary, the presence of established democratic institutions and developed civil society as well as an incredibly advanced and dynamic private ICTindustry that values competition and professional curiosity along with a very strong sense of patriotism and adherence to a particular neighborhood deeply rooted in Estonian society has played a much more important role in diffusing the concept rather than just traditional government directives and strategies.","[Kassen, Maxat] Eurasian Humanities Inst, Polit Sci, Astana, Kazakhstan",Eurasian Humanities Institute,"Kassen, M (corresponding author), Eurasian Humanities Inst, Zhumabayev Ave 4, Astana 010000, Kazakhstan.",maka.mca2@gmail.com,"Kassen, Maxat/D-5954-2018","Kassen, Maxat/0000-0001-9643-4249",,,,,61,20,22,8,84,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0268-1102,1554-0170,,INFORM TECHNOL DEV,Inform.

The main property that contract signing protocols must achieve is fairness of the exchange. The solutions presented to date are divided into two major types: those that have a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness and those that do not. In the literature, we find more than 40 published proposals, but none of these proposed protocols has become a recognized or de facto standard in the market. Blockchain has provided a new way to address classic problems such as double spending, as well as problems such as fairness. In this article, we present a protocol for contract signing based on blockchain. Our proposed protocol does not require a conventional TTP, and it does not present the disadvantages of solutions without a TTP (computational and/or communication cost). The protocol satisfies the necessary security requirements: fairness, timeliness and non-repudiation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol with a cost analysis and a proof of concept implementation. In addition, we show how Ethereum can be integrated in our solution as an alternative platform to the use of Bitcoin. Finally, we show how our proposal improves previous solutions for contract signing based on blockchain in terms of cost, efficiency and security.","[Ferrer-Gomila, Josep-Lluis; Francisca Hinarejos, M.; Isern-Deya, Andreu-Pere] Univ Balearic Isl UIB, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Cra Valldemossa,Km 7-5, Palma De Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Hinarejos, MF (corresponding author), Univ Balearic Isl UIB, Palma De Mallorca, Illes Balears, Spain.",xisca.hinarejos@uib.es,"Ferrer-Gomila, Josep-Lluis/N-2887-2016; Isern-Deyà, Andreu Pere/K-4690-2014; Hinarejos, M.

Section 1 of the article discusses the broad challenges that digitization poses for the international legal framework for trade regulation. I argue first that the traditional classification of products into goods and services under the WTO system is structurally incompatible with the digital economy. I also argue that striking the appropriate balance between trade liberalization and the pursuit of legitimate public policy objectives in a digital trade agreement will be uniquely challenging because certain features that are intrinsic to the digital industry and business strategies of established players in the digital market raise serious anticompetition challenges. A multilateral agreement regulating digital trade needs to acknowledge and address these challenges. Section 2 surveys the efforts that have been undertaken to regulate digital trade as manifested in the WTO Work Program on Electronic Commerce. Acknowledging that the digital trade agenda of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement could be used as a benchmark for discussions on e-commerce at the WTO, I argue that future negotiations for a multilateral digital trade policy will not benefit from using the TPP's digital trade agenda as a benchmark. The TPP does not reconcile systemic tensions between the digital economy and the extant WTO system or address the anticompetition challenges that are unique to the digital ecosystem.","[Neeraj, R.

While such jobs are attractive and improve life chances, situated ImS employees face the difficult task of transitioning from their traditional communities to the relatively modern ImS workplace. These transition experiences expose them to a variety of work-life challenges and, at the same time, serve as occasions for development. This paper draws on an inductive qualitative study of an up and coming Indian ImS company and explores how ImS employees experience sociocultural transitions and realize developmental impacts. The findings suggest that compartmentalization and integration strategies help ImS employees manage boundaries arising from the contrasting cultural expectations of the community and the workplace. Impact sourcing employees respond to sociocultural transition challenges in the workplace through a series of cognitive adjustments, which involves the creation of fictive kinships, job crafting, and experimenting with provisional selves. Furthermore, the analysis shows how intense engagement with sociocultural transitions can lead to the development of crucial individual and collective capabilities. In closing, a model of capability development of ImS employees is outlined, and the implications for ImS companies are discussed.","[Sandeep, M.

An essential dimension of the discussion is the widely shared view that a basic income could guarantee sufficient purchasing power for unemployed, underemployed and precarious workers should technological unemployment and labour market insecurity increase. A budget-neutral basic income has serious limitations as an economic stabilisation grant, but if financing proposals are revised, these limitations can be tackled. Even though guaranteeing sufficient purchasing power for unemployed, underemployed and precarious workers does not necessarily require an unconditional universal benefit, it seems clear that traditional activation based on strict means-testing and obligations will not be a strategy flexible enough to guarantee sufficient consumer demand in fluctuating labour markets. An economically sustainable solution might be to reduce means-testing gradually and to study carefully the effects.","[Pulkka, Ville-Veikko] Univ Helsinki, Pengerkatu 21a A 16, Helsinki 00500, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Pulkka, VV (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Pengerkatu 21a A 16, Helsinki 00500, Finland.",ville-veikko.pulkka@helsinki.fi,,"Pulkka, Ville-Veikko/0000-0002-5507-7107",,,,,45,20,21,0,87,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1024-2589,1996-7284,,TRANSFER-LONDON,Transfer,AUG,2017,23,3,,,,,295,311,,10.1177/1024258917708704,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1024258917708704,,,17,Industrial Relations & Labor,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,FI4UY,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000411974900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Seen from this perspective, we consider the extent to which EVE both ideologically and economically supports the extension of capital into increasing aspects of our everyday livesa game in which many play, but few win.","[Taylor, Nicholas] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Commun, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Bergstrom, Kelly; Jenson, Jennifer] York Univ, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; [de Castell, Suzanne] Univ Ontario, Inst Technol, Fac Educ, Oshawa, ON, Canada",North Carolina State University; York University - Canada; Ontario Tech University,"Taylor, N (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Commun, 2301 Hillsborough, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",nttaylor@ncsu.edu,"Bergstrom, Kelly/AAP-9065-2020","Bergstrom, Kelly/0000-0002-7510-1813",Air Force Research Laboratory,Air Force Research Laboratory,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory.",,54,20,29,7,45,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1555-4120,1555-4139,,GAMES CULT,Games Cult.,JUL,2015,10,4,,,,,365,388,,10.1177/1555412014565507,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1555412014565507,,,24,Cultural Studies; Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Cultural Studies; Communication,CK5EK,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000356244900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies have suggested that processing a task in the cloud is more energy-efficient than processing the same task locally. However, these studies have generally ignored the power consumption of the network and end-user devices when accessing the cloud. In this paper, we develop a power consumption model for interactive cloud applications that includes the power consumption of end-user devices and the influence of the applications on the power consumption of the various network elements along the path between the user and the cloud data centre. As examples, we apply our model to Google Drive and Microsoft Skydrive's word processing, presentation and spreadsheet interactive applications. We demonstrate via extensive packet-level traffic measurements that the volume of traffic generated by a session of the application vastly exceeds the amount of data keyed in by the user. This has important implications on the overall power consumption of the service. We show that using the cloud to perform certain tasks consumes more power (by a watt to 10 watts depending on the scenario) than performing the same tasks locally on a low-power consuming computer and a tablet.","[Vishwanath, Arun] IBM Res Australia, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia; [Jalali, Fatemeh; Hinton, Kerry; Alpcan, Tansu; Ayre, Robert W.

However, these studies have not fully explained the business structure of new media and new popular music. They also failed to predict K-pop's global success via YouTube and iTunes. The emergence of Internet-based music stores and music video streaming sites, particularly YouTube, has a strong connection to Korean content as it allows Korean artists to bypass conventional music distributors who control business-to-customer music distribution channels in the United States and Europe. The emergence of the digital economy powered by PCs and smartphones, ushered in a new era of business-to-business music distribution, thus minimizing transaction costs of the global music business for Korean entertainment firms. This article argues that K-pop producers, with no alternative channels for distributing their music to global audiences for profit, actively chose YouTube for its free music distribution despite its low-profit margins from royalty fees. I-pop and American pop music distributors, however, avoided You Tube because the profit margin from YouTube was far lower than from traditional media, such as CDs and iTunes, giving K-pop primary standing in the niche market.","[Oh, Ingyu] Korea Univ, Res Inst Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Hyo-Jung] Yonsei Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Korea University; Yonsei University,"Oh, I (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Res Inst Korean Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",oingyu@korea.ac.kr; equalist@naver.com,"Lee, Hyo Jung/G-6299-2019; Oh, Ingyu/AAM-7089-2020","Oh, Ingyu/0000-0002-1645-8767",,,,,36,20,23,4,62,KOREAN NATL COMMISSION UNESCO,SEOUL,"C P O BOX 64, SEOUL 100-600, SOUTH KOREA",0023-3900,,,KOREA J,Korea J.,WIN,2013,53,4,,,,,34,58,,,,,,25,Asian Studies,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Asian Studies,277ES,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000328802400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, the vast majority of these types of critical systems are configured in isolated locations where their control depends on the ability of a few, supposedly trustworthy, human operators. However, this assumption of reliability is not always true. Malicious human operators (criminal insiders) might take advantage of these situations to intentionally manipulate the critical nature of the underlying infrastructure. These criminal actions could be not attending to emergency events, inadequately responding to incidents or trying to alter the normal behaviour of the system with malicious actions. For this reason, in this paper we propose a smart response mechanism that controls human operators' operational threats at all times. Moreover, the design of this mechanism allows the system to be able to not only evaluate by itself, the situation of a particular scenario but also to take control when areas are totally unprotected and/or isolated. The response mechanism, which is based on Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs) for the constant monitoring of observed critical infrastructures, on reputation for controlling human operators' actions, and on the ISA100.11a standard for alarm management, has been implemented and simulated to evaluate its feasibility for critical contexts.

The aims of this work are to find a relationship between self-assessed health and internet use by older people in European countries and to ascertain whether this relationship differs in countries with a more developed eHealth policy. Materials and methods: An ordered logistic regression is estimated for all countries in the sample and for two countries subsets which differ in their eHealth performance. Individual data is collected by SHARE. The classifying criterion of eHealth performance is based on the 'eHealth' policy dimension of the indicator used to construct the Digital Economy and Society Index. The average marginal effects are computed for the variable of internet use. Results: Results show that older people who use the internet tend to report better health status. This relationship however may not hold for low levels of health and it is stronger in countries with low eHealth performance. Conclusion: Policy measures on eHealth not only contribute to people's health but also help to alleviate critical situations such as the one created by the Covid-19 pandemic.","[Tavares, Aida Isabel] Univ Lisbon, Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, ISEG, Lisbon, Portugal; [Tavares, Aida Isabel] Univ Coimbra, CEISUC, Ctr Study & Res Hlth, Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Coimbra,"Tavares, AI (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Lisbon Sch Econ & Management, ISEG, Lisbon, Portugal.",atavares@iseg.ulisboa.pt,"Tavares, AIsabel/HPG-6135-2023","Tavares, AIsabel/0000-0003-3487-1202","European Commission [QLK6-CT-2001-00360, SHARE-I3: RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE: CIT5-CT-2005-028857, SHARELIFE: CIT4-CT-2006-028812, 211909, 227822, 261982]; German Ministry of Education and Research; Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science; U.S. National Institute on Ageing [U01_AG09740-13S2, P01_AG005842, P01_AG08291, P30_AG12815, R21_AG025169, Y1-AG-4553-01, IAG_BSR06-11, OGHA_04-064, HHSN271201300071C]; SHARE Project",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); German Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science(Max Planck Society); U.S. National Institute on Ageing(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); SHARE Project,"The SHARE data collection has been primarily funded by the European Commission through FP5 (QLK6-CT-2001-00360), FP6 (SHARE-I3: RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE: CIT5-CT-2005-028857, SHARELIFE: CIT4-CT-2006-028812) and FP7 (SHARE-PREP: No211909, SHARE-LEAP: No227822, SHARE M4: No261982).

This article attempts to answer the question: How could family businesses embrace the values and overcome the hindrances to digital entrepreneurship? To this end, this article suggests a conceptual model of digital entrepreneurship adoption in family firms.

While many corporations have a direct window into our lives through constant, ubiquitous data collection, our knowledge of their inner workings is often partial and incomplete.

Much has happened since 2015 that vindicates and challenges the book's main themes. To answer many of the concerns raised in the volume in light of the most recent developments, we have brought together leading thinkers who have explored the interplay of politics, economics, and culture in domains ordered algorithmically by managers, bureaucrats, and technology workers. While the contributions are diverse, a unifying theme animates them. Each offers a sophisticated critique of the interplay between state and market forces in building or eroding the many layers of our common lives, as well as the privatization of spheres of reputation, search, and finance. Unsatisfied with narrow methodologies of economics or political science, they advance politico-economic analysis.

Some authors have predicted a sea change in engineering workflow through model-based systems engineering. Despite benefits, the prevalence of effective modeling techniques in industry is an open question. Massive open online courses and similar online offerings are a new opportunity to learn about industry practices. In this paper, we draw on data from the Architecture and Systems Engineering: Models and Methods to Manage Complex Systems online program from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has enrolled 4200 participants, to understand how models are used in practice. We use aggregated data from questions to investigate model use by participants and their organizations. The results demonstrate that whereas modeling is widely recognized for its potential, the actual deployment against problems of interest is substantially lower than the participant-stated potential. We also find that many participants reported low use of basic modeling best practices, such as specialized programs. We propose that this research is a fresh use of descriptive analysis to uncover actual modeling practices. Future research should target more detail about modeling practices in engineering-driven firms, and the reasons why modeling adoption is low or overstated.","[Cameron, Bruce; Adsit, Daniel Mark] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Adsit, DM (corresponding author), MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",bcameron@mit.edu; adsit@sdm.mit.edu,"Cameron, Bruce G/E-2826-2012",,,,,,29,19,20,4,35,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",0018-9391,1558-0040,,IEEE T ENG MANAGE,IEEE Trans.

Internet and Digital Marketing have become important factors in campaigns, which attract and retain Internet users. This study aims to identify the main ways in which users can be gained and retained by using Digital Marketing. The Delphi method with in-depth interviews was the methodology used in this study. The results of the research show the most important actions for achieving user recruitment and loyalty with Digital Marketing from the opinions of consulted experts. The limitations of this study are those related to the number of experts included in the study, and the number of research papers consulted in the literature review. The literature review and the results of this research are used to propose new solid research with a consolidated critical methodology. This research deals with a new approach that will optimize web technologies for the evolution of user trends, and therefore, will be of academic and professional use for marketing managers and web solution developers. The conclusions of the investigation show the key factors, discarding others that do not affect the optimization of conversions in B2C businesses such as the duration of the session and the rebound percentage. Likewise, the results of the research identify the specific actions that must be carried out to attract and retain users in B2C companies that use the Digital Marketing ecosystem on the Internet. The requirements for companies that wish to implement a model to optimize conversions using the current digital economy are also shown.","[Lopez Garcia, Juan Jose] Univ Distance Madrid UDIMA, Social Fac, Via Serv A-6,15,28400 Collado Villalba, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Lizcano, David] Univ Distance Madrid UDIMA, Sch Comp Sci, Via Serv A-6,15,28400 Collado Villalba, Madrid 28040, Spain; [Ramos, Celia M.

It has become a key socio-technical 'artefact' helping to reconfigure the nexus between technology and spatial experience in the 21st century. In this essay, I will trace Google's evolving strategy in the mapping space. I will argue that the evolution of Google Maps exemplifies way in which a contemporary digital platform 'succeeds' by becoming embedded as a foundational resource for a variety of other uses and services. At one level, this can be understood in terms of what Gillespie has conceptualized as the 'politics of platforms', contributing to the emergence of what has recently been dubbed 'platform capitalism'. At a deeper level, I will argue that Google Maps exemplifies the complex dynamics of what Simondon calls 'technical objects' that always exist in relation to both an evolving technical system, and the other systems constituting a more or less integrated social milieu.","[McQuire, Scott] Univ Melbourne, Sch Culture & Commun, Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne; Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance,"McQuire, S (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",mcquire@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,33,19,19,4,21,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",2057-0473,2057-0481,,COMMUN PUBLIC,Commun.

Ongoing projects and prior work in the fields of big data, data mining and data science has revealed how relevant data can be used to enhance products and services. There are uncountable applications and advantages of relevant data. The most valuable companies of today treat data as a commodity, which they trade and earn revenues. But use of relevant data has also drawn attention by the other non-conventional organizations and domains. To facilitate such trading, data marketplaces have emerged. In this paper we present a global data marketplace for users to easily buy and share data. The main focus of this research is to have a central data sharing platform for the recycling industry. This paper is a part of the research project Recycling 4.0 which is focusing on sustainably improving the recycling process through exchange of information.

This area is in the midst of a housing crisis, with a significant undersupply of housing units and rising unaffordability, especially the city of Dublin. While the sharing economy, better exemplified here by Airbnb, has become a major part of the global economy, it is less clear what is the regional impact of Airbnb, an online platform that allows people rent out part or all of their home for short stays. Among the claimed benefits for the tourism sector there are concerns that home sharing removes potential housing supply from the private rental sector to the short-term rental sector, which could aggravate the housing shortage. Along these lines, this paper documents this contemporary urban spatial issue, using rental asking prices data and data from Airbnb listings. The study does not intend to criticize the sharing platforms themselves but rather their disruptive impact and the short-term rental market within a digital economy context more widely. It is found that whilst not the only factor for the current housing crisis in Greater Dublin, Airbnb's presence in the short-term housing is a vivid element of the current housing crisis in the country, which poses challenges for regulators and home seekers.","[Lima, Valesca] Maynooth Univ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University,"Lima, V (corresponding author), Maynooth Univ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",valesca.lima@mu.ie,,,Irish Research Council [GOIPD/2018/104],"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology)",This work was supported by the Irish Research Council [grant number GOIPD/2018/104].,,51,19,21,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",2168-1376,,,REG STUD REG SCI,Reg.

Ever-changing customer needs and technical progress increase the pressure on organizations to continuously improve and innovate their business processes. The ability to anticipate incremental and radical process changes required in the future is a critical success factor. However, organizations often fail to forecast future business process designs and process performance. One reason is that Business Process Management (BPM) is dominated by reactive methods (e.g., lean management, traditional process monitoring), whereas there are only a few future-oriented approaches (e.g., process simulation, predictive process monitoring). This paper supports the shift towards proactive BPM by coining the notion of process forecasting - an umbrella concept for future-oriented BPM methods and techniques. We motivate the need for process forecasting by eliciting various types of process forecasting from BPM use cases and create a first understanding of its scope by providing a definition, a reference process, showing the steps to be followed in process forecasting initiatives, and a positioning against related BPM sub-areas. The definition and reference process are based on a structured literature review.","[Poll, Rouven; Rupprecht, Lea] Univ Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, Augsburg, Germany; [Polyvyanyy, Artem] Univ Melbourne, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia; [Rosemann, Michael] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Roeglinger, Maximilian] Univ Bayreuth, FIM Res Ctr, Bayreuth, Germany",University of Augsburg; University of Melbourne; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Bayreuth,"Poll, R (corresponding author), Univ Augsburg, FIM Res Ctr, Augsburg, Germany.",rouven.poll@fim-rc.de; artem.polyvyanyy@unimelb.edu.au; m.rosemann@qut.edu.au; maximilian.roeglinger@fim-rc.de; lea.rupprecht@fim-rc.de,"Rosemann, Michael/I-9823-2012; Röglinger, Maximilian/GQH-4037-2022; Polyvyanyy, Artem/AAR-9578-2020","Polyvyanyy, Artem/0000-0002-7672-1643; Rosemann, Michael/0000-0003-3303-2896",,,,,30,19,20,13,44,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-98648-7; 978-3-319-98647-0,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2018,11080,,,,,,496,512,,10.1007/978-3-319-98648-7_29,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-98648-7_29,,,17,"Business; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Operations Research & Management Science,BS4YD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000724119800029,View Full Record in Web of Science

Private collective organizations face two main challenges: (1) to promote collective innovation while preserving the private interests of the firms within the collective, and (2) to ensure that collective innovation does not weaken healthy competition. Through a case study of the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), an exemplary private collective federation of organizations composed of standardization bodies, industry consortia and technology producers, we identify organizational solutions to these challenges. We find that a combination of specific IP rights instruments is key to manage these trade-offs. We also find that the combined policies of essential patenting, FRAND, and maximum royalty rate help overcome the specific challenges associated with collective innovation within competitive contexts. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings for managers and for policy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The importance of KM in product technological innovation has been critically recognised, whereas the potential for customer KM is not pervasively studied. This inspires the demand to study how congruently managing product knowledge and customer knowledge with the support of Information Technology (IT), does enable the conversion of tacit knowledge into codified knowledge for creating value and reducing risk.

This broad question has motivated the work behind the present work, which reviews the strongest themes of the Third International Conference on Technology Policy and Innovation (ICTPI), which was held in Austin, TX, in August of 1999. Under the broad designation of creating value for the 21st century in the globalized learning economy, the Conference brought together a range of experts to discuss technology policy and the management of innovation in a context much influenced by a dynamic of change and a necessary balance between the creation and diffusion of knowledge. While the idea of inclusive development developed in previous Conferences entails a process of shared prosperity across the globe following local specific conditions, it is crucial to understand both the features of knowledge-induced growth in rich countries, as well as the challenges and opportunities for late-industrialized and less developed countries. Thus, this special issue includes a set of extended contributions to the Austin conference that are largely grounded on empirical experiences of different regional and national contexts. The aim of this introductory paper is to set the stage for these contributions, with an original contribution on possible roles for science and technology policy in the globalized economy. While much attention has been devoted to digital technologies, a more fundamental change at the start of the new millennium is the increasing importance of knowledge for economic prosperity and the emergence of a learning society. The analysis shows that innovation should be understood as a broad social and economic activity within the framework of that society: it should transcend any specific technology, even if revolutionary, and should be tied to attitudes and behaviors oriented towards the exploitation of change by adding value.

In this paper, we take a place-based approach to examine how and what CT practices youth learn through designing mobile games in and for their own communities. We conducted three after school workshops with 29 participants (13 female, 16 male, ages 10-16) in a rural city in the Western United States. Youth designed place-based, mobile games to share stories and experiences about local environmental or civic issues using the Augmented Reality and Interactive Storytelling (ARIS) programming platform. We collected and analyzed a range of data including field notes, design artifacts, screencasts, and final reflective interviews. Using Brennan and Resnick (2012) framework for studying and assessing the development of CT, we illustrate how youth engaged with CT practices and how their local topics facilitated their engagement with civic issues beyond the screen. Findings demonstrate how youth can engage with CT practices and their local communities through designing computational artifacts. We discuss implications for how leveraging place-based computational tools afford equitable and accessible CT integration in interdisciplinary contexts.","[Litts, Breanne K.; Lewis, Whitney E.] Utah State Univ, Instruct Technol & Learning Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Mortensen, Chase K.] Utah State Univ, Comp Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Litts, BK (corresponding author), Utah State Univ, Instruct Technol & Learning Sci, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",breanne.litts@usu.edu,,"Litts, Breanne/0000-0003-4981-3515",,,,,50,18,19,1,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1049-4820,1744-5191,,INTERACT LEARN ENVIR,Interact.

This occurs where the value of such objects is transferred subsequently by means of disposal of such tokens, which is a subject of separate rights to it. The paper outlines two core problems, which were inspired by recent legislative activities in Belarus and Russia. The first is a possible displacement of existing legal regimes of objects of civil rights by the legal regime of the token. Secondly, the problem of definition of the nature of rights to tokens arises (in rem versus ad personam) as well as remedies for their violations. Provisions of the Belarus Decree On the development of digital economy of 21 December 2017 and drafts of the laws on blockchain and ICO, discussed in Russian Parliament and Government are taken to illustrate these problems.

This study examines firm strategies on offering such consumer-customizable products. Our analysis shows that a monopolistic firm obtains a greater profit from offering a consumer-customizable product than from offering a preconfigured standardized product only if consumers are sufficiently capable to conduct the customization task; otherwise, it is more profitable for the firm to offer a standardized product. Moreover, consumers obtain a greater surplus when the firm offers the customizable product. We also consider the case where the firm is capable of offering both a customizable product and a standardized product and find that the firm benefits more from offering both products than offering either product if consumer customizing capability and the customization cost are not too high. Interestingly, when the firm offers both products, its effort in enhancing consumer customizability (e.g., offering free consumer training) always benefits both the firm and consumers, but its effort in increasing the value of the standardized product (e.g., offering more functions) can hurt both the firm profit and consumer surplus.

To provide a deeper analysis this research also tests for intervening variables that affect a WSS. The results confirm that all three variables positively influence WSS, and show that IMS is an intervening variable between IC and WSS.

Bringing theories of emotional labour and gentrification together with recent writing on the spatialities of platforms, I argue that for the production of value and the capture of profit, STR platforms like Airbnb rely on neighbours' emotional labour of performing home. Because this strategy operates through banal practices in quite ordinary neighbourhood spaces, it hides in plain sight - and yet, for neighbours who find themselves enrolled without remuneration into the productive machinery of platform capitalism, it simultaneously creates feelings of alienation and exhaustion. Drawing on interviews with neighbourhood residents and Airbnb hosts in New Orleans, I show how neighbours' unremunerated performances of home contribute to their own feelings of displacement in place while simultaneously operating as an apparatus of value production for the platform. Although I focus on the case of Airbnb in New Orleans, this study also broadly demonstrates the invisibilisation of value, the challenges of opting out of the digital economy, and the embodied ways in which relations of platform urbanism can impact the everyday life of people with no formal obligation to platforms themselves.","[Spangler, Ian] Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",University of Kentucky,"Spangler, I (corresponding author), Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",itsp222@uky.edu,"Spangler, Ian/AAB-3192-2020","Spangler, Ian/0000-0002-8395-8120",,,,,85,17,19,7,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-2754,1475-5661,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

This study reveals new regulatory loopholes in the digital labour market, which have substantially eroded the basis of social policy arrangements in China, softening participation in social insurance branches and compliance with labour regulations remarkably. Drawing upon the theoretical concepts of Polanyi on embeddedness and disembeddedness, we argue that the digital employment sector in China has been increasingly disembedded from social institutions and social control.

But what unites all of these financial media is their connection to recordkeeping systems. Each swipe sends data hurtling through invisible infrastructures to verify accounts, record purchase details, exchange funds, and update balances. With payment cards, banks and merchants have been able to amass vast archives of transactional data. This information is a valuable asset in itself. It can be used for in-house data analytics programs or sold as marketing intelligence to third parties. This research examines the development of payment cards in the United States from the late 19th century to present, drawing attention to their fundamental relationship to identification, recordkeeping, and data mining. The history of payment cards, I argue, is not just a history of financial innovation and computing; it is also a history of Big Data and consumer surveillance. This history, moreover, provides insight into the growth of transactional data and the datafication of money in the digital economy.","[Lauer, Josh] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Commun, Durham, NH 03824 USA",University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire,"Lauer, J (corresponding author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Commun, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",josh.lauer@unh.edu,"Lauer, Josh/AFF-5263-2022","Lauer, Josh/0000-0001-9028-2360",,,,,97,17,18,1,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",2053-9517,,,BIG DATA SOC,Big Data Soc.,JAN,2020,7,1,,,,,,,2.05395E+15,10.1177/2053951720907632,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2053951720907632,,,14,"Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,KZ8LG,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000523509100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The need to build accountability into the IoT is motivated by the opaque nature of distributed data flows, inadequate consent mechanisms and lack of interfaces enabling end-user control over the behaviours of Internet-enabled devices. The lack of accountability precludes meaningful engagement by end users with their personal data and poses a key challenge to creating user trust in the IoT and the reciprocal development of the digital economy. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (EU GDPR) seeks to remedy this particular problem by mandating that a rapidly developing technological ecosystem be made accountable. In doing so, it foregrounds new responsibilities for data controllers, including DP by design and default, and new data subject rights such as the right to data portability. While GDPR is technologically neutral, it is nevertheless anticipated that realizing the vision will turn upon effective technological development. Accordingly, this article examines the notion of accountability, how it has been translated into systems design recommendations for the IoT and how the IoT Databox puts key DP principles into practice.","[Urquhart, Lachlan] Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Horizon Digital Econ Res, Informat Technol Law, Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Lodge, Tom] Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Mixed Real Lab, Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England; [Crabtree, Andy] Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Mixed Real Lab, Comp Sci, Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Urquhart, L (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Sch Comp Sci, Horizon Digital Econ Res, Informat Technol Law, Wollaton Rd, Nottingham NG8 1BB, England.",lachlan.urquhart@gmail.com; tom.lodge@nottingham.ac.uk; andy.crabtree@nottingham.ac.uk,"Urquhart, Lachlan/ABD-4290-2021","Urquhart, Lachlan/0000-0001-5144-5024","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M001636/1, EP/N028260/2, EP/M02315X/1]; EPSRC [EP/N028260/1, EP/M001636/1, EP/N028260/2, EP/M02315X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [grant numbers EP/M001636/1, EP/N028260/2, EP/M02315X/1].",,28,17,18,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0967-0769,1464-3693,,INT J LAW INFORM TEC,Int.

This transition's possible effects are yet to be sufficiently studied as they require thorough analysis and the use of the appropriate tools. Moreover, it is necessary to develop new indicators considering the specificity of the economy's digitalization. The article presents a methodology for studying the phenomena of the digital economy and digital divide in Russian regions. Using the methodology, we developed new indicators, approaches and techniques for studying the changes at different levels of hierarchy and the effects of their impact. In the first block we established a composite indicator for studying regional imbalances in the development of digital economy. This indicator has several advantages as it takes into account the availability of the basic information and communication technologies and wired network services. In the second block we introduced the method of classifying the Russian regions by the level of digital technologies development. Differences in the mean values of variables across clusters allow determining the magnitude of the inequality in the technology's dissemination between the groups of regions. In the third block we identified the key determinants of digital development and information inequality based on the panel data regression models. We built separate models for the information and communication technology accessibility index and its two sub-indices, assuming they were influenced by different and divergent factors. Defining the effective institutional mechanisms for digital development will determine the direction for boosting the competitiveness of the Russian regions and engage additional sources of economic growth. Furthermore, it will help increasing innovation activity and reducing the digital divide.","[Arkhipova, M.

This paper focuses on telecommunication infrastructure as the backbone of the fast-growing digital economy, and raises important questions about the early National Broadband Network (NBN) rollout in Australia. The paper asks whether there was any case of pork barrelling in the selection of early release sites that enjoyed a regional competitive advantage against other localities that had to wait several years to receive the infrastructure. The answer to this question then leads to a second question about the degree to which voting in the early NBN release sites has swung following the infrastructure rollout. In order to answer these questions the paper examines the voting patterns in the earlier NBN release sites versus all electorates in the Federal elections in 2007-2013 using the data available via Australian Electoral Commission. Findings show trends of politically targeted funding, followed by vote swing in the very next election.","[Alizadeh, Tooran; Farid, Reza] Griffith Univ, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Alizadeh, T (corresponding author), Griffith Univ, 170 Kessels Rd, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",t.alizadeh@griffith.edu.au; r.farid@griffith.edu.au,"Alizadeh, Tooran/AAX-2371-2020","Alizadeh, Tooran/0000-0001-5424-3348",,,,,105,17,20,2,20,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5961,1879-3258,,TELECOMMUN POLICY,Telecommun.

However, consumers are often unwilling to accept being price discriminated for fear that they would end up paying more for the same product or service. This article demonstrates that by rewarding consumers for disclosing personal information it is possible to achieve a situation where first-degree price discrimination is mutually advantageous and both buyers and sellers gain by adopting such a pricing model. The conditions required for this to happen are investigated and the impact on social welfare is discussed. Finally, the article considers the robustness of this model when consumers adopt an opportunistic behavior which consists in manipulating personal data in order to masquerade as a consumer with a lower willingness to pay.","[Rayna, Thierry] Novancia Business Sch Paris, F-75015 Paris, France; [Darlington, John] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Striukova, Ludmila] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",Imperial College London; University of London; University College London,"Rayna, T (corresponding author), Novancia Business Sch Paris, 3 Rue Armand Moisant, F-75015 Paris, France.",trayna@novancia.fr; j.darlington@imperial.ac.uk; l.striukova@ucl.ac.uk,"Rayna, Thierry/Q-1848-2016; Striukova, Ludmila/AFQ-4796-2022; Klitzke, Karina/IXD-3488-2023","Rayna, Thierry/0000-0003-0144-6031","RCUK (Research Councils United Kingdom) Digital Economy Programme; EPSRC [EP/D061717/1, EP/H022562/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/H022562/1, EP/D061717/1] Funding Source: researchfish",RCUK (Research Councils United Kingdom) Digital Economy Programme; EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"This research has been supported by a research grant of the RCUK (Research Councils United Kingdom) Digital Economy Programme.

To help curb this problem, we propose the novel notion of a responsible Internet, which provides higher degrees of trust and sovereignty for critical service providers (e.g., power grids) and all kinds of other users by improving the transparency, accountability, and controllability of the Internet at the network-level. A responsible Internet accomplishes this through two new distributed and decentralized systems. The first is the Network Inspection Plane (NIP), which enables users to request measurement-based descriptions of the chains of network operators (e.g., ISPs and DNS and cloud providers) that handle their data flows or could potentially handle them, including the relationships between them and the properties of these operators. The second is the Network Control Plane (NCP), which allows users to specify how they expect the Internet infrastructure to handle their data (e.g., in terms of the security attributes that they expect chains of network operators to have) based on the insights they gained from the NIP. We discuss research directions and starting points to realize a responsible Internet by combining three currently largely disjoint research areas: large-scale measurements (for the NIP), open source-based programmable networks (for the NCP), and policy making (POL) based on the NIP and driving the NCP. We believe that a responsible Internet is the next stage in the evolution of the Internet and that the concept is useful for clean slate Internet systems as well.","[Hesselman, Cristian; de Ruiter, Joeri; Moura, Giovane C.

Drawing on interviews with 51 Australian photographers, the authors examined the extent to which, and why, photographers engage with or resist digital platform work. The photographic profession is an ideal context in which to examine such questions due to the fragmentation of the workforce and the recent proliferation of platforms. The findings revealed that the level of worker engagement is explained by platform control over price, service and product quality, and relationship management. The experiences of self-employed, freelance workers complicate our understanding of work afforded by digital platforms. Engaging with the political economy surrounding freelance creative labour, the study enables a richer theorisation of the experiences of platform-generated work in this context.","[McDonald, Paula; Williams, Penny; Mayes, Robyn] Queensland Univ Technol, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"McDonald, P (corresponding author), Queensland Univ Technol, QUT Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",p.mcdonald@qut.edu.au,"Williams, Penny/AAV-5364-2020","Williams, Penny/0000-0002-2680-9129; McDonald, Paula/0000-0002-3549-4691; Mayes, Robyn/0000-0002-8661-3638",Australian Research Council [DP180101191],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was funded through an Australian Research Council Discovery Project No. DP180101191.",,56,16,16,10,61,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1461-4448,1461-7315,,NEW MEDIA SOC,New Media Soc.,JUN,2021,23,6,,,,,1602,1623,1.46144E+15,10.1177/1461444820917905,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1461444820917905,,MAY 2020,22,Communication,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication,SP2RB,,Green Submitted,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000532934400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Prospects for innovative development of oilfield service companies are the key technological areas within the first project of the Hi-Tech Strategy of the German Government until 2020 - Industry 4.0. The purpose of this study is to assess the prospects for innovative development of the domestic oilfield service industry in the context of the digitalization of the oil and gas industry. The subject of the research is the process of the formation of key technological lines of Industry 4.0 and their impact on the domestic oil and gas sector. The research is based on logical-theoretical and empirical analyses. The main factors that determine processes of digital transformation in the oil and gas industry are considered; the results of digitalization processes in the largest foreign and Russian industry companies of the upstream and oilfield services segments are presented. The information base is made up of data from oilfield service and oil and gas producing companies, presented on the official websites of companies in the public domain on the Internet. It has been proven that, unlike the world's leading companies in oilfield services segment, independent domestic oilfield service companies provide mainly traditional service technologies in a fairly narrow range. The limited scope of functioning and technological capabilities of Russian companies is explained by the lack of necessary investment in development and expansion of business, as well as interest on the part of the state and corporate sectors in the development and replication of domestic technologies and the formation of a full-fledged oilfield services market in Russia.","[Razmanova, Svetlana, V] Branch Gazprom VNIIGAZ LLC Ukhta, Ukhta, Komi Republic, Russia; [Andrukhova, Olga, V] Ukhta State Tech Univ, Ukhta, Komi Republic, Russia",,"Razmanova, SV (corresponding author), Branch Gazprom VNIIGAZ LLC Ukhta, Ukhta, Komi Republic, Russia.",s.razmanova@sng.vniigaz.gazprom.ru; o.gavina@mail.ru,"Андрухова, Ольга/AAG-8674-2021; Razmanova, Svetlana Valerievna/B-1442-2014","Андрухова, Ольга/0000-0001-8314-0524; Razmanova, Svetlana Valerievna/0000-0002-3865-8508",,,,,19,16,16,2,8,SAINT-PETERSBURG MINING UNIV,SANKT-PETERSBURG,"SAINT-PETERSBURG MINING UNIV, SANKT-PETERSBURG, 00000, RUSSIA",2411-3336,2541-9404,,J MIN INST,J.

This article argues that a central ambition of digital society has been the pursuit of an integrated commodity form. The novelty of this integrated commodity stems not only from the convergence of production and consumption but also from the subsumption of sociability itself. As a consequence, we are required to consider all social actions within digital society as being transactions enshrined within an economy of integrated markets. Our acceptance of these new commodity relations is paving the way for a 'great integration' of simultaneous transactions across different social domains. Borrowing from Karl Polanyi's account of an earlier transformation, this article will propose that the prerequisites of digital society and the integrated commodity form have been established through the constitution of a series of 'fictitious commodities'.","[Athique, Adrian] Univ Queensland, Cultural Studies, St Lucia, Qld, Australia",University of Queensland,"Athique, A (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Inst Adv Studies Humanities, Level 4,Forgan Smith Bldg, St Lucia, Qld 4272, Australia.",a.athique@uq.edu.au,,"Athique, Adrian/0000-0002-9692-4421",,,,,63,16,16,13,80,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0163-4437,1460-3675,,MEDIA CULT SOC,Media Cult.

Moreover, closing this gap through the establishment of a 'Nurse Chatbot' will be innovative, favorably scalable and customizable within a decentralized health network, and potentially sustainable in the new digital economy. Following are the assumptions 1) caring communicated textually is highly 'transactive' in chronic disease self-management support/CDSMS for goal agreements between agents and for overcoming the system noise in the form of cross-entropy, perplexity, and information wastage; 2) 'Nurse Chatbot' is the interlocutor in nursing care and the nursing agency by superpositioning and entanglement; and 3) possible effects of chathot-user transactions are information flows, management of health, and patient satisfaction.

The state responds positively to the agency of people with disabilities in social development and participation by opening opportunities for research grants, start-up funds, publicities and policy lobbying. It is here we see the hope in such a collaborative and mutually constitutive approach to innovative social policies that aim at inclusive and sustainable growth - something that deserves concerted, comparative research and evaluation by policy scholars.","[Goggin, Gerard] Univ Sydney, Dept Media & Commun, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Yu, Haiqing] RMIT Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Fisher, Karen R.; Li, Bingqin] Univ New South Wales, Social Policy Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Sydney; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); University of New South Wales Sydney,"Yu, HQ (corresponding author), RMIT Univ, Sch Media & Commun, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",haiqing.yu@rmit.edu.au,"Dubisetty, Mallikarjuna Rao/JWO-4481-2024; Li, Bingqin/C-5058-2017; Fisher, Karen/B-8710-2008","Li, Bingqin/0000-0003-2240-0876; Yu, Haiqing/0000-0001-8368-4214; Goggin, Gerard Michael/0000-0002-2954-5309; Fisher, Karen/0000-0002-0828-6395",UNSW Collaborative Research Grant 2017,UNSW Collaborative Research Grant 2017,This work was supported by the UNSW Collaborative Research Grant 2017.,,49,16,16,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1751-6234,1751-6242,,J ASIAN PUBLIC POLIC,J.

At their purest, these forms deliver economic benefits as gifts and depend on cooperation without authority. Drawing loosely on Habermas, we may call this a lifeworld economy - an economy that is coordinated by communicative interaction - as opposed to the systems economy of market and state, coordinated by money and power. This formulation, however, faces both theoretical and practical challenges. On the theoretical side, the notion of a lifeworld economy does not sit easily with Habermas's own formulation of the distinction between lifeworld and systems. On the practical side, the digital lifeworld economy has been steadily colonized by capitalist businesses, which have frequently found ways to incorporate forms of gift and cooperation into profit-oriented business models. This article proposes to reformulate Habermas's distinction as a reference to different kinds of causal mechanisms, detaching it from his functionalist framework and enabling a more flexible application to empirical cases. It then applies it to a series of iconic cases from the digital economy: Amazon, Wikipedia, and open source software, to demonstrate its continuing relevance to very current issues.","[Elder-Vass, Dave] Loughborough Univ Technol, Sociol, Loughborough, Leics, England",Loughborough University,"Elder-Vass, D (corresponding author), Univ Loughborough, Dept Social Sci, Ashby Rd, Loughborough LE11 3TU, Leics, England.",d.elder-vass@lboro.ac.uk,,,,,,,60,16,20,8,80,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1368-4310,1461-7137,,EUR J SOC THEORY,Eur.

A key way that missions can use their administrative capacity to support economic recovery is developing effective technology use and acquisition strategies in host countries, which is a peacekeeping-wide policy goal outlined in the high-level Performance Peacekeeping report. Our paper introduces the theoretical channels through which missions' use of information communication technologies (ICTs) can support local economic development in post-conflict settings, making a theoretical argument that draws on both the literature on ICTs in peacekeeping and in economic development. We specify a Cobb-Douglas model that describes the potential impact of peacekeeping mission-led ICT investment on longer term economic development in combination with statistics on mission technology spending and internet use in host countries, providing a formal scaffold for our theoretical argument. Using this model and data in combination with a case study of the Central African Republic-based United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic mission, we argue that peacekeeping missions should use their purchasing power and stabilizing influence to attract value-added technology investment to support economic development.","[Martin-Shields, Charles P.] George Mason Univ, Sch Conflict Anal & Resolut, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Bodanac, Nicholas] Univ Sydney, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",George Mason University; University of Sydney,"Martin-Shields, CP (corresponding author), George Mason Univ, Sch Conflict Anal & Resolut, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",cmarti17@gmu.edu,,,,,,,55,16,18,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1353-3312,1743-906X,,INT PEACEKEEPING,Int.

Using a unique dataset representing the above system consisting of the rate of trust in teachers providing good education in the context of quality of education and their social status, of the level of higher education and the state of ICT advancement toward digitally-rich learning environments, an empirical numerical analysis of 20 countries was attempted. These countries were classified as advanced, semi-advanced and growing. It was found that while ICT advanced countries have embarked on co-evolution of ICT, higher education and trust, ICT growing countries have not been successful in this due to a vicious cycle between ICT and trust. Finland's educational success can be attributed to co-evolution which corresponds to the emergence of un-captured GDP similarly to the leading edge of an ICT-driven disruptive business model. The paradox of education productivity in ICT growing countries can be attributed to disengagement. It is suggested that steady ICT advancement fully utilizing external resources in digitally-rich learning environments may be essential to ICT growing countries in achieving higher education. On the other hand, continuing transcending innovation to transform learning environments into new digitally-rich learning environments should be maintained in ICT advanced countries. A new approach for constructing the above-described co-evolution in a systematic way was thus explored. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This article explores the rise of live events within one such industry - journalism - linking the rise of live publishing' to post-industrial career norms and digital economy business models. Drawing on interviews with 10 media companies and participant observation at two conferences produced by The Wall Street Journal, this article shows how media companies position themselves as the legitimate conveners of conferences and forums by redeploying traditional discourses of cultural authority; this enables them to bring together their existing networks of sources, audience members, and sponsors. By convening these groups in a physical space, live publishing takes isolated nodes within media organizations' networks and renders them visible and accessible to each other, allowing media firms to extract value from these previously immaterial relationships. More broadly, live publishing demonstrates how the interaction of virtual and physical networks allows organizations to transform and redeploy cultural authority into new systems of networked power.","Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Larson, C (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, 450 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",cmlarson@stanford.edu,,"LARSON, CHRISTINE/0000-0002-4171-809X",,,,,58,16,19,0,20,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0163-4437,1460-3675,,MEDIA CULT SOC,Media Cult.

In this paper, we suggest that such information could be used to characterize both the size of the digital economy and outsourcing at country level. We analyse the topological structure of the network of trade in digital services (trade in bits) and compare it with the more traditional flow of manufactured goods across countries. To perform meaningful comparisons across networks with different characteristics, we define a stochastic benchmark for the number of connections among each country-pair, based on hypergeometric distribution. Original data are filtered so that we only focus on the strongest, i.e. statistically significant, links. We find that trade in bits displays a sparser and less hierarchical network structure, which is more similar to trade in high-skill manufactured goods than total trade. Moreover, distance plays a more prominent role in shaping the network of international trade in physical goods than trade in digital services.","[Riccaboni, Massimo] IMT Sch Adv Studies, LIME, Lucca, Italy; [Riccaboni, Massimo] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Managerial Econ Stategy & Innovat, Louvain, Belgium; [Rossi, Alessandro] Univ Trento, DISA, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] Univ Trento, Dept Econ, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Schiavo, Stefano] OFCE DRIC, Valbonne, France",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; KU Leuven; University of Trento; University of Trento,"Schiavo, S (corresponding author), Univ Trento, Dept Econ, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",m.riccaboni@imtlucca.it; alessandro.rossi@unitn.it; stefano.schiavo@unitn.it,"SCHIAVO, Stefano/B-6147-2012; Rossi, Alessandro/F-4462-2012; Riccaboni, Massimo/D-4102-2009","SCHIAVO, Stefano/0000-0001-9740-5167; RICCABONI, Massimo/0000-0003-4979-8933; Rossi, Alessandro/0000-0002-2226-2146",,,,,53,16,17,6,50,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

In addition to the direct financial impact of cybercrime, it can also be argued that the digital data and the information it represents that can be communicated through the Internet, can have additional intrinsic value to the cybercriminal. In response to the perceived value and subsequent demand for illicit data, a sophisticated and self-sufficient underground digital economy has emerged. The aim of this paper is to extend the author's earlier research that first introduced the concept of the Cybercrime Execution Stack by examining in detail the underlying data objectives of the cybercriminal. Both technical and non-technical law enforcement investigators need the ability to contextualise and structure the illicit activities of the cybercriminal, in order to communicate this understanding amongst the wider law enforcement community. By identifying the potential value of electronic data to the cybercriminal, and discussing this data in the context of data collection, data supply and distribution, and data use, demonstrates the relevance and advantages of utilising an objective data perspective when investigating cybercrime.

Guided by the control of users' attention, the consumption figures for digital environments, mainly social media, show that addictive use is associated with multiple psychological, social, and physical development problems. The study presented develops a theoretical proposal regarding attention. In the first part, the research analyzes how attention has been studied and how it behaves using three disciplines: neurophysiology, neuropsychology, and economics. In the second part, considering this general framework, the study uses categories of the three disciplines to explain the functioning of social media, with special emphasis on their interactive, attractive, and addictive design. Finally, the article presents, as a practical example of the exposed theory, the main results of two case studies that describe social media consumption among young people. The research shows the relevance of the theoretical study of attention as a key element by which to understand the logics that dominate the interactive design of social media. It also uses a multidisciplinary perspective.

This paper also identifies the flaws in the existing regulations and policies on Fintech, and it also proposes an ideal framework for a fintech law as a strategy to strengthen consumer protection and to accelerate the growth of the digital economy in Indonesia. Design/methodology/approach This is normative research with a legal approach. Data were collected through a literature study and analyzed using legal norm method. Findings The promising potential and growth of the fintech industry in Indonesia need to be supported by a sound legal framework in the form of Indonesian Law. In regards to fintech, Indonesia does not yet have a specific law on fintech. Existing regulations in the Bank of Indonesia Regulations (PBI) and Indonesia Financial Services Authority Regulations (POJK) only regulate the technical aspects of the industry, thus providing a less sound legal power. Bank of Indonesia (BI) and Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK) have limited authority in the making of regulations and the regulations produced by these institutions cannot stipulate criminal provisions. This results in inadequate consumer protection measures. The Investment Alert Task Force reported 2,018 illegal P2P lending, 472 illegal investment companies and 69 illegal pawnbrokers. The accumulation of online lending transactions in December 2019 reached a total of IDR81.50tn, seeing a 259.56% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, the amount of bad debt reached IDR13.6tn, seeing a 169.48% increase. These reasons illustrate how urgently Indonesia needs Fintech Law. Research limitations/implications This research only examines the existing Fintech regulations in Indonesia. The approach method used is normative legal research. Practical implications This research is expected to be useful for The House of Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia (DPR), the Ministry of Law and Human Rights, the Indonesia Financial Services Authority (OJK) and Bank of Indonesia (BI) in drafting the Fintech Law. Social implications This research is expected to increase protection for consumers, investors and providers of fintech services and accelerate the growth of the digital economy in Indonesia. Originality/value Regulating fintech in the Indonesian Law is meant to give legal certainty and better legal protection for consumers, investors and providers of fintech services. Seeing that the value of the Indonesian digital economy in 2019 has reached USD40bn (approximately IDR586tn), Indonesia is philosophically, juridically and sociologically in urgent need of Fintech Law.","[Kharisma, Dona Budi] Univ Sebelas Maret, Fak Hukum, Dept Business Law, Surakarta, Indonesia",Sebelas Maret University,"Kharisma, DB (corresponding author), Univ Sebelas Maret, Fak Hukum, Dept Business Law, Surakarta, Indonesia.",donabudikharisma@staff.uns.ac.id,"Kharisma, Dona Budi/JZE-2721-2024; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022","Kharisma, Dona Budi/0000-0003-1361-5613",,,,,25,15,16,2,20,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1754-243X,1754-2448,,INT J LAW MANAG,Int.

Product life cycles are getting shorter. Production has to be faster and increasingly local. The acceleration of time-to-market could happen thanks to the solutions of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), with supply chains morphing into highly adaptive networks with integrated entities. In this paper, we seek to exemplify the potential impact of I4.0 adoption on the competitiveness of the firms (being foreign subsidiaries among others) and ask about the nature of modernization as part of the global value chain in which the enterprise operates. Our research based on four case studies reveals that the competitive advantage of a firm could be modified in the era of Industry 4.0 as a result of a sector's transformation and changing relationships with partners. These findings correspond with the literature stressing the uncertainty and complexity of the digital economy in general, as well as difficulties with the precise measuring of the expected benefits. The fourth industrial revolution emphasizes the race to the top giving priority to quality rather than cost reduction as a method of improving competitiveness and, since it implies the emergence of connected companies, truly linked with each other, the disappearance of clear boundaries between them.","[Gotz, Marta] Vistula Univ, Dept Business & Int Relat, Ul Stoklosy 3, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland; [Jankowska, Barbara] Poznan Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int Competitiveness, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Vistula University; Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Götz, M (corresponding author), Vistula Univ, Dept Business & Int Relat, Ul Stoklosy 3, PL-02787 Warsaw, Poland.",m.gotz@vistula.edu.pl; barbara.jankowska@ue.poznan.pl,"Jankowska, Barbara/AFJ-9013-2022; Götz, Marta/K-2586-2017","Jankowska, Barbara/0000-0003-1984-3449; Götz, Marta/0000-0002-8764-871X",,,,,63,15,15,2,26,NATL RESEARCH UNIV HIGHER SCH ECONOMICS,MOSCOW,"MYASNITSKAYA, 20, MOSCOW, 101000, RUSSIA",1995-459X,2500-2597,,FORESIGHT STI GOV,Foresight STI Gov.,,2020,14,4,,,,,61,78,,10.17323/2500-2597.2020.4.61.78,http://dx.doi.org/10.17323/2500-2597.2020.4.61.78,,,18,Economics; Management,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,PG7OO,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000599920700006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Assessing its effect is crucial for the development of policies that support the labour markets, bringing many benefits for workers, organizations, the economy, and society as a whole. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the level of digitalization of the Romanian economy in the EU context, as well as the impact of the ICT sector on employment and skills. The results of the comparative analysis at the EU level show that there are significant negative gaps between Romania and the EU average, as well as between Romania and Visegrad countries, in terms of Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI), the contribution of ICT sector to employment and GDP, employed ICT specialists (as % of total employment) and the impact of ICT on tasks and skills. A strong positive correlation was identified between the level of digitalization of economy and society (expressed by DESI) and the labour productivity in the EU countries. Therefore, in order to reduce these negative gaps and to create an inclusive digital economy and society, a higher level of digitalization of work is required, especially in countries (like Romania) where there is a low level of digital economy, as well as low labour productivity. At the same time, it is essential that the EU labour force develops the necessary digital skills so that workers win the race of digitalization of jobs. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

Towards gaining business competitiveness, businesses are operated from the stance of dynamic business model that places focus on both economic activities and, more importantly, value-added benefits. One essential value embedded into business strategies refers to the aspect of sustainability in conjunction to environmental social governance (ESG). Within the context of Malaysia, ESG practices have been expected to grow rapidly in years to come, along with the vision of becoming a digital economy nation, by 2050. The continuous discussions appear to support the significance of implementing ESG practices amidst organizations, which in turn, could enhance a more sustainable economic growth for the country. Although many studies have probed into the dimensions of ESG, little attention has been given to the ESG practices incorporated into business strategy agenda. Design/methodology/approach This paper combed through the literature to retrieve the multi-dimensions of ESG concepts, as well as related in-depth insights into ESG disclosures amongst leading companies established in Malaysia. As for the research design, this study used the content analysis method and the ESG Grid as the benchmarking tool to explore superior commitments amongst its peers. Findings As a result, this study stumbled upon two major outcomes: the pattern of ESG disclosures in telecommunications industry and the approaches in implementing ESG practices in telecommunications companies. These two aspects appear essential to establish a competitive advantage, apart from addressing the issues raised by concerned stakeholders. Originality/value Hence, this study offers several vital insights into the practical value to learn from the best experiences, aside from analyzing the current progress of ESG practices within the context of developing nation.","[Jasni, Nur Syuhada; Yusoff, Haslinda; Zain, Mustaffa Mohamed; Yusoff, Noreena Md; Shaffee, Nor Syafinaz] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Accountancy, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi MARA,"Jasni, NS (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Accountancy, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.",nursy168@salam.uitm.edu.my; hasli229@salam.uitm.edu.my; dmustaff@salam.uitm.edu.my; noree692@salam.uitm.edu.my; norsyafinaz@salam.uitm.edu.my,"Jasni, Nur Syuhada/AFR-9363-2022; Md Yusoff, Noreena/IUQ-4676-2023","Jasni, Nur Syuhada/0000-0002-9318-5344;",Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia [600-RM l/DANA 5/3/LESTARI (80/20 1 5)]; Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under FRGS Grant [FRGS/1/2017/SS01/UITM/02/10],"Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia(Ministry of Education, Malaysia); Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under FRGS Grant",The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support provided by the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia under Lestari Grant (600-RM l/DANA 5/3/LESTARI (80/20 1 5) and FRGS Grant (FRGS/1/2017/SS01/UITM/02/10).,,105,15,15,4,58,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1747-1117,1758-857X,,SOC RESPONSIB J,Soc.

The purpose of the initiative was the development of a smart phone technology platform for people with disability. The paper's purpose is to answer questions about the ways in which the mobile technology, seen here as assistive technologies, supported the development of disability citizenship and active citizenship. Data were collected through in-depth interviews conducted at three points in the 13-week programme during which participants with disability received customised support for their phone and training in its use, at no cost. Fifteen participants volunteered to take part in the research project, along with their significant other and service provider. Key themes were identified in the preliminary analysis. Exploring these using Ragnedda's ([2017]. The third digital divide: A Weberian approach to digital inequalities. Abingdon: Routledge) three levels of digital divide, and Wilson's ([2006].

Although the mobile technologies were very successful as assistive technologies for some participants, the findings reinforced the potential for such technologies to further entrench aspects of social exclusion. They also identified ways in which the shift in the role of the NPO to social entrepreneurship, and its relationships with government and private enterprise, had the potential to undermine the exercise of disability citizenship by turning participants into consumers.","[Darcy, Simon; Yerbury, Hilary] Univ Technol Sydney, Business Fac, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Maxwell, Hazel] Univ Tasmania, Coll Hlth & Med, Church St, Lilyfield, NSW 2040, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Tasmania,"Maxwell, H (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Coll Hlth & Med, Church St, Lilyfield, NSW 2040, Australia.",hazel.maxwell@utas.edu.au,"Darcy, Simon/G-1407-2010; Maxwell, Hazel/IZD-6315-2023","Darcy, Simon/0000-0002-5394-2566; Maxwell, Hazel/0000-0003-0610-4698; Yerbury, Hilary/0000-0002-1525-3268",University of Technology Sydney Partnership Grant,University of Technology Sydney Partnership Grant,This work was supported by a University of Technology Sydney Partnership Grant.,,42,15,16,1,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

Recently, the growth of digital marketing and new forms of customer data have disrupted many traditional aspects of marketing practice. Companies are increasingly able to collect data directly from their customers, via large technology firms or from specialist data providers. This has reduced the demand for the traditional fieldwork-based data collection that remains a core focus within the market research curricula. This article considers the past, present, and future role of market research education in the light of the changing practitioner environment. An audit of market research courses is carried out, weaknesses identified, and suggestions made to better align market research courses with evolving skills requirements. More broadly, the article challenges educators to evaluate the extent to which the marketing curriculum can respond to the disruptions brought by the emerging digital economy.","[Nunan, Daniel] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Di Domenico, MariaLaura] Univ Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, England",University of Portsmouth; University of Surrey,"Nunan, D (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth PO1 2UP, Hants, England.",daniel.nunan@port.ac.uk,,"Nunan, Dan/0000-0002-0514-3276",,,,,40,15,18,7,57,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1470-7853,2515-2173,,INT J MARKET RES,Int.

Developed country Members want to abandon the Doha round and negotiate 'new issues', notably electronic commerce, as part of a broader US-led strategy to rewrite the global trade rules for the 21st century. Developing countries insist the Doha round be concluded before considering new issues and most reject the e-commerce agenda as foreclosing their options for digital development. This standoff dominated the MC11. The new e-commerce agenda has its genesis in the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Three factors complicate moves to export it to the WTO. First, those rules are blunt instruments designed to protect the first mover status and oligopolistic power of Big Tech. Second, they lack any development flexibilities or obligations. Third, their application to major developing country competitors and the potentially lucrative markets of larger developing countries requires multilateralization through the WTO, but that will be a highly contested process. That contest is now playing out through the plurilateral process announced by the e-commerce proponents during the MC11. The proposals assume a major expansion of Members' commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Favourable interpretations of sectoral classifications, modes of trading services, and the application of technological neutrality to historical commitments would override the original GATS acquis that ensures developing countries can control their exposure, and seriously diminish their regulatory autonomy to maximize the opportunities of the digital economy and minimize the risks. Such an agenda could deepen the crisis at the WTO.","[Kelsey, Jane] Univ Auckland, Fac Law, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Kelsey, J (corresponding author), Univ Auckland, Fac Law, Auckland, New Zealand.",j.kelsey@auckland.ac.nz,,,Marsden Fund grant from the Royal Society of New Zealand; IDB-INTAL,Marsden Fund grant from the Royal Society of New Zealand(Royal Society of New ZealandMarsden Fund (NZ)); IDB-INTAL,This research was partially supported by a Marsden Fund grant from the Royal Society of New Zealand and a travel grant from the IDB-INTAL to present the paper at the MC11 think Track in Buenos Aires in December 2017.,,94,15,16,1,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1369-3034,1464-3758,,J INT ECON LAW,J.

In general, we see a huge under-utilized potential in the digitalization - of business, regardless of regional specifics.","[Tolstykh, Tatyana O.] Ind Managment Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow, Russia; [Shkarupeta, Elena, V; Shishkin, Igor A.; Dudareva, Olga, V; Golub, Natalia N.] Voronezh State Tech Univ, Voronezh, Russia",Voronezh State Technical University,"Tolstykh, TO (corresponding author), Ind Managment Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow, Russia.",tt400@mail.ru; 79056591561@mail.ru; i-11223344@mail.ru; dudarevaov@mail.ru; bas1971@list.ru,"Dudareva, Olga/AAI-5697-2021; Shkarupeta, Elena/Q-4229-2017; Tolstykh, Tatyana Олеговны/HZI-2559-2023","Dudareva, Olga/0000-0001-8447-6273; Shkarupeta, Elena/0000-0003-3644-4239; Tolstykh, Tatyana Олеговны/0000-0002-4386-9684",,,,,10,15,15,4,24,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-5357,2194-5365,978-3-319-75383-6; 978-3-319-75382-9,ADV INTELL SYST,,,2018,622,,,,,,736,743,,10.1007/978-3-319-75383-6_94,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-75383-6_94,,,8,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BP9OU,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000570135200093,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given increasingly challenging carbon reduction targets, the role of information and communication technology and the digital economy are increasingly championed as offering potential to contribute to meeting these targets within cities and buildings. This paper questions the faith being placed in smart or intelligent solutions through asking, what role then for the ordinary citizen? The smart approach often appears to have a narrow view of how technology and user-engagement can sit together, viewing the behaviour of users as a hurdle to overcome rather than a resource to be utilised. This paper suggests lessons can be learnt from other disciplines and wider sustainable development policy that champions the role of citizens and user-engagement to harness the co-creation of knowledge, collaboration and empowerment. Specifically, empirical findings and observations are presented from a case study of citizen engagement around an energy-from-waste infrastructure development. Recommendations are provided for engineers, planners and decision makers in order to help plan more effective engagement strategies for citizens, building users and stakeholders.","[Bull, Richard] De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Leicester, Leics, England; [Azennoud, Marouane] Northamptonshire Cty Council, Northampton, England",De Montfort University,"Bull, R (corresponding author), De Montfort Univ, Inst Energy & Sustainable Dev, Leicester, Leics, England.",rbull@dmu.ac.uk,,", Richard/0000-0002-4372-3589",,,,,29,15,16,2,73,ICE PUBLISHING,WESTMINISTER,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",1751-4223,1751-4231,,P I CIVIL ENG-ENERGY,Proc.

The logic of the new dynamics is related to the importance of regions or places in the space of flows and in the creation and transfer of knowledge in the Internet era. It is clear that most of the flows are directional and are grounded in physical places via material flows and social relations. Place becomes even more important in the era of the digital economy, due to the need for spatial proximity in the transfer of tacit knowledge. Three major patterns can be identified. First, innovation centers and knowledge-intensive service centers have been newly developed in the Asian Pacific Rim. Second, regional innovation systems are emerging in some of the major metropolitan areas of this part of the world, while diverse types of regional innovation systems have been developed with the restructuring of existing innovation centers and newly emerging innovation clusters. Third, diverse city regions have been developed and interactions between both sides of the Pacific Rim will be strengthened through business networks and innovation networks.","Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, Seoul 151742, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Park, SO (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Geog, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",,,,,,,,72,15,17,1,18,SPRINGER-VERLAG,NEW YORK,"175 FIFTH AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10010 USA",1056-8190,,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

J,"Sung, HC",,,,"Sung, Huang-Chih",,,Can Online Courts Promote Access to Justice? A Case Study of the Internet Courts in China,COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,online court; blockchain; copyright infringement; blockchain-based evidence,CHALLENGES,"The right to access the courts is a basic human right in civilised societies, but the current le-gal system is unfriendly and often unaffordable for the victims of e-commerce disputes and copyright infringements seeking access to justice. Therefore, how to design a judicial system that is more accessible for the aforementioned victims has become a critical legal point of contention in the digital economy era. In particular, it is not easy to provide solid evidence of consumer disputes or copyright infringements on the Internet because the electronic evidence stored on the current centralised database has data security and trust problems. In response to this challenge, China established three Internet Courts in 2017 to move dispute resolution for e-commerce disputes and copyright infringements from the physical courts to the Internet. All the proceedings in these Internet Courts are conducted on the Internet, so the time and expenses of the litigants can be largely reduced. Most notably, these In-ternet Courts accept the use of blockchain as a method of securing evidence, to overcome the risks that evidence stored on the Internet can be hacked or falsified. The notion of an Internet Court, which substantially enhances popular access to justice, is a significant judicial innovation. It is of special significance for those lawsuits with small value claims and online evidence, and in which the parties are separated by long distances. However, these Internet Courts leave much to reflect on, including whether due process can be guaranteed, whether public trial can be fully implemented, and whether blockchain-based evidence is absolutely admissible. Even so, this article argues that true justice is not only to pursue absolute correctness of judgements, but that true justice should also strike a balance between the correctness and efficiency of trials. For this reason, Internet Courts may yet establish a new judicial paradigm to pursue a balance between correctness, time, and cost. (C) 2020 Huang-Chih Sung. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These particular sectors of the creative industries are rapidly becoming energizing vehicles for transmedia intellectual property (IP) - referring to a network of interconnected media, popular culture and merchandise emanating from a single creative source. Specifically, South Korean webtoons and Chinese webnovels are cultivating new audiences and participatory cultures beyond their Asian borders, and thus playing a significant economic role in the percentage of global GDP that the broader cultural and creative industries generate annually. To shed light on how this phenomenon is shifting various modes of production, this study analyses how a range of active fans, otherwise known as 'cultural intermediaries', have moved to the forefront of creative industry transformations while building trust among their followers and demonstrating loyalties with the platforms on which they circulate their user-created content. Taken together, the webtoons and webnovels explored highlight some of the complex impacts and tensions on the production, circulation, and translation of popular digital media in an increasingly participatory and decentralised online and mobile environments.

Nowadays, digital education is one of the priorities of state policy in modern Russia. The Federal Institute for the Development of Education has developed a draft didactic concept of digital education to maximise the potential of digital technology (DT) in vocational training. Nevertheless, while policymakers and education managers are aware of the need to move to a new level of digital technology implementation, there are challenges to this process. The technological resources of educational environment have been increasing intensively in the past decade, and their intensive scientific and pedagogical development is observed. However, little attention is given to the willingness of teachers to work with continuously evolving technological tools. The aim of the research is to identify the barriers, which hinder the professional development of teachers in mastering information and communications technologies (ICT) and digital technologies, as well as some mental attitudes circulating in the society and slowing down the process of digitalisation of vocational education. Methodology and research methods. The present research is based on personal-context and personal-development approaches. In the course of experimental research and two pilot studies, teachers and specialists of professional educational organisations were interviewed (n = 187 people). The methods of questionnaire-based survey, sociological analysis, statistical data-processing tools and Google Forms tools were used. Results and scientific novelty. On the basis of the outcomes of the conducted surveys, the following aspects were analysed: the degree of teachers' skills formation declared in the professional standard; willingness to implement e-learning, expand the range of ICT and GT included in teaching practice; respondents' attitudes towards the digitalisation of education and their self-recognition in this process. Clear and invisible obstacles to the process under discussion are identified and sistematised. The found barriers are classified into risk, image and didactic barriers. The recommendations to overcome the barriers are proposed. According to the authors of the present article, it is advisable to introduce a new specialty digital engineer-teacher due to the obvious integration of pedagogical and engineering functions into the activities of teachers. Working in one team consisted of a specialist, who designs an effective teaching environment, and a teacher-didactist, will reduce a part of unjustified functional workload of the latter. Practical significance. The materials of the undertaken research have significant implications for further development of perceptions of the essence and content of digital didactics; justification and formation of optimal conditions for digitalisation of vocational education, including psychological and pedagogical adjustment of the system of training and retraining of pedagogical and managerial personnel for the digital economy.","[Andryukhina, L.

Hence, this paper analyses legal framework on regulation of false content online in Malaysia and selected jurisdictions. In particular, three recent initiatives were also highlighted, namely (1) introduction of a website - 'Sebenarnya.my' designed to verify authenticity of news; (2) emplacing liability on WhatsApp group administrator to monitor false content; and enactment of the Anti-Fake News Act 2018. The extent of how far these new initiatives to effectively curb the spread of false content is yet to be seen. Nevertheless, the paper records some key observations, issues and challenges concerning the three initiatives.

In fact, the evaluation process, the indicators that the EU produces and uses to this aim, how it measures states? performance in this field are all relevant issues mirroring the idea of (digital) Europe that the EU intends to build. Drawing on previous studies that have emphasised the political aspects of measurement and the governmentality power of indicators, the authors maintain that the way the EU measures the implementation of digital policies reflects a neoliberal vision of what a digital Europe should look like; furthermore, through rankings and ratings, the EU exerts a governmentality power on member states by conducting their behaviour at a distance. After introducing the theme, the study deepens the political dimension of evaluation and unfolds its crucial connection with neoliberalisation. Then it focuses on the European case, with a qualitative content analysis of the indicators included in three datasets that the European Commission has created over time: the Digital Agenda Key Indicators (DAKI), the Lead indicators for DG Connect policy priorities, and the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI). The article ends with some remarks about the kind of digital Europe promoted by indicators.","[Giannone, Diego] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Polit Sci Jean Monnet, Polit Sci, Caserta, CE, Italy; [Santaniello, Mauro] Univ Salerno, Dept Polit Social & Commun Sci, Fisciano, SA, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Salerno,"Giannone, D (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Polit Sci Jean Monnet, Viale Ellitt 31, I-81100 Caserta, CE, Italy.",diego.giannone@unicampania.it,"Giannone, Diego/AAU-5837-2021","Giannone, Diego/0000-0002-6847-5219; SANTANIELLO, MAURO/0000-0001-5582-622X",,,,,44,14,15,8,58,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

At the same time, the growing relevance of entrepreneurship in digital fields is underlined. This paper argues that this is contradictory since territorial thinking underestimates the disruptive qualities of new entrepreneurial practices in the digital economy. Using process-based, qualitative case studies on seed accelerators from four regions: Amsterdam, Berlin, Detroit and Hamburg, this study seeks to explore knowledge brokering in entrepreneurship ecosystems and analyzes the corresponding spatial dynamics. Our findings imply that startups in digital fields share knowledge about business models and technologies in a way that is unattainable in classical knowledge clusters. Moreover, we show that most of the observed entrepreneurial practices in seed accelerators crucially rely on extra-regional resources and thus remain only incompletely embedded into the respective regions. Against the background of these results, we suggest that entrepreneurial ecosystems should not be primarily viewed as territorial phenomena. Instead, we suggest that the territorial view on entrepreneurship ecosystems should be complemented with a topological view that foregrounds entrepreneurship as a trans-locally shared practice that is tangent to different regions in different ways.","[Kuebart, Andreas; Ibert, Oliver] Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Erkner, Germany; [Kuebart, Andreas; Ibert, Oliver] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus Senftenberg, Postfach 101344, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Raumbezogene Sozialforschung (IRS); Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus,"Kuebart, A (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Erkner, Germany.;Kuebart, A (corresponding author), Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus Senftenberg, Postfach 101344, D-03013 Cottbus, Germany.",andreas.kuebart@leibniz-irs.de; oliver.ibert@leibniz-irs.de,"Kuebart, Andreas/AAT-8645-2020","Kuebart, Andreas/0000-0003-1972-5776","Leibniz-Institute for Research on Society and Space (IRS) in Erkner, Germany","Leibniz-Institute for Research on Society and Space (IRS) in Erkner, Germany","This paper emerged out of the project institutionally funded lead-project Local anchors of translocal knowledge communities: New focal points of knowledge generation and their territoriality conducted from 2015 to 2018 at the Leibniz-Institute for Research on Society and Space (IRS) in Erkner, Germany.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive and large-scale analysis of 6,843 pornographic websites. We provide an exhaustive behavioral analysis of the use of tracking methods by these websites, and their lack of regulatory compliance, including the absence of age-verification mechanisms and methods to obtain informed user consent. The results indicate that, as in the regular web, tracking is prevalent across pornographic sites: 72% of the websites use third-party cookies and 5% leverage advanced user fingerprinting technologies. Yet, our analysis reveals a third-party tracking ecosystem semi-decoupled from the regular web in which various analytics and advertising services track users across, and outside, pornographic websites. We complete the paper with a regulatory compliance analysis in the context of the EU GDPR, and newer legal requirements to implement verifiable access control mechanisms (e.g., UK's Digital Economy Act). We find that only 16% of the analyzed websites have an accessible privacy policy and only 4% provide a cookie consent banner.

However, the distribution of these significant social and economic benefits among the various stakeholders in the cloud ecosystem will critically depend on pricing and resource allocation decisions made by cloud providers. These decisions impact not only the provider revenue, but also the fairness of resources allocated among cloud users and the overall social welfare. Several unique features of cloud computing (e.g., the presence of multiple, nonfungible resources and heterogeneous users) make the interplay between these competing objectives hard to understand. To truly harness the power of cloud computing and to establish regulatory benchmarks, there is a need for frameworks that quantify how resource allocation and pricing choices affect different objectives. In this work, we introduce an analytical model that incorporates user utility, endogenous pricing, fairness among heterogeneous users, social welfare, and cloud provider revenue. We identify conditions under which there is a tradeoff between fairness and revenue, and quantify the extent of this tradeoff by formulating an optimization problem in which a cloud provider maximizes its revenue, subject to constraints on the desired level of fairness. Our work provides an initial step toward developing regulatory policies for cloud neutrality to ensure an equitable distribution of the transformative benefits of the cloud.","[Joe-Wong, Carlee] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Sen, Soumya] Univ Minnesota, Informat & Decis Sci, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Sen, S (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Informat & Decis Sci, Carlson Sch Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",cjoewong@andrew.cmu.edu; ssen@umn.edu,,,,,,,53,14,16,0,50,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0742-1222,1557-928X,,J MANAGE INFORM SYST,J.

The digitalization of work has progressively allowed businesses to outsource IT-enabled service jobs to cheaper production sites offshore. The growth of the offshore outsourcing' of white-collar service jobs in East Asia has produced the mobility of cheap digital labour from Japan to Dalian in northeast China. They work at call centres and other Japanese-speaking workplaces in the lower echelons of the city's IT sector, typically earning salaries in Chinese yuan at, or even below, the average Japanese minimum wage. Based on ethnographic findings, I argue that in the global digital economy, digital services are rendered exploitable through their transnational mobility and that this form of labour migration has developed because of the partial, fluid and contingent nature of the transnational links between the two locations. I analyse how the neoliberal logic of exception underpins the creation of IT parks in China and the casualization of labour in Japan to enable new forms of transnational labour control and capital accumulation.","[Kawashima, Kumiko] Macquarie Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Sociol, Sydney, NSW 2019, Australia",Macquarie University,"Kawashima, K (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Fac Arts, Dept Sociol, Sydney, NSW 2019, Australia.",kumiko.kawashima@mq.edu.au,,", Kumiko/0000-0001-5741-4165",,,,,63,14,14,5,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1470-2266,1471-0374,,GLOBAL NETW,Glob.

The data economy has triggered controversies regarding the intersection between EU competition law and data protection law. This article embarks on a conceptual analysis of fairness, and tests the hypothesis that there exist commonalities between the two fields of law. The hypothesis is based on the fact that both competition and data protection law make explicit reference to the concept of fairness in defining infringements, and that EU law in general terms is subordinate to the principle of coherence. The article concludes, however, that although the concept is, to some extent, applied coherently in the two fields, its ability to offer legal certainty for the actors in the digital economy remains limited unless and until the administrative and judicial authorities elaborate its precise contents more fully.

I explain the novelty of open innovation, its genealogy, and the implications for people and conditions of work as much as for firms in a new topolbgy of power relations. I cast the ensemble of strategies and tactics encompassed in open innovation as contingent, continually unfolding, and sometimes chaotic if not destructive for both firms and labor, in contrast to the celebratory tone in the business as well as geography and regional studies literatures regarding its benefits for competitiveness, innovativeness, value capture, and development. Open innovation- the externalization of innovation - entails long-run approaches to innovation and investment that are fraught with problems, prompting the development of short-term tactics to engage the challenges. One short-run strategy, crowdsourcing, bypasses the conventional web of inter-firm relations to connect digitally With individuals of the global crowd, enabling firms to reap the benefits of the crowd's innovative talents, often without remuneration under circumstances that institutionalize informal work. These neoliberal subjects are best understood in terms of multiple subjectivities.

While the global sourcing of activities in the development of digital assets is widespread, very little is known about how location-related factors may affect confidentiality outcomes. Addressing this, we empirically investigate two factors with rich theoretical bases and logical linkages to confidentiality: industrial agglomeration and national property rights protections. We conduct a large-scale, empirical study at the product level of analysis, and treat the confidentiality of a digital product as a performance outcome that is affected by the locations of the two key organizational entities involved in the product's development. We leverage modern, web-crawling methods to harvest secondary data from a major, illicit distribution channel for these products and combine these data with other secondary data involving legitimate commerce to derive a secondary measure of confidentiality performance. We find robust results, and demonstrate practical significance of our findings through scenario analyses based on actual data from our sample.","[Massimino, Brett] Cornell Univ, Cornell Coll Business, 340 Statler Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Gray, John V.; Boyer, Kenneth K.] Ohio State Univ, Fisher Coll Business, 2100 Neil Ave, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Cornell University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Massimino, B (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Cornell Coll Business, 340 Statler Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",bjm272@cornell.edu; gray.402@osu.edu; boyer.9@osu.edu,"Boyer, Kenneth K/E-9025-2010","Gray, John/0000-0002-0212-5654","Joseph Research Center at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota; Center for International Business Education and Research at Ohio State's Fisher College of Business","Joseph Research Center at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota; Center for International Business Education and Research at Ohio State's Fisher College of Business","A portion of this research was supported by a Fellowship from the Joseph Research Center at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota.

Because online data can be persistent and immense, e-learning researchers and educators should advise people to make constructive use of online data and to disclose the data with caution. However, few studies have indicated that data protection issues are particular concerns in e-learning practices. Drawing on a systematic literature review, this paper examines personal data protection issues related to instructional design and e learning. We aim to understand the online data protection-related issues that instructors or instructional designers encounter rather than reiterating that users must be aware of the informative and persistent characteristics of online data. The themes that emerged from the literature review can be classified into two typologies. One typology refers to the identification of privacy issues as a particular concern in the instructional design of e learning, and the second typology is the implementation of data protection as a subject matter in the pedagogical design for e-learning. The results of the review and their implications for further research are then discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The previous Australian Government, through the national Digital Economy Strategy, invested heavily in telehealth service development, at the same time introducing a carbon pricing mechanism. In planning a range of new telehealth services to a rural community the authors sought to quantify the travel conducted by people from one rural area in Australia to access health care, and to calculate the associated carbon emissions. Methods: A population survey was conducted over a 1-week period of health-related travel events for the year 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 of all households on King Island, a community situated between the Australian mainland state of Victoria and the state of Tasmania. Validated emissions calculators were sourced from the Carbon Neutral website, including the vehicle and fuel use calculator and air travel carbon calculator, to calculate the total emissions associated with the fuel burned in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e). Results: Thirty nine percent of the population (625 participants) reported a total of 511 healthcare-related travel events. Participants travelled a total of 346 573 km and generated 0.22 tCO2e per capita. Participants paid the cost of their own travel more than 70% of the time. Conclusions: Dependence on fossil fuels for transport in a carbon economy has a significant impact on total healthcare carbon emissions. Alternative models of care, such as telehealth, need be developed for an environmentally sustainable healthcare system for rural and remote areas.","[Ellis, I.; Cheek, C.; Jaffray, L.] Univ Tasmania, Burnie, Tas 7320, Australia; [Skinner, T.

This paper examines the reality of ICT exploitation by rural business across Europe, based on a survey of 600 enterprises in 12 regions located in Ireland, Scotland, Germany, Spain, Greece and Finland. Not surprisingly, a range of outcomes has been identified in terms of telecommunications infrastructure and ICT usage, which reflect considerable differences in access to reasonably priced broadband telecommunications, awareness of how the technologies can be exploited, and in levels of skills to translate that exploitation into a means of competitiveness.","Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Galway, Dept Geog, Galway, Ireland; Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Galway, Ctr Innovat & Struct Change, Galway, Ireland",Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Galway, Dept Geog, Galway, Ireland.",seamus.grimes@nuigalway.ie,"Grimes, Seamus/AAH-6854-2019","Grimes, Seamus/0000-0002-9686-5900",,,,,32,14,15,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

The actual extent of e-commerce use, however, is still very limited, as diffusion is hindered by both the low income levels of most Mexican households and the fact that the overwhelming majority of business establishments are very small, lacking the resources to invest in computers and the business culture to go online. This article examines the emergence of e-commerce in Mexico arguing that the main drivers of the process have been the initiatives of large private firms and the work of specialized organizations. It concludes that this is not just a passing boom but a concrete step toward the rise of an Internet-based economy in Mexico along the lines of the New Economy that took shape in the United States in the 1990s and is assumed to spread into developing nations.","Univ Guadalajara, S Coast Univ Ctr, Autlan de Navarro 48900, Jalisco, Mexico",Universidad de Guadalajara,"Univ Guadalajara, S Coast Univ Ctr, Av Independencia Nacl 151, Autlan de Navarro 48900, Jalisco, Mexico.",jjpalacios@cucsur.udg.mx,,,,,,,41,14,17,2,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0197-2243,1087-6537,,INFORM SOC,Inf.

To solve this problem, first we establish a digital economy indicator evaluation system by dividing the digital economy into four types: basic type, technology type, integration type and service type and select 5 indicators for each type. On this basis, the weight of each indicator is calculated to find the deficiencies in the development of some digital economic fields by the improved entropy method. By drawing on the empowerment idea of Analytic Hierarchy Process, the improved entropy method firstly compares the difference coefficient of indicators in pairs and maps the comparison results to the scales 1-9. Then, the judgment matrix is constructed based on the information entropy, which can solve as much as possible the problem that the difference among the weight of each indicator is too large in traditional entropy method. The results indicate that: the development of digital economy in Guangdong Province was relatively balanced from 2015 to 2018 and will be better in the future while the development of rural e-commerce in Guangdong Province is relatively backward, and there is an obvious digital gap between urban and rural areas. Next we extract two new variables respectively to replace the 20 indicators we select through principal component analysis and factor analysis methods in multivariate statistical analysis, which can retain the original information to the greatest extent and provide convenience for further research in the future. Finally, we and provide constructive comments of digital economy in Guangdong Province from 2015 to 2018.","[Deng, Xue; Liu, Yuying; Xiong, Ye] South China Univ Technol, Sch Math, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China",South China University of Technology,"Deng, X (corresponding author), South China Univ Technol, Sch Math, Guangzhou 510640, Peoples R China.",dxue@scut.edu.cn; 18785609808@163.com; workyep@163.com,,,"Humanities and Social Sciences Research and Planning Fund of the Ministry of Education of China [18YJAZH014-x2lxY9180090]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2019A1515011038]; Soft Science of Guangdong Province [2018A070712006, 2019A101002118]; Guangdong Graduate Education Innovation Program [2019SFKC07]",Humanities and Social Sciences Research and Planning Fund of the Ministry of Education of China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Soft Science of Guangdong Province; Guangdong Graduate Education Innovation Program,"This research was funded by Humanities and Social Sciences Research and Planning Fund of the Ministry of Education of China, grant number 18YJAZH014-x2lxY9180090; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, grant number 2019A1515011038; Soft Science of Guangdong Province, grant number 2018A070712006, 2019A101002118; Guangdong Graduate Education Innovation Program, grant number 2019SFKC07.",,22,13,13,9,112,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,DEC,2020,22,12,,,,,,,1441,10.3390/e22121441,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e22121441,,,21,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,PJ9OH,33419351,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000602086700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

From an environmental macro perspective, at the national level, a simple linear regression has been performed between the DESI and mean sitting time per country. To develop a micro approach to this phenomenon, binomial logistic regression models have been run among individual e-devices ownership and the daily amount of time spent sitting (<= 3.5 h/day, > 4.5 h/day). Digital country development is positively related to sitting time, whereas the ownership of e-device (either DVD player, CD player, desk computer, laptop, and Internet connection) was associated with a higher sitting time (>4.5 h/day) in the overall population, with slight differences by gender. While further research is needed to understand the effect of digitalization on sedentary behaviour throughout time, here we document how it is associated with higher sitting time, as assessed through both macro and micro approaches.","[Moreno-Llamas, Antonio; Garcia-Mayor, Jesus; De la Cruz-Sanchez, Ernesto] Univ Murcia, Fac Sport Sci, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"De la Cruz-Sánchez, E (corresponding author), Univ Murcia, Campus San Javier,C Santa Alicia S-N, Murcia 30720, Spain.",erneslacruz@um.es,"Moreno-Llamas, Antonio/C-2946-2019; De la Cruz-Sánchez, Ernesto/F-7406-2010","Moreno-Llamas, Antonio/0000-0003-0168-4806; De la Cruz-Sánchez, Ernesto/0000-0002-4718-7058; Garcia-Mayor, Jesus/0000-0002-7212-1974",,,,,37,13,14,1,17,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

The question is whether alternative imaginaries and typologies of digital entrepreneurship can be included in how we view digital entrepreneurship order to stimulate new practices and imagined futures. Our case studies of digital entrepreneurs in a number of African cities illustrate that popular and academic spatial imaginaries and discourses, for example those that cast the digital economy as borderless and accessible, do not correspond with the experience of many African entrepreneurs. Furthermore, enacting the metaphoric identities that coincide with these imaginaries and their discourses is a skillset that determines which (and how) actors can participate. They reflect the inherent coloniality of the digital, capitalist discourse. The tendency in the digital economy is to regard the entrepreneur persona, as realistic and global, rather than performative and particular to the Euro-American context in which these personas have originated. Our interviews of 186 digital entrepreneurs demonstrate that digital imaginaries and metaphors cannot be neutral and apolitical. In order to be inclusive, they should evoke a sense of multiplicity, heterogeneity and contingency.","[Wahome, Michel] Univ Strathclyde, Sch Law, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Graham, M.] Univ Oxford, Oxford Internet Inst, Oxford, England",University of Strathclyde; University of Oxford,"Wahome, M (corresponding author), Univ Strathclyde, Sch Law, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.",michel.wahome@strath.ac.uk,,"Wahome, Michel Njeri/0000-0002-8524-210X",H2020 European Research Council,H2020 European Research Council(Horizon 2020European Research Council (ERC)),This work was supported by H2020 European Research Council.,,59,13,16,6,66,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-118X,1468-4462,,INFORM COMMUN SOC,Info.

In the article, we discuss and define the essence of the phenomenon of digital economp Digital technologies, introduced into socio-economic and technological processes, will certainly be involved in the generation of the value added of the final product (service), regardless of its purpose (type of activity and sector of the economy). Although information and communication products belong to the information and communication technology (10) sector, each economic activity develops, implements and uses its own solutions in the field of ICT, digital labour and digital capital, which are not directly analysed and measured. In this regard, there is a need to improve approaches to assessing and measuring the volume of the digital economy at different territorial levels, including regional economies. We propose a methodology for measuring the digital economy at the regional level and test it, using the economic and statistical analysis of data for the Perm region of Russia. We have structured the digital economy in the region and identified the core of ICT, the outer tier of ICT and the digital sector outside of ICT. We have discovered it appropriate to measure the digital economy of a region or a country through a system of indicators: ICT costs, the number and share of employment in the digital economy, the volume and share of digital production in the economy, digital labour force, digital production capacity.","[Mirolyubova, T., V; Karlina, T., V; Nikolaev, R.

This format collapses social inequality into a spectacle of money flowing and vanishing on screen.

Its R&D investment was double that of 2015, five times that of 2012, and ten times that of 2011. Such a rapid and notable increase in R&D investment has raised the question of a new R&D definition and focus in the digital economy, which Amazon insists includes both routine or periodic alterations (traditionally classified as non-R&D) and significant improvement (classified as R&D). Using an empirical analysis of Amazon's R&D model as a system, this paper attempts to provide a convincing answer to this question. It has been identified that Amazon, which is based on R&D as a culture, has been promoting company wide experimentation to cause customers obsessed with making purchase decisions. This obsession has enabled Amazon to deploy an architecture for participation that makes the most of digital technologies by harnessing the power of users. Such user-driven innovation has accelerated a dramatic advancement of the Internet that, in turn, has accelerated the co-emergence of soft innovation resources in the marketplace. This emergence has activated a self-propagating function that has induced functionality development, leading to supra-functionality beyond an economic value that satisfies a shift in customers' preferences. While this system depends on the assimilation capacity of soft innovation resources, Amazon has developed a high level of capacity supported by a rapid and notable increase in R&D investment. The above efforts function in a virtuous cycle leading to the transformation of routine or periodic alterations into significant improvement. These findings give rise to insightful suggestions regarding a new concept of R&D in neo open innovation in the digital economy.","[Tou, Yuji] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Tokyo, Japan; [Watanabe, Chihiro; Moriya, Kuniko; Naveed, Nasir; Neittaanmaki, Pekka] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Watanabe, Chihiro] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Moriya, Kuniko] Bank Japan, Res & Stat Dept, Tokyo, Japan; [Vurpillat, Victor] Global Connexus Inc, San Jose, CA USA",Tokyo Institute of Technology; University of Jyvaskyla; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Bank of Japan,"Watanabe, C (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",watanabe.c.pqr@gmail.com,,,Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [293446],Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland,"The research leading to these results is part of a project: Platform Value Now: Value capturing in fast-emerging platform ecosystems, supported by the Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [grant number 293446].",,67,13,13,5,37,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

In particular, there has been much debate about workers' motivations and working conditions on microtask platforms. There exists little evidence on whether dependence on digital microtask platforms provides workers with work and income security in the long term and whether it provides opportunities for skill development. This paper explores the extent to which the seemingly flexible platform work ensures work and income security and provides opportunities for skill development for workers with different levels of experience, based on novel survey data collected on five globally operating microtask platforms and in-depth interviews with workers. The findings show that despite high financial dependence on this work, returns to experience on the platform are meagre in terms of earnings, and highly experienced workers face the same risks as new entrants with regard to discrimination, high work intensity, lack of autonomy and control over work, and social protection. There is also a skills gap between the nature of tasks available on these microtask platforms and the workers' education levels. Finally, experience does not ensure that workers have the opportunities to undertake complex and challenging tasks, and the possibilities to develop their skills and improve career prospects are limited.","[Rani, Uma; Furrer, Marianne] Int Labor Org, Route Morillons 4, CH-1211 Geneva 22, Switzerland",,"Rani, U (corresponding author), Int Labor Org, Route Morillons 4, CH-1211 Geneva 22, Switzerland.",amara@ilo.org; furrer@ilo.org,"Rani, Uma/X-1714-2019",,,,,,53,13,14,4,55,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The wide use of the term has, however, led to a loss of specificity in the way it is used. Across several disciplines the commons is often used almost interchangeably with terms such as open access, common property, public domain, public goods, or common pool resources. We examine the reasons for the increasing conflation of these concepts over time. The field emerged as the result of the collaboration of two types of theoretical work: a) the study of common pool resources which focused on the characteristics of the resources in order to predict social behaviour, and b) research on the analysis of common property regimes that focused on the structural characteristics of the institutions devised to manage those resources. This difference in emphasis resulted in the development of two sets of concepts to refer to the same processes but from slightly different perspectives. With increasing interest in research focussed on the commons, these concepts are often used uncritically and their original designations are conflated across a suite of categories.","[Vaccaro, Ismael] McGill Univ, Dept Anthropol, 855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Vaccaro, Ismael] McGill Univ, McGill Sch Environm, 855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada; [Beltran, Oriol] Univ Barcelona, Fac Geog & Hist, Dept Antropol Social, Montalegre 6, Barcelona 08001, Spain",McGill University; McGill University; University of Barcelona,"Vaccaro, I (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Anthropol, 855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.;Vaccaro, I (corresponding author), McGill Univ, McGill Sch Environm, 855 Sherbrooke St West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T7, Canada.",Ismael.vaccaro@mcgill.ca; obeltran@ub.edu,,"Vaccaro, Ismael/0000-0002-7551-4845",,,,,102,13,16,0,15,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0300-7839,1572-9915,,HUM ECOL,Hum.

The rapid development of the digital economy at the national and worldwide levels in recent decades has accelerated processes of transformation of financial systems and led to financialiation of the global economy. FinTech companies operating in the financial market represent a new, quite special category of parabank institutions. They are characterised by the implementation of modern technologies to develop and provide traditional financial services. It would not be possible to provide such services without the Internet and digitalisation, compatibility of electronic devices, including hardware and software, nor would it become possible without new experiences, skills and consumer confidence. This is a kind of analogy with search engines that have changed the architecture of the market and mediation and led to the transformation of business models of financial market entities, in particular banks. Purpose. This paper presents the results of the possibility of providing financial services without banks. It determines the main aspects of competition and directions of combining FinTech and banking. Methods. In evaluation the FinTech and banking sectors, the authors have used statistical monitoring, as well as dynamic, comparative and structural analysis. Results. The results of the study show that FinTech allows creating new services that are not provided by traditional financial intermediaries. It has been proven that the limits for FinTech companies to avoid banking rules and regulations are expanding, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to prove that this is happening beyond the law or outside the law. An analysis of the global trends in the development of the FinTech industry has shown that the volume of investments in this area in 2018 was USD 111.8 billion, which is almost 6 times more than in 2013. The authors examine the main forms of interaction between banks and FinTech companies. Basic models of banks' participation in the creation of FinTech companies are substantiated. The authors of the article have analysed characteristics of the largest FinTech accelerators, identified and characterised the main risks and opportunities relating to FinTech for the banking and consumer sectors. Conclusions. The presented paper reveals the modern trends in FinTech development. They should be taken into account in defining the key determinants of the transformation of the banking sector in relation to the formation of new business models of banks with regard to the challenges of digitalisation.","[Zveryakov, Mikhail] NAS Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine; [Zveryakov, Mikhail; Kovalenko, Victoria; Sheludko, Sergii; Sharah, Elena] Odessa Natl Econ Univ, 8 Preobrazhenska Str, UA-65082 Odessa, Ukraine",National Academy of Sciences Ukraine; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Odessa National Economic University,"Zveryakov, M (corresponding author), NAS Ukraine, Kiev, Ukraine.;Zveryakov, M (corresponding author), Odessa Natl Econ Univ, 8 Preobrazhenska Str, UA-65082 Odessa, Ukraine.",rector@oneu.edu.ua; kovalenko-6868@ukr.net; sergshell@ukr.net; sharah_elena@ukr.net,"Kovalenko, Victoria V.V./B-4996-2015; Zvieriakov, M.I./B-1523-2015; Sheludko, Sergii/H-4614-2016; Sharag, Elena/B-1541-2015","Zvieriakov, M.I./0000-0003-0039-5068; Sheludko, Sergii/0000-0003-0636-4940; Zveryakov, Michail/0000-0002-3591-7201; Sharag, Elena/0000-0002-0530-798X",,,,,26,13,15,14,108,INST SOC TRANSFORMATION,KYIV,"VUL GONCHARA 43-V, OFIS 20, KYIV, 01030, UKRAINE",1728-6220,1728-6239,,ECON ANN-XXI,Econ.

Design/methodology/approach This paper uses an analytical reference framework to assess the emergence of digital platforms in Russia, including four elements: definition of multi-sided platforms (MSPs), platform enablers, business models and competitive dynamics. Findings This paper concludes that Russia shows that a healthy competition between national and foreign MSPs led to the emergence of a shared equilibrium, where local platforms were able to retain a significant, often majority, share vis-a-vis foreign and global platforms. Practical implications -This case study offers practical data and analysis that can be used to create a baseline and evaluate the dynamics of digital platforms in emerging markets. It offers data, trends and evidence on Russia's digital economy. Social implications -This research provides a logical framework to help policymakers take decisions on a policy framework to regulate platforms in emerging markets. The good outcome of competition between local and foreign platforms should emerge as a policy objective to achieve in most emerging markets. Originality/value -This case study is the first baseline to assess the dynamics of competition between national and foreign digital platforms in the Russian market.

The impact of digitalization, domestically and in other Asian countries, is also explored. China's digital economy has grown rapidly since the end of the first decade of the 21st century, and compared to other countries with similar levels of economic development, China has a high rate of use of digital services. China's digitalization process is driven by both private companies and by the state's strategic initiatives, including social governance. China faces both opportunities and risks from digitalization. Workers in rural areas as well as older workers may face a higher risk of job loss through automation in the future. Chinese IT companies are eager to expand their activities both domestically and in foreign countries, and their investments in so-called unicorn companies in Southeast Asia are especially noteworthy.","[Ito, Asei] Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Ito, A (corresponding author), Univ Tokyo, Inst Social Sci, Tokyo, Japan.",,"Ito, Asei/GRF-2142-2022","Ito, Asei/0000-0003-1304-8583",,,,,45,13,13,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1343-9006,1469-2937,,ASIA-PAC REV,Asia-Pac.

The pricing of such intangibles is widely used to shift profits to low-tax countries. We analyze the implications of different OECD methods to regulate transfer pricing and the role of a source tax on royalty payments for abusive transfer pricing. First, we show that under the traditional transfer pricing methods mispricing of royalty payments does not affect investment behavior. In contrast, the Transactional Profit Split Method that is promoted by the OECD for evaluating firms in the digital economy triggers higher investment in order to facilitate higher profit shifting. Second, royalty taxation is effective in reducing (such) abusive profit shifting, but always reduces investment. Third, a royalty tax rate below the corporate tax rate leads to overinvestment in a tax system with allowance for corporate equity (ACE).","[Juranek, Steffen; Schindler, Dirk; Schjelderup, Guttorm] Norwegian Sch Econ, NoCeT, Bergen, Norway; [Schindler, Dirk; Schjelderup, Guttorm] CESifo, Bergen, Norway; [Juranek, Steffen; Schjelderup, Guttorm] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business Econ & Management Sci, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Schindler, Dirk] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Accounting Auditing & Law, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Juranek, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Sch Econ, NoCeT, Bergen, Norway.;Juranek, S (corresponding author), Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business Econ & Management Sci, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",Steffen.Juranek@nhh.no; Dirk.Schindler@nhh.no; Guttorm.Schjelderup@nhh.no,,"Juranek, Steffen/0000-0002-2882-1615; Schindler, Dirk/0000-0002-4254-6592",Norwegian Tax Administration; Research Council of Norway,Norwegian Tax Administration; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"We are grateful to participants at the conference on Tax Citizenship and Income Shifting at Notre Dame Global Gateway London, Japanese-Norwegian Workshop on Public Economics in Bergen, Skatteforum (tax forum) of the Research Council of Norway in Halden, and Research Seminar at the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition in Munich, as well as two anonymous referees and Francis Bloch (the Editor), for valuable comments.

The reasons are historical and include lack of sufficient performance of JavaScript, lack of camera support in the standard web APIs, and lack of comprehensive computer-vision libraries. These problems are about to get solved, resulting in the potential of an immersive and perceptual web with transformational effects including in online shopping, education, and entertainment among others. This work aims to enable web with computer vision by bringing hundreds of OpenCV functions to the open web platform.

Through the use of digital technologies, investments and innovations take place in the fields of smart grids, self-driving vehicles, e-government, advanced manufacturing, etc. Our research deals with the question whether there is any general or formalised technology which could be equally used in various fields, and which could help to achieve digitalisation in everyday life, also in the industry or in manufacturing. Digital transformation is the key of competitive sustainable development in the long term. As it has been noted by industrial players, the fourth industrial revolution is happening now. In the centre of technological change, the fusion of the physical and virtual world is taking place. With elaborated technological recommendations, digitalisation could be realised in an efficient way. With the help of intelligent cyber-physical systems, a holonic (with distributed intelligence) manufacturing technology will be developed. Smart cyber-physical systems can help to make human life better and more convenient by having features which cannot be found in traditional systems. Their use is easier not only because they are smaller and more efficient, but also because they have such system-level characteristics as autonomy, distributed intelligence, self-organisation or co-operation based on adaptivity.

It introduces new disciplines on issues such as cross-border data flows, online privacy, network neutrality, cybersecurity, regulation of spam, and safe harbour protection for internet intermediaries. These provisions are atypical of trade agreements, and are particularly significant as they have a direct impact on internet policy. In this article, I evaluate these new disciplines in the TPP to assess the extent to which the TPP is suitably placed in the internet eco-system. After a comprehensive legal assessment of these disciplines, I argue that the TPP does not effectively fit into the broader internet ecosystem, as it fails to synergize the goal of trade liberalization with important internet policy concerns such as facilitating trust of internet users and digital innovation. However, despite its deficiencies, the TPP sets a new benchmark for rules on digital trade, as its provisions address several contemporary issues in the digital economy. Therefore, the provisions on digital trade within the TPP will be instrumental in future negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other regional bodies. More importantly, the TPP is a reminder of the increasing significance of trade agreements in influencing critical aspects of internet policy. Particularly, in developing rules on digital trade that affect issues such as cross-border data flows, online privacy and consumer protection, net neutrality and cybersecurity, trade negotiators/lawyers need to comprehensively assess the relevance of these rules in the liberalization of digital trade, and its broader impact on the internet ecosystem.","[Mishra, Neha] Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Mishra, N (corresponding author), Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",nmishra@student.unimelb.edu.au,,,Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship,"Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science)",I gratefully acknowledge the support of the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship.

The paper presents results from a survey distributed to postgraduate information management and information systems students following completion of a module in E-Business and E-Commerce delivered by the Department of Information Studies at the University of Sheffield. The findings suggest that differences in levels of prior knowledge of business studies and in cultural background can impact on students' acquisition of domain knowledge and intellectual and information research skills during collaborative development of a business plan. Implications of the results for web-based instruction are addressed, by identifying teaching and learning strategies that support differential treatment of learners in terms of content and process.

Analysis methodology is the use of methods such as cross-cultural, systemic, synergetic, informational, axiological, cybernetic to develop a new model of the digital economy as a new scientific direction, in the context of which a new information space is being formed. The problems of solving the digital economy are taking place against the backdrop of new trends - globalization 4.0, Industry 4.0, Enlightenment 2.0, Agile management, in the context of which there is a transition from simple interconnection to hyperconnection and the spread of Moore's law, according to which there is a doubling of information. The results of the study. 1) The development of the digital economy as a new scientific field, which is based on a combination of concepts of informatization, digitalization, robotics, developing under the influence of global trends is studied. 2) It has been established that the digital economy contributes to technological progress and, under the pressure of global trends, develops a variety of economic models of scientific, technical and digital progress, which are based on the solution of problems of man, science, society. 3) The problematic issues of the digital economy and the conditions for its solution are identified. Conclusions. The prospects that the digital economy opens up thanks to modern technologies representing a technological breakthrough are analyzed. The digital technology network is designed so that it moves with the least loss and the smallest pieces of calculus are at the heart of this new constant flow system. All this indicates that in the context of globalization and the BIG DATA era, humanity is entering a new stage of calculus, when information doubles in accordance with Moore's law.","[Voronkova, Valentyna H.] Ukrainian Acad Polit Sci, Kiev, Ukraine; [Voronkova, Valentyna H.; Nikitenko, Vitalina A.] Zaporizhzhia Natl Univ, Dept Management Org & Project Management, Engn Inst, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine; [Teslenko, Tatyana, V] Dnepropetrovsk Natl Univ Railway Transport, Dept Econ & Management, Dnipro, Ukraine; [Bilohur, Vlada E.] Bogdan Khmelnitsky Melitopol State Pedag Univ, Dept Theory & Methodol Phys Educ & Sport Discipli, Melitopol, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Zaporizhzhia National University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Ukrainian State University of Science & Technologies; Bogdan Khmelnitsky Melitopol State Pedagogical University,"Voronkova, HV (corresponding author), Ukrainian Acad Polit Sci, Kiev, Ukraine.;Voronkova, HV (corresponding author), Zaporizhzhia Natl Univ, Dept Management Org & Project Management, Engn Inst, Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine.",,"Teslenko, Tetiana/HCH-1714-2022; Vitalina, Nikitenko/AAQ-5631-2021; Voronkova, Valentyna/T-2057-2017; Bilogur, Vlada/W-3957-2017","Vitalina, Nikitenko/0000-0001-9588-7836; Bilogur, Vlada/0000-0003-1053-2716; Teslenko, Tetana Viktorivna/0000-0002-5810-3569; , Bilohur Vlada/0009-0004-6056-1990",,,,,22,12,12,0,26,UNIV AMAZONIA,FLORENCE,"SEDE PRINCIPAL CALLE 17 DIAGONAL 17 CON CARRERA 3F-BARRIO PORVENIR, FLORENCE, 00000, COLOMBIA",,2322-6307,,AMAZON INVESTIG,AMAZON.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how it is possible to develop older employees' potential in technology use in the business environment. Design/methodology/approach The authors examined how employees at various age perceive barriers during enterprise system (ES) adoption and use. This exploratory study is based on grounded theory and draws from the opinions of 187 Polish ES practitioners. Findings With age, emphasis on employees' perception of mandatory ICT implementation projects is shifting from technology to people-related considerations. For older employees, job security and workload appear the most critical issues in such projects. Age-diverse collaboration appears necessary to address the problems posed by technology-related and demographic changes. Originality/value Unlike many prior studies, the current research places age in the central role and discusses not only how it is possible to support older employees, but also how to leverage their potential in the process of ICT adoption and use in a mandatory setting.","[Soja, Ewa] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Stat, Krakow, Poland; [Soja, Piotr] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Informat, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Soja, P (corresponding author), Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Informat, Krakow, Poland.",ewa.soja@uek.krakow.pl; eisoja@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Soja, Piotr/R-7293-2019","Soja, Piotr/0000-0002-7274-3327",,,,,95,12,14,5,51,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0398,1758-7409,,J ENTERP INF MANAG,J.

Simulations are conducted on the size of trade elasticities, the way the trade balance is modelled (macroeconomic closure), trade growth, and energy prices. Other topics scrutinized are the modelling of zeros, modelling of new technologies and new types of trade policies (trade in data and digitalization), phasing in of future trade policies, and migration and remittances. We conclude that there is relative consensus about the use of nested Armington preferences, whereas different scholars model the trade balance very differently. The discrepancy between baseline trade growth and historical trade growth is not considered in most models though highly relevant. Research efforts, both in terms of modelling and data collection, should be allocated to a better coverage of other items on the current account (capital income, remittances) and the inclusion of net foreign debt and asset positions, projecting trade growth based on historical patterns, and better tools to model the rapidly growing digital economy.","[Bekkers, Eddy; Teh, Robert] World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland; [Antimiani, Alessandro; Kutlina-Dimitrova, Zornitsa] European Commiss, Brussels, Belgium; [Carrico, Caitlyn] Wageningen Econ Res, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Flaig, Dorothee] Univ Hohenheim, Stuttgart, Germany; [Fontagne, Lionel; Foure, Jean] Ctr Etud Prospect & Informat Int, Paris, France; [Francois, Joseph] World Trade Inst, Bern, Switzerland; [Itakura, Ken] Nagoya City Univ, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan; [Powers, William; Tsigas, Marinos] US Int Trade Commiss, Washington, DC USA; [Saveyn, Bert] European Commiss, Seville, Spain; [van Tongeren, Frank] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France",World Trade Organization; Wageningen University & Research; University Hohenheim; Nagoya City University; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Bekkers, E (corresponding author), World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland.",eddy.bekkers@wto.org; alessandro.antimiani@ec.europa.eu; caitlyn.carrico@wur.nl; dorothee.flaig@uni-hohenheim.de; lionel.fontagne@cepii.fr; jean.foure@cepii.fr; joseph.francois@wti.org; itakura@econ.nagoya-cu.ac.jp; zornitsa.kutlina-dimitrova@ec.europa.eu; william.powers@ustic.gov; bert.saveyn@ec.europa.eu; robert.teh@bluewin.ch; frank.vantongeren@oecd.org; marinos.tsigas@ustic.gov,"Francois, Joseph/B-6108-2017","Francois, Joseph/0000-0002-4686-7780; Itakura, Ken/0000-0002-3642-6877; Teh, Robert/0000-0003-2506-6367",,,,,117,12,12,0,2,CENTER GLOBAL TRADE ANALYSIS,WEST LAFAYETTE,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, PURDUE UNIV, 403 W STATE ST, WEST LAFAYETTE, IN 47907-2056 USA",2377-2999,,,J GLOB ECON ANAL,J.

We argue that precarity should be put back to production, which has a twofold meaning: first, we emphasize that the labor process is of crucial importance for conceptualizing precarity, and precarity in the labor process is interrelated with precarity in the labor market and labor reproduction. Second, precarity should be understood through the relationships of production, particularly through capital-labor conflict. Using one case study on Didi Kuaiche drivers in the city of Nanjing, China, we examine the nature of precarity in the flexible labor of the digital economy and present a more nuanced micronarrative of precarious work in the ride-hailing service.

Therefore, even if one chose unreasonably to disregard the many innovations that the digital economy has brought about, its development seems quite inexorable, although it is true that this new stage in human progress raises some concerns. In particular, many worry about the millions of passive and powerless digital consumers who, facing a few huge and influential companies without any education or awareness, could succumb and find themselves poorer, victimized, and manipulated. The paper proposes to react to this state of affairs without further fueling the fear of the digital revolution and without the thought that regulation can be used only as a shield to protect fragile digital consumers. Rather, by taking inspiration from some regulatory actions undertaken by the European Union, the paper bears in mind that regulation can be used as a sword in the hands of consumers to finally assign them a lead role in digital markets. New rules to empower consumers and to make them take autonomous and independent decisions as to the management of their personal data as well as to the merits of digital firms can be envisaged. After all, one of the cultural roots of Western societies is that every individual should be enabled to be faber ipsius fortunae. (C) 2018 Giuseppe Colangelo and Mariateresa Maggiolino.

(2) What is the consumer's attitude toward privacy data? (3) How to price personal data to maximize the profit of the data platform? In this paper, we first propose a compensation mechanism based on the privacy attitude of the data provider. Second, we analyze consumer self-selection behavior and establish a non-linear model to represent consumers' willingness to pay (WTP). Finally, we establish a bi-level programming model and use genetic simulated annealing algorithm to solve the optimal pricing problem of personal data. The experimental results show that multi-level privacy division can meet the needs of consumers and maximize the profit of data platform.","[Yang, Jian] Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Chunxiao] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Natl Res Ctr Informat Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci & Technol, Res Inst Informat,Inst Internet Ind, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",University of Science & Technology Beijing; Tsinghua University,"Yang, J (corresponding author), Univ Sci & Technol Beijing, Sch Comp & Commun Engn, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",yjian180@gmail.com; xingcx@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Xing, Chunxiao/V-6953-2017","Xing, Chunxiao/0000-0001-9390-3097; Yang, Jian/0000-0002-3518-7851",National Nature Science Foundation of China [91646202]; National Key R&D Program of China [SQ2018YFB140235],National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key R&D Program of China,"This research was supported in part by National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 91646202), National Key R&D Program of China (SQ2018YFB140235).",,28,12,13,8,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2078-2489,,,INFORMATION,Information,APR,2019,10,4,,,,,,,123,10.3390/info10040123,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/info10040123,,,15,"Computer Science, Information Systems",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Computer Science,HX3ND,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000467297800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach Nationally representative survey data employed in this paper were collected in autumn 2017. The data collection utilized a multiphase sampling, and the interviews (n=1004) were carried out on telephone to minimize selection-bias and produce demographically balanced data. Findings Over two-thirds (71 percent) of Finns do not expect technological unemployment to constitute a permanent problem in the digital economy. Nevertheless, 74 percent assume that technological unemployment will increase at least temporarily. A considerable majority (85 percent) also believe that future jobs will be more precarious. Younger generations, despite their currently weak position in the labor market, are surprisingly more optimistic in their predictions. Analysis of preferred policy responses support this paper's main thesis that the Finnish view on the future of work is rather optimistic: education reforms and streamlining the current social security gather dedicated support, whereas more unconventional ideas such as basic income or work-sharing remain contested. Originality/value To predict possible barriers to labor mobility stemming from digital economy discourses and to anticipate possible political fluctuations, studies on the public view are needed. This research aims to provide a solid framework for further comparative explorations of the public view.","[Pulkka, Ville-Veikko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Pulkka, VV (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Social Res, Helsinki, Finland.",ville-veikko.pulkka@helsinki.fi,,"Pulkka, Ville-Veikko/0000-0002-5507-7107",,,,,36,12,13,0,16,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0144-333X,1758-6720,,INT J SOCIOL SOC POL,Int.

Digital entrepreneurs in East Asia can be thought of as a new class of 'creative workers' who aspire to the neoliberal ideals of the West that advocate free markets and individualism. While digital entrepreneurship offers low-cost opportunities, it also represents highly precarious careers. The transition to the digital economy also means the expansion of the informal economy, which has existed in both Taiwan and Thailand. The encouragement of start-up ecosystems by respective political and economic elites serves to sweet-talk the creative class into participating in precarious work, or it may be an open bid to gain market share by incorporating informal businesses. In response to the theme of the special issue, this article discusses two contrasting cases and considers the significance of digital entrepreneurship as informalisation of work.","[Leung, Wing-Fai] Kings Coll London, Culture Media & Creat Ind, London, England; [Cossu, Alberto] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England",University of London; King's College London; University of Leicester,"Leung, WF (corresponding author), Kings Coll London, Dept Culture Media & Creat Ind, London WC2R 2LS, England.",wing_fai.leung@kcl.ac.uk,"Leung, Wing-Fai/GLT-5729-2022; Cossu, Alberto/R-8724-2017","Cossu, Alberto/0000-0002-0766-7719; Leung, Wing-Fai/0000-0002-0352-6011",Taiwan Fellowship (2014),Taiwan Fellowship (2014),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Wing-Fai Leung acknowledges the support of Taiwan Fellowship (2014).",,37,12,13,2,58,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1367-8779,1460-356X,,INT J CULTURAL STUD,Int.

J,"Evans, GL",,,,"Evans, Graeme Lorenzo",,,Emergence of a digital cluster in east London: birth of a new hybrid firm,COMPETITIVENESS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Creative clusters; Digital Shoreditch; Tech city; Creative-digital hybrid firm,ECONOMIC-DEVELOPMENT; CULTURAL ECONOMY; INNOVATION,"Purpose This paper aims to investigate the composition and geography of an emerging creative digital cluster in London, in the context of cluster theory and emerging creative cluster concepts. This argues that this cluster cannot be divorced from the wider regional creative and digital economy and that its inter-dependence with a small number of content industries is critical to its formation. The significance of the creative digital firm blending design, communications and technological development is highlighted, as is its unique position in enabling such firms to flourish. Design/methodology/approach The research combines both quantitative with qualitative methods, based on cluster analysis of firm-level business data using GIS mapping software at a regional level; location quotient (LQ) analysis to reveal firm concentration at a local cluster level; an online questionnaire survey of firms within this cluster; participant observation of firm meet-ups over a three-year period; and face-to-face interviews with a sample of firms/owners. Findings The evidence generated from this research confirms the distinctive nature of this digital cluster and the benefits of co-location in an industrial district with proximities to a range of advanced producer services and cultural content provision. This has revealed an emerging techno-creative habitus (Scott 2010), which has been able to take advantage of market fluidity through a network of communities of interest firms, which have reshaped an existing global hub locally anchored by a highly porous locale. Originality/value The research is novel in combining spatial data analysis with qualitative research into firm behaviour and place-based factors that support the growth of this cluster. This has revealed new insights into the hybrid nature of tech firms that integrate content with both hardware and software applications and who innovate and grow through inter-personal cluster networks. This contributes to cluster theory and extends the range of proximities - social, institutional and cultural - that enhance the geographic advantages of clustering in this case.","[Evans, Graeme Lorenzo] Univ Arts London, Res, London, England",University of Arts London,"Evans, GL (corresponding author), Univ Arts London, Res, London, England.",g.l.evans@fashion.arts.ac.uk,,,,,,,48,12,12,12,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1059-5422,2051-3143,,COMPET REV,Compet.

It determines the main directions in the management of processes related to the accumulation and use of human capital as the production's main factor in the context of digitalization. Our goal was to develop a multi-factor model of human capital efficiency in the digital economy. We used the materials of the Boston Consulting Group, the World Development Bank, and data from The Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey - Higher School of Economics (RLMS-HSE) as the study's empirical base. As a research methodology, we chose a regression analysis based on the initial sample of data from RLMS 25, wave 2016, Data on IBM SPSS individuals. For the study of factors, we utilized the traditional J. Mincer equation, supplemented by quantitative and qualitative variables. We proved that expanding the range of parameters increases the coefficient of determination and the statistical significance of the parameters. On the basis of the empirical material, we confirmed a number of hypotheses on the determinants of the effective use of human capital in the digital economy. Particularly, the hypothesis about the impact of production experience on wages as an indicator of returns to human capital, previously put forward and supported by J. Mincer and his followers, is not confirmed for the digital economy. Digital technologies, replacing the old working methods, render the previous skills and organizational approaches irrelevant. Transformations caused by the environment's automation and digitalization change the working activities from clearly defined work responsibilities to design work. The development of skills in digital knowledge application is an essential factor for the effective use of human capital in the digital economy. These skills enable workers' adaptation to changing work processes and the employers' requirements. The study's results show that the correct interpretation of the determinants that affect the efficiency of the human capital use allow choosing the right targeting tools for managing human capital as a factor of economic growth.","[Kelchevskaya, N.

Several heuristics are used for attribution in practice; however, there is no formal justification for them and many of these fail even in simple canonical settings. The main contribution in this work is to develop an axiomatic framework for attribution in online advertising. In particular, we consider a Markovian model for the user journey through the conversion funnel, in which ad actions may have disparate impacts at different stages. We propose a novel attribution metric, that we refer to as counterfactual adjusted Shapley value, which inherits the desirable properties of the traditional Shapley value. Furthermore, we establish that this metric coincides with an adjusted unique-uniform attribution scheme. This scheme is efficiently computable and implementable and can be interpreted as a correction to the commonly used uniform attribution scheme.","[Singal, Raghav; Besbes, Omar; Goyal, Vineet; Iyengar, Garud] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Desir, Antoine] INSEAD, Fontainebleau, France",Columbia University; INSEAD Business School,"Singal, R (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",rs3566@columbia.edu; ob2105@gsb.columbia.edu; antoine.desir@insead.edu; vg2277@columbia.edu; garud@ieor.columbia.edu,,,"Adobe Digital Marketing Research Award; NSF [CMMI 1636046, CMMI 1351838]",Adobe Digital Marketing Research Award; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We acknowledge the support of Adobe Digital Marketing Research Award for this project.

An information-handling agenda is outlined for the development of a future Information Evaluation Methodology (IEM) which could facilitate the practice of the codification of high-value information in order to support through-life knowledge and information management (K&IM) practice.

Firstly, we enable provider agents to dynamically and autonomously advertise semantic descriptions of available services by proposing a new auction model based on Pay-Per-Click advertising auctions. We call it the Semantic Pay-Per-Click Agent (SPPCA) auction. Requester agents then use two-level filtration of the advertised services to efficiently discover eligible services. In the first level of filtration, a semantic-based mechanism for matchmaking between services requested by buyers and those advertised by sellers is applied. Services which pass the first level of filtration are then considered on the second level. Here information regarding the actual performance of service providers is considered in conjunction with the prices bid by service provider's agents in the SPPCA auction. A final set of advertised services is then chosen and proposed to the buyer agent as an answer to its request.","Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Telecommun, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia; Ericsson Nikola Tesla, R&D Ctr, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb; Ericsson,"Podobnik, V (corresponding author), Univ Zagreb, Fac Elect & Comp Engn, Dept Telecommun, Unska 3, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.",vedran.podobnik@fer.hr; krunoslav.trzec@ericsson.com; gordan.jezic@fer.hr,"Trzec, Krunoslav/JZU-0214-2024","Trzec, Krunoslav/0009-0001-5577-8261",,,,,20,12,12,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0302-9743,1611-3349,3-540-48269-5,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2006,4277,,,,,,97,106,,,,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Computer Science, Theory & Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science,BFN46,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000243319800032,View Full Record in Web of Science

While the unique characteristics of digital technologies and digital assets embody an expansive and promising global landscape for innovation, MNEs' success in pursuing such digital innovation will also be shaped by the nature and extent of localization forces prevalent in different foreign markets, an issue that has received limited attention in both digital innovation and international business literatures. In this short essay, I highlight this gap and call for the study of digital innovation in the international business context by bringing together ideas, theories and concepts from both areas. I draw on and combine two perspectives-one drawn from the innovation literature (digital innovation as recombinant innovation involving digital assets) and the other from the international business literature (the international business context as being defined by national policies and regulations, infrastructure and culture) and suggest several promising themes and questions for future research in this area, specifically relating to how globalization/localization forces facilitate/hinder MNEs' global digital innovation efforts. I hope the call made here will be answered by scholars from both fields and lead to insights that enrich both theory and practice related to MNE innovation in today's rapidly growing digital economy.","[Nambisan, Satish] Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Nambisan, S (corresponding author), Case Western Reserve Univ, Weatherhead Sch Management, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",spn24@case.edu,"N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023; Nambisan, Satish/AAE-3369-2020","Nambisan, Satish/0000-0001-9375-5223",,,,,50,11,11,35,242,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1447-9338,2204-0226,,INNOV-ORGAN MANAG,Innov.-Organ.

We use a data set of 4446 small- and medium-sized firms extracted from Funderbeam and logit regression models to test five hypotheses about internationalisation. Exploring a firm's digital presence indicates that the number of social media followers is a better indicator of internationalisation than website traffic, highlighting the importance of engagement signals in the digital space. Investment signals such as the time and size of funding are also positively related to internationalisation but surprisingly, not the number of investors, suggesting that more focused investment strategies work better in the international context. To complement our international network signalling approach, controlling for firm factors such as age and size and environmental factors such as competition and industry provides a more detailed analysis. Our contribution lies in extending signalling theory in the context of international networks using a novel and extensive data set.","[Kromidha, Endrit] Univ Birmingham, Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Robson, Paul J.

Such flows and situations should be simulated. This problem is solved based on flow-intensive management criteria using situational scenarios. The efficiency of flow management on busy highways requires the consideration of critical factors. In the present work, such a task is investigated using cell machines, which showed efficiency in streaming tasks of gas dynamics. A purpose of work and its result is a decline system's complexity and dimension by means of linearization and reduction of algorithmic complexity. The field of cells is considered. If there's an obstacle in the cell then the direction by which the obstacle affects minimally is selected (Stochastic assessment has been used).

By reconstructing the ecological approach to systemic risk, this paper argues that there are two key factors that enable this oversized risk. The first is the level of risk across the system, which is shown to be intensified in systems that exhibit interconnectedness, complexity, mismatches between knowledge and activity, and low redundancy. The second is the extent to which the system serves as a widespread necessary condition, that is a universal intermediary, for other social practices. This paper shows how these factors apply to pre-crisis finance and, how they apply to the contemporary networked digital economy, with potentially devastating economic and social consequences.","[Curran, Dean] Univ Calgary, Dept Sociol, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Curran, D (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Dept Sociol, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",dcurran@ucalgary.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [403-2018-0263],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work has been supported by Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 403-2018-0263] for funding part of this research.,,84,11,11,3,80,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

At the same time, increasing penetration of distributed generation and constant power loads complicate the job for the electric utilities to deliver high-quality electrical power. Traditionally, voltage source converters provide PQ compensation; the backbone of these converters, however, are large electrolytic capacitors (e-caps), which have well-known failure rates. A D-STATCOM that does not use e-caps was shown to increase the converter service life and increase the reliability of the power system; finite control set model predictive control (MPC) was shown to achieve high fidelity tracking for multi-objective cost functions. However, high fidelity (to achieve low total harmonic distortion) results in high switching frequency, which increases losses and device stresses, and reduces the overall converter reliability. This paper improves the capacitorless D-STATCOM by investigating an adaptive MPC that trades-off high-fidelity performance and switching frequency, subject to IEEE 519 TM standards, to achieve good-enough performance. The method is verified experimentally in a 7.5 kVA D-STATCOM hardware prototype. The results show a reduction in switching frequency by over 30% compared with the MPC methods that prioritize high-fidelity alone.","[Rohouma, Wesam; Metry, Morcos; Balog, Robert S.] Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Renewable Energy & Adv Power Elect Res Lab, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Doha, Qatar; [Peerzada, Aaqib Ahmad; Begovic, Miroslav M.] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Qatar Foundation (QF); Texas A&M University Qatar; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Rohouma, W (corresponding author), Texas A&M Univ Qatar, Renewable Energy & Adv Power Elect Res Lab, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Doha, Qatar.",wesam.rohouma@ieee.org,"Rohouma, Wesam/ABB-8836-2020","Rohouma, Wesam/0000-0003-1320-8823; Balog, Robert/0000-0002-0090-4259; Peerzada, Aaqib/0000-0003-1082-636X",NPRP from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation) [9-204-2-103],NPRP from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation),This work was supported by NPRP under Grant #9-204-2-103 from the Qatar National Research Fund (a member of Qatar Foundation).

We then provide concrete examples of how these government data are used to make business decisions focusing on three sectors: automotive, energy, and financial services. Examples of new initiatives by the federal government to open access to more data, exploiting technology advances associated with the internet, cloud storage, and software applications, are discussed. With the significant growth in the digital economy, we also include discussion and insights around how digital platform companies utilize government data in conjunction with their privately generated data (or big data) to foster more informed business decisions.","[Hughes-Cromwick, Ellen] Univ Michigan, Energy Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Hughes-Cromwick, Ellen; Coronado, Julia] MacroPolicy Perspect LLC, New York, NY USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Hughes-Cromwick, E (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Energy Inst, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Hughes-Cromwick, E (corresponding author), MacroPolicy Perspect LLC, New York, NY USA.",ehughesc@umich.edu,,,,,,,21,11,19,26,211,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Design/methodology/approach The research is performed by the example of modern Russia with application of the methods of trend analysis and regression analysis in two consecutive stages. The authors determine regression dependence of the efficiency of digital modernization of universities (on the basis of the indicator of fixed assets implementation) on the volume of investments into fixed assets. Dependence of the indicator of digital competitiveness of education (training and education), calculated within the part knowledge of the IMD rating world digital competitiveness ranking, on commissioning of fixed assets by universities is determined. For the purpose of representativeness of the selection of statistical data, which initial period is 2012, not only factual data for 2012-2018 are used but also forecast data for 2019-2024 (as the national program digital economy of the Russian Federation is due until 2024). Findings Low effectiveness of usage of venture investments in digital education in Russia is substantiated. As investments are provided in the form of target state financing, universities cannot independently determine the directions of their usage and have to use them for purchasing digital equipment and technologies. Other necessary measures for digital modernization of education, namely, training of digital personnel for university, access to digital infrastructure, development of new educational programs, conduct of research and development and marketing, are not implemented. Originality/value It is determined that attraction of private venture investments faces the problem of their large volume and high risk. Both problems could be solved by the developed mechanism of investment and innovative activities of a university in the conditions of industry 4.0. It shifts the initiative from university to digital business, which independently initiates the process of venture investing.","[Dobrosotskiy, Viktor I.] Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Minist Foreign Affairs Russia, Moscow, Russia; [Semenova, Galina N.; Kazarinova, Elena B.] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Falina, Natalya V.] Kuban State Agr Univ, Krasnodar, Russia",MGIMO University; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Kuban State Agrarian University,"Dobrosotskiy, VI (corresponding author), Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Minist Foreign Affairs Russia, Moscow, Russia.",dobrosotskiy@mgimo.ru,,,,,,,13,11,11,1,21,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1074-8121,2054-1708,,HORIZON,Horizon,OCT 11,2019,27,3-4,,,SI,,213,218,,10.1108/OTH-07-2019-0035,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/OTH-07-2019-0035,,,6,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Education & Educational Research,JF2DQ,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000491196500013,View Full Record in Web of Science

In parallel with technology advancements, it is important to consider the digital chain of information. Although a plethora of AM formats exist, only some are commonly used for data transfer. None of these AM data transfer standards specifically addresses the needs of the re-distributed manufacturing (RDM) landscape. The purpose of this study is to identify the required features for AM data transfer standards to support a RDM landscape. The study examined the data flow from CAD to AM and reviewed established shortcomings of existing data exchange standards such as STL. After identifying the data exchange standards for AMF, 3MF, STEP and STEP-NC as promising replacements for STL, their premises, objectives, contributions and advantages were reviewed. The role of AM to support RDM by overcoming tooling costs and the associated need for economies of scale was also reviewed. Focus group interviews and surveys were conducted with AM and RDM experts from industry and academia and the participants' accounts were analysed for common themes and narratives. Finally, the suitability of existing data transfer formats was examined by compiling existing and expected standard features and having them rated by AM experts. The study showed that STEP-NC and AMF standards are ahead in implementing the most highly valued data transfer features. Open standards are also expected to further facilitate innovation in AM. The survey also identified that the top five features deemed most important by the participants for data exchange formats for RDM were regular internal structures/lattices, manufacturing tolerances, geometric representation, curvature representation, and surface structures. This study has contributed towards evaluating existing standards and their future development and adoption. It is hoped that the results will benefit policy makers and industry leaders to be aware of the importance of data exchange standards for AM so as to pave a clear roadmap for the Digital Economy in a RDM landscape.","[Pei, Eujin] Brunel Univ London, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, England; [Ressin, Malte] Univ West London, London W5, England; [Campbell, R.

This article examines the impact of Aid for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) (a component of AfT) on the global digital divide of recipient countries, measured by the Internet penetration rate (i.e., the proportion of individuals using the Internet in a given country) and the Internet penetration distance (i.e., the difference between a country's Internet penetration rate and the world average). The analysis was conducted on a sample of 119 countries, spanning the period 2004-2015. We find empirical evidence that higher AfT inflows for ICT are conducive to both higher Internet penetration rate and higher Internet penetration distance for recipient countries. However, more advanced AfT recipient-countries experience a higher positive effect of AfT for ICT than do relatively less advanced countries. These findings suggest that scaling up of AfT for ICT for developing countries (but particularly the poorest countries) is necessary to help them build the Internet-related infrastructure necessary to benefit from the growing digital economy.","[Gnangnon, Sena Kimm] Org Mondiale Commerce Dev, Rue Lausanne 154, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland",,"Gnangnon, SK (corresponding author), Org Mondiale Commerce Dev, Rue Lausanne 154, CH-1202 Geneva, Switzerland.",kignangnon@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,11,11,8,48,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1944-2866,,,POLICY INTERNET,Policy Internet,SEP,2019,11,3,,,,,344,369,,10.1002/poi3.220,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/poi3.220,,AUG 2019,26,Communication; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Communication; Government & Law,IU6UA,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000482814100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Advanced economies have been confronting a dilemma between input increases and output decreases. Contrary to traditional expectations, excessive increase in input has resulted in a productivity decline in output. A solution to this dilemma can only be expected by harnessing the vigor of soft innovation resources that lead to neo open innovation in the digital economy. This paper attempts to demonstrate this hypothetical view. Based on an empirical analysis of the development trajectories of 140 countries and 500 global ICT firms, dynamism, resulting in bipolarization between a virtuous cycle and a vicious cycle between input increases and productivity enhancement, was discovered. Furthermore, an empirical analysis focusing on the development trajectories of two world ICT leaders, Finland and Singapore, identified a mechanism of neo open innovation that assimilates soft innovation resources into a national production system. This mechanism can substitute for research and development (R&D) and removes structural impediments to growth while providing relief from the increasing burden of R&D investment. The above findings provide insightful suggestions for drafting a roadmap towards neo open innovation in the digital economy.","[Tou, Yuji] Tokyo Inst Technol, Tokyo, Japan; [Watanabe, Chihiro; Moriya, Kuniko; Neittaanmaki, Pekka] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Watanabe, Chihiro] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria; [Moriya, Kuniko] Bank Japan, Res & Stat Dept, Tokyo, Japan",Tokyo Institute of Technology; University of Jyvaskyla; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); Bank of Japan,"Watanabe, C (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",tou.yuji@gmail.com; watanabe.c.pqr@gmail.com; kuniko.moriya@boj.or.jp; pekka.neittaanmaki@jyu.fi,,,Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [293446],Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland,"The research leading to these results is the part of a project: Platform Value Now: Value capturing in the fast emerging platform ecosystems, supported by the Strategic Research Council at the Academy of Finland [grant number 293446].",,59,11,11,5,50,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

A growing body of literature has dedicated to the patterns, causes, and consequences of individuals' privacy concerns, skills, and practices. Advancing a producer's perspective, this research draws on in-depth interviews with 45 tech entrepreneurs to examine privacy practices of mobile start-ups in the United States. Results reveal (a) factors that contribute to the problematic status of privacy issues and (b) whether and how entrepreneurs leverage privacy management as a competitive advantage. Results show that data are widely seen by entrepreneurs as a potentially profitable asset. Privacy practices are networked and thus pose challenges for privacy management as different parties may have different privacy practices. Fast-moving technologies often leave government regulations behind, making them look outdated or irrelevant to many entrepreneurs. For most start-ups not specialized in identity, privacy, or anonymity service, privacy is neither a core business strategy nor a top concern. Only a few mobile ventures have leveraged privacy management as a competitive advantage and designed their products from the ground up concerned about privacy. Most entrepreneurs adopt a building-the-plane-while-flying-it approach: as business grows, privacy policies and practices would evolve. Many entrepreneurs fail to recognize the significance of privacy policies and practices as they lack the awareness, bandwidth, and capacity. Growth and monetization pressures from investors are perceived as more urgent and important than privacy and security issues. Offering a richer account of the power structure that shapes mobile entrepreneurs' privacy practices and their challenges of managing privacy in a data-driven digital economy, our work advances the existing literature dominated by stories of the individual consumers.","[Chen, Wenhong] Univ Texas Austin, Media Studies & Sociol, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Huang, Gejun; Mauro, Daniel] Univ Texas Austin, Radiotelevis Film Dept, 2504 Whitis Ave,Stop A0800, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Lee, Kye-Hyoung] Univ Texas Austin, Off Enrollment Analyt, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Stephens, Bryan] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Sociol, 2504 Whitis Ave,Stop A0800, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Li, Xiaoqian] Univ Texas Austin, Moody Coll Commun, Dept Radiotelevis Film, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Miller, Joshua] Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Apple Inc,"Chen, WH (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Radiotelevis Film Dept, 2504 Whitis Ave,Stop A0800, Austin, TX 78712 USA.;Chen, WH (corresponding author), Univ Texas Austin, Dept Sociol, 2504 Whitis Ave,Stop A0800, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",wenchen2006@gmail.com,"Jia, Chuanchang/AAA-5513-2020; Stephens, Bryan/GXH-4076-2022; Stephens, Bryan/AAN-8596-2021","Stephens, Bryan/0000-0002-0966-7296","Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal; IC2 Institute; Office of the Vice President for Research at The University of Texas Austin; Center for Identity; Center for East Asian Studies","Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); IC2 Institute; Office of the Vice President for Research at The University of Texas Austin; Center for Identity; Center for East Asian Studies","The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research project has been financially supported by the Foundation for Science and Technology, Portugal, as well as the IC2 Institute, Center for Identity, Center for East Asian Studies, and the Office of the Vice President for Research at The University of Texas Austin.",,42,11,13,0,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0002-7642,1552-3381,,AM BEHAV SCI,Am.

The last few years have witnessed both a proliferation of business models underlying these hubs and the failure of many of these hubs. This study identifies key structural dimensions of vertical hubs and develops a conceptual framework to characterize vertical hubs. We draw from the industrial organization theory and the marketing literature to examine the relationship between the characteristics of the vertical hubs, those of the industries they serve, and the products transacted through the hubs. Based on data collected from 63 B2B vertical hubs, we test our hypotheses relating industry and product characteristics to the structure of vertical hubs. The results provide modest support to our theoretical proposition that the characteristics of vertical hubs are likely to be shaped by the industry and product characteristics.

In addressing this issue, we explore a number of common themes emphasized by the different contributions: the future of the North-South divide, the role of the state in promoting digital development, the transferability and adaptability of specific information and communication technologies, the challenges and potential benefits of controlling digital information, and the developmental effects of digitally enabled communities. We argue that the Digital Revolution's ultimate impact on development will depend on several key variables, including the extent to which these technologies foster within-country linkages among different sectors and socioeconomic classes; the degree to which new technological applications may be customized or transformed to advance local development; and the outcome of political contests between organized interests that are promoting different ways of organizing and governing the global digital economy.

It addresses the transport and trade implications of the shift from an economy dominated by physical movements to one where electronic communications aid and, indeed, under certain circumstances, eliminate or reduce physical flows. In particular, it points out that the revolution taking place is mainly due to deep changes in distribution processes caused by the spread of e-commerce and by a production system based on networks of different types ( production, financial, information, etc.). Major topics for exploration are the specific roles of networks, new interpretations of access and distance in virtual and physical spaces, the adoption, spread and impact of e-commerce, the multifaceted process of integration and Internetworking, territorial competitiveness in the digital economy, intermodality, and the growth of logistical systems and their impact upon supply chains. Factors surrounding the shippers' choice of freight transport services, communications and transport patterns between consumers and businesses, and general sustainability in these increasingly complex systems are also important. All these topics are ripe for research from both theoretical and methodological perspectives.","Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, Lexington, KY 40506 USA; Univ Siena, Fac Sci Polit, Di Gips, I-53100 Siena, Italy",University of Kentucky; University of Siena,"Univ Kentucky, Dept Geog, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",leinbach@uky.edu,,,,,,,43,11,14,2,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0144-1647,1464-5327,,TRANSPORT REV,Transp.

Thus, this study aims at filling this research gap by measuring digitisation in two perspectives; internet penetration rate and mobile telephone subscription. The Im-Pesaran-Shin (IPS) unit-root test affirms that the data are suitable for panel ARDL estimation technique. The estimation establishes that youth unemployment, digitisation and the control variables are cointegrated. This study also reveals that digitisation could reduce youth unemployment in West Africa, both at the short-and long-run but not convincing due to low appreciation of digital technologies. In the short-run, the result is consistent in some countries but not same and robust in some others. Thus, the paper concludes that increasing digitisation would enhance employment opportunities for the youths in the West African region.","[Azu, Nnanna P.; Jelilov, Gylych; Aras, Osman Nuri; Isik, Abdurrahman] Nile Univ Nigeria, Dept Econ, Abuja, Nigeria",,"Azu, NP (corresponding author), Nile Univ Nigeria, Dept Econ, Abuja, Nigeria.",nnanna.azu@nileuniversity.edu.ng,"Aras, Osman Nuri/AAC-3361-2019; ISIK, ABDURRAHMAN/ABI-1249-2020; Aras, Osman Nuri/GYQ-9716-2022; Aras, Osman Nuri/AAC-2386-2019; JELILOV, Gylych/C-1397-2016","ISIK, ABDURRAHMAN/0000-0001-9188-9404; Aras, Osman Nuri/0000-0001-9757-4008; JELILOV, Gylych/0000-0002-7428-7361; AZU, NNANNA PHILEMON/0000-0002-4448-1278",,,,,26,10,11,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1918-6444,1925-2099,,TRANSNATL CORP REV,Transnatl.

Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 18 frameworks and indices of consumers' digital capabilities were compared based on their purposes, stakeholders, scope and application areas. Findings - The study concludes with propositions that generalise current views on conceptualisation, measurement and management of consumers' digital capabilities. Each proposition is further investigated in terms of possible implications for research and practice. Practical implications - The study indicates opportunities for businesses not only to consider consumers as recipients and adopters of digital technologies but also to aim to understand how to proactively involve consumers in value co-creation, help them be better educated and have a comprehensive understanding of potential outcomes of their participation in the digital economy. Social implications - Highlighting individual consumer perspective in existing indices and frameworks will help consider the interests of society and provide win-win opportunities for everyone involved in the digital marketplace through bottom-up engagement in addition to top-down regulation and monitoring. Originality/value - This study contributes to the extant literature threefold: firstly, existing digital capability frameworks and indices are systematized and critically investigated using criteria of stakeholders, purpose and aims; secondly, consumers are identified as principal stakeholder group whose interests are insufficiently presented in existing indices; thirdly, an integrative approach is suggested for a crucial comparison of existing indices, frameworks and their methodology with the focus on consumers' interests.","[Malchenko, Yulia; Gogua, Megi; Golovacheva, Ksenia; Smirnova, Maria; Alkanova, Olga] St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, Dept Mkt, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Gogua, M (corresponding author), St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, Dept Mkt, St Petersburg, Russia.",m.gogua@spbu.ru,"Golovacheva, Kseniia/O-9681-2016; Smirnova, Maria/AAH-6982-2021; Gogua, Megi/AAV-9176-2021; Malchenko, Yulia/AAH-7543-2021; Alkanova, Olga/HTM-5814-2023; Alkanova, Olga/J-8267-2013","Smirnova, Maria/0000-0003-2799-9136; Gogua, Megi/0000-0002-2016-1755; Alkanova, Olga/0000-0002-2530-6765; Malchenko, Yulia/0000-0002-2183-3189",Saint Petersburg State University [41108405],Saint Petersburg State University,"This research has been conducted with financial support from Saint Petersburg State University, grant ID 41108405.",,56,10,10,7,44,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2398-5038,2398-5046,,DIGIT POLICY REGUL G,Digit.

However, international tax law has seemingly failed to keep pace with rapid technological developments, which has likely led to inequalities between the tax burden of traditional and digital business models. Thus far, there has been no consensus regarding the issue of fair taxation of the digital economy at the international and EU level. As European policymakers have begun to experience noticeable amounts of pressure to act, several EU countries have pushed forward and introduced unilateral measures to ensure they receive a fair share of the tax revenues pie. However, it is unclear whether national digital taxes can overcome the tax challenges stemming from the increasing digitalisation of the economy. Thus, newly proposed and implemented national digital taxes in Europe are thoroughly elaborated in the context of their relationship with double tax treaty law, the perils of double/multiple taxation, their coherence with European law, their global and regional impact on competition and competitiveness, their contribution to tax revenues and the establishment of fair taxation conditions. The analysis concludes with a presentation of pertinent suggestions regarding national and supranational tax policy.","[Geringer, Stefanie] Univ Vienna, Dept Tax Law, Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Geringer, S (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Dept Tax Law, Vienna, Austria.",stefanie.geringer@univie.ac.at,,,,,,,61,10,15,7,61,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1029-1954,2376-3981,,S AFR J ACCOUNT RES,S.

Consumers are increasingly demanding efficient access to health care information and services irrespective of time and distance, which is further driving the digitization of health care. This digital economy has created new opportunities for innovative new business models to meet the needs of these new markets. This study explores several in-use business models of virtual health care service platforms that incorporate mobile teledermoscopy (MTD) technologies. By comparing the different building blocks of these commercial ventures, we provide insights on business model choices and discuss the elements that contribute to economically sustainable and viable service offerings incorporating MTD applications. Materials and Methods: We searched the literature on teledermatology, complemented by searches using Google and other mobile app store platforms, and identified seven commercial ventures using teledermoscopy. We analyzed the building blocks of each business model by using an adapted version of Ash Maurya's Lean Canvas and Alexander Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas. Results: We identified three business elements that support the viability, sustainability, and growth of online dermatology services: developing key partnerships, clinician involvement in the design and implementation process, and managing the medico-legal risks and liabilities that are relevant for each country. Conclusions: Leveraging mobile technologies to deliver virtual health care present new business opportunities for health care providers. A better understanding of the business features associated with existing commercial ventures may increase uptake and improve financial viability of MTD applications as a complementary tool to traditional patient care models.","[Kho, Joanna; Gillespie, Nicole] Univ Queensland, UQ Business Sch, Colin Clark Bldg,39 Blair Dr, St Lucia, Qld 4067, Australia; [Horsham, Caitlin; Snoswell, Centaine; Janda, Monika] Univ Queensland, Fac Med, Ctr Hlth Serv Res, Woolloongabba, Qld, Australia; [Vagenas, Dimitrios] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, Sch Publ Hlth & Social Work, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Soyer, H.

This rapid increase continued in 2018, and Amazon accomplished a skyrocketing increase in its market capitalization, closing to being the world's biggest company. Such a rapid increase in R&D and subsequent market value has raised questions about how to conduct R&D and secure a large amount of funds needed for high-risk investments. Amazon has provided hypothetical answers to both of these questions. Amazon has been conducting innovative R&D to transform routine or periodic alterations into significant improvements during the R&D process and claiming huge expenses for such transformation activities as expenses for R&D. The company's ample free cash flow generated by sophisticated cash conversion cycle (CCC) management endorsed a large amount of investment for such a high-risk strategy. Increased R&D induced business advancement and lean cost structure construction leading to a further increase in cash flow has stimulated interactions between vendors, customers, and Amazon via the Amazon marketplace. Activated interaction-accelerated CCC advancement, a subsequent free cash flow increase, and user-driven innovation have thus simultaneously accelerated R&D transformation. All of these components - R&D transformation and technopreneurial strategy consisting of technology management, as well as marketplace development and CCC-driven cash flow generation consisting of financing management - function together as a consolidated sophisticated machine. Thus, Amazon has succeeded in fusing technology management and financing management by orchestrating all techno-financing systems. In light of increasing concerns regarding R&D expansion without the dilemma of a productivity decline that most digital economies are now confronting, this paper demonstrates the above hypothetical answers. Following the authors' preceding analysis of Amazon's unique technology management toward a new concept of R&D in the digital economy, an intensive empirical analysis focusing on the development trajectory of Amazon's techno-financing system over the last two decades was conducted. An insightful suggestion as to neo-open innovation that fuses technology management and financing management is thus provided.","[Tou, Yuji] Tokyo Inst Technol, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Tokyo, Japan; [Watanabe, Chihiro; Neittaanmaki, Pekka] Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland; [Watanabe, Chihiro] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Laxenburg, Austria",Tokyo Institute of Technology; University of Jyvaskyla; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Watanabe, C (corresponding author), Univ Jyvaskyla, Fac Informat Technol, Jyvaskyla, Finland.",tou.yuji@gmail.com; watanabe.c.pqr@gmail.com; pekka.neittaanmaki@jyu.fi,,,,,,,44,10,11,3,30,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-791X,1879-3274,,TECHNOL SOC,Technol.

To judge the long-term prospects of particular projects and this new technology in general, it is important to understand how smart contracts are used. While public announcements, by their nature, make promises of what smart contracts might achieve, openly available data of blockchains provides a more balanced view on what is actually going on. We focus on Ethereum as the major platform for smart contracts and aim at a comprehensive picture of the smart contract landscape regarding common or heavily used types of contracts. To this end, we unravel the publicly available data of the main chain up to block 9 000 000, in order to obtain an understanding of almost 20 million deployed smart contracts and 1.5 billion interactions. As smart contracts act behind the scenes, their activities are only fully accessible by also considering the execution traces triggered by transactions. They serve as the basis for this analysis, in which we group contracts according to common characteristics, observe temporal aspects and characterize them quantitatively and qualitatively. We use static methods by analyzing the bytecode of contracts as well as dynamic methods by aggregating and classifying the communication between contracts.","[di Angelo, Monika; Salzer, Gernot] TU Wien, Vienna, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien,"di Angelo, M (corresponding author), TU Wien, Vienna, Austria.",monika.di.angelo@tuwien.ac.at; gernot.salzer@tuwein.ac.at,,"di Angelo, Monika/0000-0002-4217-4530; Salzer, Gernot/0000-0002-8950-1551",,,,,14,10,11,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-030-54455-3; 978-3-030-54454-6,LECT NOTES COMPUT SC,,,2020,12063,,,,,,389,404,,10.1007/978-3-030-54455-3_28,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-54455-3_28,,,16,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Information Systems; Communication; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Political Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Computer Science; Communication; Government & Law,BS3NG,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000713505900028,View Full Record in Web of Science

This is part of the broader question of when and why these forms of organization are more efficient relative to alternatives, given that some firms simultaneously utilize crowdsourcing, marketplaces, and traditional forms of organization. We observe that an important cluster of these new organizational forms are able to circumvent knowledge constraints, because they combine elements of market and hierarchical organization in firm-designed hybrid arrangements. We further categorize these firm-designed markets into one-sided market arrangements (crowds) and two-sided market arrangements (marketplaces). To explain their efficiency relative to hierarchies and relative to each other, we take a knowledge-based perspective and review ways in which firm-designed markets reduce or remove both first-order (known unknown) and second-order (unknown unknown) knowledge constraints compared with hierarchies. Our argument hinges on the notion that firm-designed markets provide semidirected and undirected search and generativity mechanisms that allow firms to go beyond what is possible with centrally directed search.","[Tajedin, Hamed] SANA Technol, Tehran, Iran; [Tajedin, Hamed] Sharif Univ Technol, Grad Sch Management & Econ, Tehran 11365, Iran; [Madhok, Anoop] York Univ, Schulich Sch Business, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Madhok, Anoop] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Madrid 28933, Spain; [Keyhani, Mohammad] Univ Calgary, Haskayne Sch Business, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",Sharif University of Technology; York University - Canada; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; University of Calgary,"Tajedin, H (corresponding author), SANA Technol, Tehran, Iran.;Tajedin, H (corresponding author), Sharif Univ Technol, Grad Sch Management & Econ, Tehran 11365, Iran.",tajedin@sanags.ir; amadhok@schulich.yorku.ca; mohammad.keyhani@haskayne.ucalgary.ca,"Madhok, Anoop/KHV-4276-2024; Keyhani, Mohammad/U-8218-2018","Madhok, Anoop/0000-0001-5831-692X; Keyhani, Mohammad/0000-0001-9110-6959",,,,,105,10,10,4,24,INFORMS,CATONSVILLE,"5521 RESEARCH PARK DR, SUITE 200, CATONSVILLE, MD 21228 USA",2333-2050,2333-2077,,STRATEG SCI,Strateg.

Through the development towards a digital economy, they have gained further relevance, which caused the VC industry to diversify in terms of business models. This article offers a new heuristic to study the VC industry by developing a classification of VC firms. By drawing on a framework of different dimensions of relational distance in investment relations, different types of relational coordination are identified by comparing VC firms in Germany. The types of VC business models are found to produce relational geographies of investing as they relate with their portfolio startups in different ways. A relational perspective on VC thus provides the opportunity to step beyond pure territorial approaches on VC.","[Kuebart, Andreas] Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space, Res Dept Dynam Econ Spaces, Erkner, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Raumbezogene Sozialforschung (IRS),"Kuebart, A (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Res Soc & Space, Flakenstr 29-31, D-15537 Erkner, Germany.",andreas.kuebart@leibniz-irs.de,"Kuebart, Andreas/AAT-8645-2020","Kuebart, Andreas/0000-0003-1972-5776",,,,,71,10,10,4,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0965-4313,1469-5944,,EUR PLAN STUD,Eur.

The ethos of the tech industry transmogrified in recent years, shifting from the market-besotted optimism championed by Bill Gates to the digital feudalism represented by Bay Area neoreactionaries and cybermonarchists. The article argues that this points to a new configuration of fascist ideology taking shape under the aegis of, and working in tandem with, neoliberal governance. If every rise of fascism bears witness to a failed revolution (a thought attributed to Walter Benjamin but as an elision of his arguments), the rise of cryptofascist tendencies within the tech industry bears witness to the failures of the ?digital revolution? whose promises of a post-scarcity economy and socialised capital never came to pass. From this perspective, it is proposed, the online cultural wars are a proxy for a greater battle around de-Westernisation, imperialism and white hegemony.","[Pinto, Ana Teixeira] DAI, Arnhem, Netherlands; [Pinto, Ana Teixeira] Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Pinto, AT (corresponding author), DAI, Arnhem, Netherlands.;Pinto, AT (corresponding author), Leuphana Univ, Luneburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,41,10,11,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0952-8822,1475-5297,,THIRD TEXT,Third Text,MAY 4,2019,33,3,,,SI,,315,336,,10.1080/09528822.2019.1625638,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2019.1625638,,,22,Art,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Art,JI9EH,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000493764600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is based on multidisciplinarity and adaptivity of educational technologies, starting with the basic level of education - bachelor's degree, and ending with gaining competences in the field of engineering and economics throughout the whole professional life of a student. The purpose of this paper is to perform a detailed analysis of development of permanent education in Russian universities, focusing on statistical data on popularity of jobs as to professional groups among employers and determining peculiarities of permanent education, based on the distinguished peculiarities of permanent education and requirements of business to develop a model of engineering and managerial education that would integrate two blocks of the educational process - engineering and economic, as well as include modern technologies of teaching. Design/methodology/approach The authors propose the modern model of engineering management education that is implemented in the Russian technical universities. Its distinctive feature as compared to the conventional educational technologies is gaining competences in the field of economics and management at the same time with engineering education at the second stage of education - the master's program. The proposed model of engineering and management education results in obtainment of two diplomas by the student who is awarded with a master's degree in engineering and a master's degree in economics. A difference of the offered model from the traditional educational technologies is obtaining competences in the sphere of economics and management together with engineering education at the master's program. The result of the offered model of engineering and managerial education is graduate's receiving two diplomas with master's degree of engineer and master of economics. The paper shows the existing mechanism of implementing the model of engineering and economic education in a technical university by the example of the master's program in Economics Evaluation of economic risks during technological decisions (in oil processing and oil chemistry). Findings The offered model of engineering and managerial education will allow training the engineers of a new type, who will be able to adapt to new tendencies and initiate the changes that are necessary for effective functioning of business in the conditions of digital economy. Originality/value The offered model of engineering and managerial education should be acknowledged as an innovational educational project that raises demand for graduates through their adaptability to employer's needs and their usage of new tools of management that are based on exchange of information data and that form managerial task for information provision of the process of decision making and their further execution.","[Vanchukhina, Lyubov; Leybert, Tatyana; Rogacheva, Anastasia; Rudneva, Yulia; Khalikova, Elvira] Ufa State Oil Tech Univ, Ufa, Russia",Ufa State Petroleum Technological University,"Vanchukhina, L (corresponding author), Ufa State Oil Tech Univ, Ufa, Russia.",BUA1996@yandex.ru,"Rudneva, Yulia/AAU-6236-2020; Khalikova, Elvira/AAU-6185-2020; Rogacheva, Anastasiya/ABD-7202-2020; Vanchukhina, Lubov/AAU-7880-2020",,,,,,22,10,10,1,25,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0951-354X,1758-6518,,INT J EDUC MANAG,Int.

The results obtained make it possible to take administrative decisions in an optimal way, which reduces the negative effects of externalities and results in the most efficient use of energy resources.","[Krasnov, Sergey; Sergeev, Sergey; Zotova, Elizaveta; Grashchenko, Nadezhda] Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Polytech Skaya 29, St Petersburg 195251, Russia",Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University,"Zotova, E (corresponding author), Peter Great St Petersburg Polytech Univ, Polytech Skaya 29, St Petersburg 195251, Russia.",zotova@kafedrapik.ru,"Краснов, Сергей/AAM-5684-2021; Krasnov, Sergey/T-2859-2017; Sergeev, Sergey/B-4855-2016","Краснов, Сергей/0000-0003-1983-6804; Krasnov, Sergey/0000-0003-1983-6804;",,,,,11,10,10,0,3,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2267-1242,,,E3S WEB CONF,,,2019,110,,,,,,,,2052,10.1051/e3sconf/201911002052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/201911002052,,,9,Construction & Building Technology; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Construction & Building Technology; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BP9ED,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000569050000141,View Full Record in Web of Science

Russia, among many other countries, is currently developing a digital economy strategy aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth and increasing productivity. This paper aims to add to the current debate on the priorities of digital economy in Russia by benchmarking Russian ICT development with that in the EU countries and identifying some important preconditions for the digital transformation. The analysis demonstrates that while the use for Internet and demand for web-based content in Russia is high even by European standards, in Russia, digital technologies in Russia are still seen more as a means of communication rather than a channel for transactions and a source for enhancing business productivity. The lag in terms of connectivity, digital skills, and business adoption of digital technology is significant and is likely to further increase. The economic incentives driving digital economy in the EU countries (such as high labor costs and competition) are insufficient in the Russian context. Based on the analysis, the new digital economy strategy should be oriented at supporting three main priorities: reducing administrative barriers and creating economic incentives for business digitalization; developing ICT infrastructure with special attention to speed and quality of connection services; and investing in digital skills. These efforts should be complemented by a monitoring and evaluation framework including both core dimensions measured in the EU and sector-specific metrics of digital transformation.","[Dobrolyubova, Elena; Yefremov, Alexey] Russian Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Moscow, Russia; [Alexandrov, Oleg] CEFC Grp, Moscow, Russia",Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration,"Dobrolyubova, E (corresponding author), Russian Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Moscow, Russia.",dobrolyubova@inbox.ru; aleksandrov@cefc.ru; efremov-a@ranepa.ru,"Dobrolyubova, Elena/F-8696-2014; Dobrolyubova, Elena/AFL-6214-2022; Dobrolyubova, Elena/AAG-6219-2022; Aleksandrov, Oleg V/H-6480-2014; Ефремов, Алексей A/W-3226-2017","Dobrolyubova, Elena/0000-0002-9405-4936; Aleksandrov, Oleg V/0000-0002-5637-316X; Ефремов, Алексей A/0000-0001-9454-4305",,,,,30,10,10,9,36,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1865-0929,1865-0937,978-3-319-69784-0; 978-3-319-69783-3,COMM COM INF SC,,,2017,745,,,,,,431,444,,10.1007/978-3-319-69784-0_36,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-69784-0_36,,,14,"Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Computer Science; Telecommunications,BO4XN,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000515664100036,View Full Record in Web of Science

The great impact that IoT will bring to service offerings and its spatial consequence is disproportionate to how much research has been done in this area. The paper aims to understand how the adoption of IoT affects the spatial ramification of service offerings and service business. After the theoretical framework and research method, part three explains what the implications of IoT in service context are, why and how IoT enables innovation in services and the current obstacles. Part four further discusses what could be the spatial ramification with the case of China emerging IoT industry in the city of Wuxi.","Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Ctr Int Business Studies, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Xu, XX (corresponding author), Gothenburg Univ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Ctr Int Business Studies, S-41124 Gothenburg, Sweden.",emily.xu@handels.gu.se,,,,,,,47,10,11,1,79,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2012,14,,,,6,,698,719,,,,,,22,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,038UI,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000311199200009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The previous IS literature has failed to identify the central role of IT and Internet retailing-related technologies to explain the rigidity of prices on the Internet. Instead, it has offered only limited explanations, such as menu costs and tacit collusion. These ideas, and quite a few other key theoretical perspectives were formulated in disciplines other than ours. Thus, the issue of price rigidity and price adjustment in Internet retailing should be given more scrutiny than the literature has provided to date. We review and synthesize what we know about price rigidity in non-electronic retailing contexts using a multi-level theory approach that identifies three unique levels of analysis: the firm-specific level, the firm-to-consumer level, and the firm-to-market level. We evaluate to what extent this knowledge is applicable to explain price-setting and price adjustment on the Internet. We conclude that there should not be less price rigidity in Internet retailing than in traditional retailing - even though the Internet is involved. To this end, we recommend a multi-level variance theory of Internet-based price rigidity. This study provides a foundation for the development of new theoretical perspectives at the crossroads of the academic disciplines of marketing, economics and IS. It encourages research that is able to probe for a deeper understanding of new economic phenomena associated with the digital economy's growth.","[Lee, Dongwon] Korea Univ, Korea Univ Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea; [Kauffman, Robert J.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Korea University; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Lee, D (corresponding author), Korea Univ, Korea Univ Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea.",rkauffman@asu.edu; mislee@korea.ac.kr,"Lee, Dongwon/ABE-4551-2021; KAUFFMAN, Robert J/G-2767-2012","Lee, Dongwon/0000-0003-4826-1632",MIS Research Center at the University of Minnesota; Center for Advancing Business through Information Technology at Arizona State University; W.P.

VE reveals that more complex and dynamic business processes should be considered as assembled service components in order to integrate the collaborative business processes. Therefore, a formal standard schema for describing and managing the business processes is required. In this paper, we propose a consistent modeling approach that combines enterprise modeling and simulation modeling to design a value chain of a VE. This methodology will provide designers with insight into the business processes of a VE and help identify and resolve unpredictable bottlenecks on the execution of virtual business processes.

Ecological factors are evaluated to provide an overall comparison of the 2 business strategies over the product's life cycle. Of particular importance are factors relating to the distribution of products through their supply chains. This study's integrated modeling framework includes a simulation component to address the stochastic modeling environment caused by business uncertainty. Also included is an environmental input-output life cycle assessment model to quantify the full direct and indirect impacts of different business strategies. Outputs from this model include measures of electricity, natural gas, fuel and packaging expended, retail and warehouse space used, energy expenditures, vehicle emissions, and 20 different pollutants resulting from different business strategies.
