Advancements such as digital social platforms and mobile apps have helped to connect social actors, empower citizens, and enable diverse circular economy practices in cities. Paradoxically, technology is also contributing to loneliness, anxiety, and depression among urban populations, and raises nuanced questions about access and inclusivity in increasingly digitized urban settings. In this contribution, we consider the possibilities and challenges inherent in applying digital technologies to leverage the development of inclusive and diverse circular economic spaces around a city's reuse, repair and recycling infrastructure and drive socio-ecological transformations of urban spaces. We conclude that uneven access to digital tools potentially reinforces existing urban social inequalities, and that emphasis must be placed on understanding how technologies should be more effectively designed and leveraged for a socially inclusive circular economy in the city.","[Lekan, Malgorzata; Rogers, Heather A.] Dept Geog Geol & Environm, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",,"Lekan, M (corresponding author), Dept Geog Geol & Environm, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England.",M.Lekan@hull.ac.uk,"Pusz, Malgorzata/CAI-8588-2022","Pusz, Malgorzata/0000-0001-6299-335X; Rogers, Heather A./0000-0003-2373-5010",Horizon 2020 [765198],Horizon 2020(Horizon 2020),This work was supported by the Horizon 2020 [765198].,,14,15,15,9,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0272-3638,1938-2847,,URBAN GEOGR,Urban Geogr.,2020 JUL 2,2020,41,6,,,,,898,901,,10.1080/02723638.2020.1796097,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2020.1796097,,Jul-20,4,Geography; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geography; Urban Studies,OI0AJ,,Green Accepted,,,3/4/2024,WOS:000550698600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Circular Economy, however, is intrinsically linked to the innovation issue. It can occur in a productive and consumption system under the form of a new product, process, organizational or marketing model. In the meantime, the digital innovation ecosystem debate was enriched by the social and environmental sustainability perspectives that are the pillars of the Circular Economy theory. Despite this, the research has failed to achieve full comprehension of digital innovation ecosystems' dynamics and processes for the Circular Economy, by highlighting the need for deeper understanding. Under the above assumptions, this paper presents the evidence of a single and extreme case study related to the Italian Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform (ICESP). This is shown as good practice of a digital platform for stakeholders' engagement, supporting the creation of a digital innovation ecosystem focused on the Circular Economy. We conclude by deriving implications for researchers and policy makers' agendas.","[Vecchio, Pasquale Del; Passiante, Giuseppina] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Lecce, Italy; [Barberio, Grazia; Innella, Carolina] ENEA, Rome, Italy",University of Salento; Italian National Agency New Technical Energy & Sustainable Economics Development,"Del Vecchio, P (corresponding author), Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, Lecce, Italy.",pasquale.delvecchio@unisalento.it,"; DEL VECCHIO, PASQUALE/S-6616-2016","Innella, Carolina/0000-0002-3629-9759; DEL VECCHIO, PASQUALE/0000-0001-9791-3049",,,,,76,15,15,20,148,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0219-8770,1793-6950,,INT J INNOV TECHNOL,Int.
