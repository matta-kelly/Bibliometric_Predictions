The relationship between the concepts is not made explicit in literature, which is blurring their conceptual contours and constrains the efficacy of using the approaches in research and practice. This research addresses this gap and aims to provide conceptual clarity by distinguishing the terms and synthesising the different types of relationships between them. We conducted an extensive literature review, employing bibliometric analysis and snowballing techniques to investigate the state of the art in the field and synthesise the similarities, differences and relationships between both terms. We identified eight different relationship types in the literature and illustrated the most evident similarities and differences between both concepts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, critics claim that it means many different things to different people. This paper provides further evidence for these critics. The aim of this paper is to create transparency regarding the current understandings of the circular economy concept. For this purpose, we have gathered 114 circular economy definitions which were coded on 17 dimensions. Our findings indicate that the circular economy is most frequently depicted as a combination of reduce, reuse and recycle activities, whereas it is oftentimes not highlighted that CE necessitates a systemic shift. We further find that the definitions show few explicit linkages of the circular economy concept to sustainable development. The main aim of the circular economy is considered to be economic prosperity, followed by environmental quality; its impact on social equity and future generations is barely mentioned. Furthermore, neither business models nor consumers are frequently outlined as enablers of the circular economy. We critically discuss the various circular economy conceptualizations throughout this paper. Overall, we hope to contribute via this study towards the coherence of the circular economy concept; we presume that significantly varying circular economy definitions may eventually result in the collapse of the concept.","[Kirchherr, Julian; Reike, Denise; Hekkert, Marko] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies Grp, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Kirchherr, J (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Innovat Studies Grp, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands.",j.kirchherr@uu.nl,"Dijkstra, Tim/Z-1876-2019; Silva, Pamella/ABE-3142-2020; Hekkert, Marko/F-2528-2012",,,,,,111,2788,2931,158,1067,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

By promoting the adoption of closing-the-loop production patterns within an economic system CE aims to increase the efficiency of resource use, with special focus on urban and industrial waste, to achieve a better balance and harmony between economy, environment and society. This study provides an extensive review of the literature of last two decades, with the purpose of grasping the main CE features and perspectives: origins, basic principles, advantages and disadvantages, modelling and implementation of CE at the different levels (micro, meso and macro) worldwide. Results evidence that CE origins are mainly rooted in ecological and environmental economics and industrial ecology. In China CE is promoted as a top-down national political objective while in other areas and countries as European Union, Japan and USA it is a tool to design bottom-up environmental and waste management policies. The ultimate goal of promoting CE is the decoupling of environmental pressure from economic growth. The implementation of CE worldwide still seems in the early stages, mainly focused on recycle rather than reuse. Important results have been achieved in some activity sectors (e.g. in waste management, where large waste recycling rates are achieved in selected developed countries). CE implies the adoption of cleaner production patterns at company level, an increase of producers and consumers responsibility and awareness, the use of renewable technologies and materials (wherever possible) as well as the adoption of suitable, clear and stable policies and tools. The lesson learned from successful experiences is that the transition towards CE comes from the involvement of all actors of the society and their capacity to link and create suitable collaboration and exchange patterns. Success stories also point out the need for an economic return on investment, in order to provide suitable motivation to companies and investors. In summary, the CE transition has just started. Moreover, the interdisciplinary framework underpinning CE offers good prospects for gradual improvement of the present production and consumption models, no longer adequate because of their environmental load and social inequity, a clear indicator of resource use inefficiency.

However, the scientific and research content of the CE concept is superficial and unorganized. CE seems to be a collection of vague and separate ideas from several fields and semi scientific concepts. The objective of this article is to contribute to the scientific research on CE. First, we will define the concept of CE from the perspective of WCED sustainable development and sustainability science. Second, we will conduct a critical analysis of the concept from the perspective of environmental sustainability. The analysis identifies six challenges, for example those of thermodynamics and system boundaries, that need to be resolved for CE to be able to contribute to global net sustainability. These six challenges also serve as research themes and objectives for scholars interested in making progress in sustainable development through the usage of circular economy. CE is important for its power to attract both the business community and policy-making community to sustainability work, but it needs scientific research to secure that the actual environmental impacts of CE work toward sustainability.

Understanding the key drivers behind China's growing energy consumption and the associated CO2 emissions is critical for the development of global climate policies and provides insight into how other emerging economies may develop a low emissions future. Using recently released Chinese economic input-output data and structural decomposition analysis we analyze how changes in China's technology, economic structure, urbanization, and lifestyles affect CO2 emissions. We find that infrastructure construction and urban household consumption, both in turn driven by urbanization and lifestyle changes, have outpaced efficiency improvements in the growth Of CO2 emissions. Net trade had a small effect on total emissions due to equal, but significant, growth in emissions from the production of exports and emissions avoided by imports. Technology and efficiency improvements have only partially offset consumption growth, but there remains considerable untapped potential to reduce emissions by improving both production and consumption systems. As China continues to rapidly develop there is an opportunity to further implement and extend policies, such as the Circular Economy, that will help China avoid the high emissions path taken by today's developed countries.","Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; Carnegie Mellon Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; Univ Leeds, Sch Earth & Environm, Sustainabil Res Inst, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Carnegie Mellon University; University of Leeds,"Peters, GP (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",glen.peters@ntnu.no,"feng, tingting/A-9545-2012; Hubacek, Klaus/K-3500-2019; Hubacek, Klaus/GVS-6444-2022; Hertwich, Edgar G/D-2169-2011; Peters, Glen P/B-1012-2008; Guan, Dabo/Y-2406-2019","Hubacek, Klaus/0000-0003-2561-6090; Hertwich, Edgar G/0000-0002-4934-3421; Peters, Glen P/0000-0001-7889-8568; Guan, Dabo/0000-0003-3773-3403; Weber, Christopher/0000-0002-6245-525X",,,,,64,1246,1386,53,519,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

However the concept of circularity is not of novel as such. Specific circumstances and motivations have stimulated ideas relevant to circularity in the past through activities such as reuse, remanufacturing or recycling. Main objectives of this work are: to provide a comprehensive review of research efforts encompassing aspects of resources scarcity, waste generation and economic advantages; to explore the CE landscape in the context of these three aspects especially when they are considered simultaneously; based on an idea of a comprehensive CE framework, propose an implementation strategy using top-down and bottom-up approach in a concurrent manner. To fulfill this objective a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research is carried out to understand different ideas relevant to CE, motivation for the research and context of their recurrence. Main contributions of this paper are a comprehensive CE framework and a practical implementation strategy for a regenerative economy and natural environment. The framework emphasizes on a combined view of three main aspects i.e. environment, resources and economic benefits. It also underlines that joint support of all stakeholders is necessary in order to successfully implement the CE concept at large scale. The proposed framework and implementation strategy also identify new avenues for future research and practice in the field of CE. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Circular Economy represents the most recent attempt to conceptualize the integration of economic activity and environmental wellbeing in a sustainable way. This set of ideas has been adopted by China as the basis of their economic development (included in both the 11th and the 12th 'Five Year Plan'), escalating the concept in minds of western policymakers and NGOs. This paper traces the conceptualisations and origins of the Circular Economy, tracing its meanings, and exploring its antecedents in economics and ecology, and discusses how the Circular Economy has been operationalized in business and policy. The paper finds that while the Circular Economy places emphasis on the redesign of processes and cycling of materials, which may contribute to more sustainable business models, it also encapsulates tensions and limitations. These include an absence of the social dimension inherent in sustainable development that limits its ethical dimensions, and some unintended consequences. This leads us to propose a revised definition of the Circular Economy as an economic model wherein planning, resourcing, procurement, production and reprocessing are designed and managed, as both process and output, to maximize ecosystem functioning and human well-being.","[Murray, Alan] Winchester Business Sch, Hoare Chair Responsible Management, Romsey Rd, Winchester SO22 5HT, Hants, England; [Skene, Keith] Biosphere Res Inst, London, England; [Haynes, Kathryn] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Northern Soc Chair Accounting & Finance, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Murray, A (corresponding author), Winchester Business Sch, Hoare Chair Responsible Management, Romsey Rd, Winchester SO22 5HT, Hants, England.",alan.murray@winchester.ac.uk; krskene@biosri.org; kathryn.haynes@ncl.ac.uk,"SKENE, KEITH/JXY-3143-2024; Haynes, Kathryn/AAH-9186-2021","SKENE, KEITH/0000-0003-2141-7836; Haynes, Kathryn/0000-0003-4514-6436",ESRC [ES/M002470/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M002470/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,110,1236,1238,70,886,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

This paper reviews the literature on PSS in the last decade and compares the findings with those from an earlier review in this journal in 2006. Close to 300 relevant papers were identified, over 140 of which have been referenced in this review. Research in the field of PSS has become more prolific, with the output of refereed papers quadrupling since 2000, while on average scientific output has only doubled. PSS has also become embedded in a wider range of science fields (such as manufacturing, ICT, business management, and design) and geographical regions (Asia now produces more papers than Europe). The literature of the last seven years has refined insights with regard to the design of PSS, as well as their business and environmental benefits, and confirmed the definitions and PSS concepts already available in 2006. A major contribution of the recent literature is research into how firms have implemented PSS in their organization and what the key success factors and issues that require special attention are (such as a focus on product availability for clients; an emphasis on diversity in terms of services provided rather than the range of products; and the need for staff to possess both knowledge of the product and relationship management skills). The reasons why PSS have nonetheless still not been widely implemented, particularly in the B2C context, seem to have already been explained fairly well in the literature available in 2006. For consumers, having control over things, artifacts, and life itself is one of the most valued attributes. PSS are often less accessible, or have less intangible value, than the competing product, in part because PSS usually do not allow consumers as much behavioral freedom or even leave them with the impression that the PSS provider could prescribe how they should behave.

Currently, 35% of global lithium production being used for LIBs and consumption for estimated LIB demand could be 66% (out of global lithium production) by 2025. During last five (2011-2015) years, global lithium production is almost constant. At present, up to 3% of LIBs are recycled with the only focus of valuable metal recovery, but motivation on lithium recovery almost nonexistence. The global rate of lithium recycling is only < 1%. Considering the current global lithium production with respect to projected demand, environment and regulation, green energy and energy security, cradle-to-cradle technology management and circular economy of critical metal and minimization of waste crime and maximization of the urban mining, recovery and recycling status of lithium should be well understood. In this review recovery of lithium from various resources such as different ores, clay, brine, seawater and recycling of battery by different technique are reviewed. Lithium recovery from various primary resources and its separation purification by different routes such as hydrometallurgy, pyro-metallurgy, chemical metallurgy, and bioleaching are discussed. Lithium recovery through chemical leaching, bioleaching, and floatation of different ores also thoroughly reviewed. The extraction of lithium from seawater by co-precipitation and extraction, ion exchange and sorption by using various organic, inorganic and composite polymer sorbents has been discussed thoroughly. Although, several industries recovering lithium from primary resources, but lithium recovery from secondary resources almost non-existence. The non-existence of lithium recovery process from LIB or techno-economically inefficient process is a greater challenge for the projected lithium demand. As the cradle-to-grave technology is a sustainability challenge, cradle-to-cradle technology management could be achieved through efficient recycling. Hence, techno-economically feasible, environment-friendly and sustainable process needs to be developed and recommended. Considering technological advantages of hydrometallurgy process like; smaller scale, minimal energy investment, minimal CO2 emission, and the plant can be designed based on available waste, lithium recovery by hydrometallurgy should be focused.

To minimize the ecological implications associated with their wider use, we must integrate sustainability of battery materials into our research endeavours, choosing chemistries that have a minimum footprint in nature and that are more readily recycled or integrated into a full circular economy. Sustainability and cost concerns require that we greatly increase the battery lifetime and consider second lives for batteries. As part of this, we must monitor the state of health of batteries continuously during operation to minimize their degradation. It is thus important to push the frontiers of operando techniques to monitor increasingly complex processes. In this Review, we will describe key advances in both more sustainable chemistries and operando techniques, along with some of the remaining challenges and possible solutions, as we personally perceive them.","[Grey, C.

Following an introduction to the origins of green chemistry and the E factor concept, the various metrics for measuring greenness are discussed. It is emphasised that mass-based metrics such as atom economy, E factors and process mass intensity (PMI) need to be supplemented by metrics, in particular life cycle assessment, which measure the environmental impact of waste and, in order to assess sustainability, by metrics which measure economic viability. The role of catalysis in waste minimisation is discussed and illustrated with examples of green catalytic processes such as aerobic oxidations of alcohols, catalytic C-C bond formation and olefin metathesis. Solvent losses are a major source of waste in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries and solvent reduction and replacement strategies, including the possible use of neoteric solvents, such as ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents, are reviewed. Biocatalysis has many benefits in the context of green and sustainable chemistry and this is illustrated with recent examples in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients. The importance of the transition from an unsustainable economy based on fossil resources to a sustainable bio-based economy is delineated, as part of the overarching transition from an unsustainable linear economy to a truly green and sustainable circular economy based on resource efficiency and waste minimisation by design.","[Sheldon, Roger A.] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Chem, Inst Mol Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Sheldon, Roger A.] Delft Univ Technol, Biocatalysis & Organ Chem, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands",University of Witwatersrand; Delft University of Technology,"Sheldon, RA (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Chem, Inst Mol Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.;Sheldon, RA (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Biocatalysis & Organ Chem, NL-2628 BL Delft, Netherlands.",roger.sheldon@wits.ac.za,"Sheldon, Roger Arthur/ADM-3421-2022",,,,,,268,839,871,32,714,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9262,1463-9270,,GREEN CHEM,Green Chem.,JAN 7,2017,19,1,,,,,18,43,,10.1039/c6gc02157c,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6gc02157c,,,26,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,EH4GE,,,Y,N,2024-04-26,WOS:000391728900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

The activity of the informal sector in developing cities was also reviewed, focusing on the main health risks due to waste scavenging. Results reported that the environmental impacts are pervasive worldwide: marine litter, air, soil and water contamination, and the direct interaction of waste pickers with hazardous waste are the most important issues. Many reviews were published in the scientific literature about specific waste streams, in order to quantify its effect on the environment. This narrative literature review assessed global issues due to different waste fractions showing how several sources of pollution are affecting the environment, population health, and sustainable development. The results and case studies presented can be of reference for scholars and stakeholders for quantifying the comprehensive impacts and for planning integrated solid waste collection and treatment systems, for improving sustainability at a global level.","[Ferronato, Navarro; Torretta, Vincenzo] Univ Insubria, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Via GB Vico 46, I-21100 Varese, Italy",University of Insubria,"Ferronato, N (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Via GB Vico 46, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",nferronato@uninsubria.it; vincenzo.torretta@uninsubria.it,,"Ferronato, Navarro/0000-0001-7850-5461; Torretta, Vincenzo/0000-0002-7594-1169",Rotary Foundation [GG1758711]; Clubs Rotary Bassano del Grappa Castelli; Rotary Sopocachi La Paz,Rotary Foundation; Clubs Rotary Bassano del Grappa Castelli; Rotary Sopocachi La Paz,"This research was funded by The Rotary Foundation, grant number GG1758711 Scholarship provided by the Clubs Rotary Bassano del Grappa Castelli and Rotary Sopocachi La Paz.",,151,745,782,39,351,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This strategy, formally accepted in 2002, has been implemented and developed in a number of pilot areas in China. Scholars have produced rich studies in regard with the CE from its fundamental concept to its practical implementation. Successful enforcement of a CE can be seen as a way for China to tackle its urgent problem of environmental degradation and source scarcity. Given its importance, we provide a holistic literature review on the CE, aiming to provide a panorama of how this strategy has been developed and implemented. The review covers the concept, current practices, and assessment of the CE. To have a more numeric concept of how it has developed, we look at the performance of the CE in Dalian after its implementation of relevant policies and compare the changes with three other pilot cities, Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Based on an examination of the statistical results, we identified the underlying problems and challenges for this national strategy. Finally, we offer a conclusion regarding CE's development as well as policy recommendations for future improvement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The reasons for this are the huge financial, social and environmental benefits. However, the global shift from one model of economy to another also concerns smaller companies on a micro-level. Thus, comprehensive knowledge on designing circular business models is needed to stimulate and foster implementation of the circular economy. Existing business models for the circular economy have limited transferability and there is no comprehensive framework supporting every kind of company in designing a circular business model. This study employs a literature review to identify and classify the circular economy characteristics according to a business model structure. The investigation in the eight sub-domains of research on circular business models was used to redefine the components of the business model canvas in the context of the circular economy. Two new components-the take-back system and adoption factors-have been identified, thereby leading to the conceptualization of an extended framework for the circular business model canvas. Additionally, the triple fit challenge has been recognized as an enabler of the transition towards a circular business model. Some directions for further research have been outlined, as well.","[Lewandowski, Mateusz] Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Management & Social Commun, Inst Publ Affairs, Lojasiewicza 4, PL-31348 Krakow, Poland",Jagiellonian University,"Lewandowski, M (corresponding author), Jagiellonian Univ, Fac Management & Social Commun, Inst Publ Affairs, Lojasiewicza 4, PL-31348 Krakow, Poland.",mateusz.lewandowski@uj.edu.pl,,,,,,,90,741,768,66,730,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2016,8,1,,,,,,,43,10.3390/su8010043,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8010043,,,28,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DH0EV,,"gold, Green Submitted",Y,N,2024-04-26,WOS:000372456200043,View Full Record in Web of Science

In parallel to this, the circular economy discourse has been propagated in the industrial ecology literature and practice. Circular economy pushes the frontiers of environmental sustainability by emphasising the idea of transforming products in such a way that there are workable relationships between ecological systems and economic growth. Therefore, circular economy is not just concerned with the reduction of the use of the environment as a sink for residuals but rather with the creation of self-sustaining production systems in which materials are used over and over again. Through two case studies from different process industries (chemical and food), this paper compares the performances of traditional and circular production systems across a range of indicators. Direct, indirect and total lifecycle emissions, waste recovered, virgin resources use, as well as carbon maps (which provide a holistic visibility of the entire supply chain) are presented. The paper asserts that an integration of circular economy principles within sustainable supply chain management can provide clear advantages from an environmental point view. Emerging supply chain management challenges and market dynamics are also highlighted and discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Genovese, Andrea; Figueroa, Alejandro; Koh, S. C.

Most scholarly studies blame this on various technological barriers. Our work rebuts these studies. We present the first large-N-study on circular economy barriers in the EU (208 survey respondents, 47 expert interviews). We find that cultural barriers, particularly a lack of consumer interest and awareness as well as a hesitant company culture, are considered the main circular economy barriers by businesses and policy-makers. These are driven by market barriers which, in turn, are induced by a lack of synergistic governmental interventions to accelerate the transition towards a circular economy. Meanwhile, not a single technological barrier is ranked among the most pressing circular economy barriers, according to our research. Overall, our work suggests that circular economy is a niche discussion among sustainable development professionals at this stage.

We show that each of the currently available processes is applicable for specific plastic waste streams. Thus, only a combination of different technologies can address the plastic waste problem. Research should focus on more realistic, more contaminated and mixed waste streams, while collection and sorting infrastructure will need to be improved, that is, by stricter regulation.

After analyzing different CE approaches and the underlying principles the paper then proceeds with the main goal of developing tools for CE implementation. Two tools are presented. The first is a CE Strategies Database, which includes 45 CE strategies that are applicable to different parts of the value chain. The second is a CE Implementation Database, which includes over 100 case studies categorized by Scope, Parts of the Value Chain that are involved, as well as by the used Strategy and Implementation Level. An analysis of the state of the art in CE implementation is also included in the paper. One of the observations from the analysis is that while such Parts of the Value Chain as Recovery/Recycling and Consumption/Use are prominently featured, others, including Manufacturing and Distribution, are rarely involved in CE. On the other hand, the Implementation Levels of the used Strategies indicate that many market-ready solutions exist already. The Scope of current CE implementation considers selected products, materials and sectors, while system changes to economy are rarely suggested. Finally, the CE monitoring methods and suggestions for future development are also discussed in this paper. The analysis of the theoretical approaches can serve as an introduction to CE concept, while the developed tools can be instrumental for designing new CE cases.","[Kalmykova, Yuliya] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Sadagopan, Madumita] Univ Boras, Swedish Ctr Resource Recovery, S-50190 Boras, Sweden; [Rosado, Leonardo] Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden",Chalmers University of Technology; University of Boras; Chalmers University of Technology,"Kalmykova, Y (corresponding author), Chalmers Univ Technol, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, S-41296 Gothenburg, Sweden.",yuliya@chalmers.se; madumita.sadagopan@hb.se; rosado@chalmers.se,"Rosado, Leonardo/A-5303-2016","Rosado, Leonardo/0000-0002-1674-6785",,,,,133,673,689,42,514,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

The 'revival' of the circular economy has been accompanied by controversies and confusions across different actors in science and practice. With this article we attempt at contributing to advanced clarity in the field and providing a heuristic that is useful in practice. Initially, we take a focus on the historical development of the concept of circular economy and value retention options (ROs) for products and materials aiming for increased circularity. We propose to distinguish three phases in the evolution of the circular economy and argue that the concept - in its dominant framing - is not as new as frequently claimed. Having established this background knowledge, we give insights into 'how far we are' globally, with respect to the implementation of circularity, arguing that high levels of circularity have already been reached in different parts of the globe with regard to longer loop value retention options, such as energy recovery and recycling. Subsequently, we show that the confusion surrounding the circular economy is more far reaching. We summarize the divergent perspectives on retention options and unite the most common views a I0R typology. From our analyses, we conclude that policymakers and businesses should focus their efforts on realization of the more desirable, shorter loop retention options, like remanufacturing, refurbishing and repurposing - yet with a view on feasibility and overall system effects. Scholars, on the other hand, should assist the parties contributing to an increased circular economy in practice by taking up a more active role in attaining consensus in conceptualizing the circular economy.","[Reike, Denise; Vermeulen, Walter J.

The digital revolution is reshaping the way individuals live and work fundamentally, and the public remains optimistic regarding the opportunities Industry 4.0 may offer for sustainability. The present study contributes to the sustainability literature by systematically identifying the sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. In doing so, the study first reviews the fundamental design principles and technology trends of Industry 4.0 and introduces the architectural design of Industry 4.0. The study further draws on the interpretive structural modelling technique to model the contextual relationships among the Industry 4.0 sustainability functions. Results indicate that sophisticated precedence relationships exist among various sustainability functions of Industry 4.0. 'Matrice d'Impacts Croises Multiplication Appliquee aun Classement' (MICMAC) analysis reveals that economic sustainability functions such as production efficiency and business model innovation tend to be the more immediate outcome of Industry 4.0, which pays the way for development of more remote socioenvironmental sustainability functions of Industry 4.0 such as energy sustainability, harmful emission reduction, and social welfare improvement. This study can serve Industry 4.0 stakeholders - leaders in the public and private sectors, industrialists, and academicians - to better understand the opportunities that the digital revolution may offer for sustainability, and work together more closely to ensure that Industry 4.0 delivers the intended sustainability functions around the world as effectively, equally, and fairly as possible.

In developed countries, 42% of food waste is produced by households, while 39% losses occur in the food manufacturing industry, 14% in food service sector and remaining 5% in retail and distribution. Increasingly, industrial ecology concepts such as cradle to cradle and circular economy are considered leading principle for eco-innovation, aiming at zero waste economy in which waste are used as raw material for new products and applications. The large amount of waste produced by the food industry, in addition to being a great loss of valuable materials, also raises serious management problems, both from the economic and environmental point of view. Many of these residues, however, have the potential to be reused into other production systems, trough e.g. biorefineries. The present work focuses on the use of food waste coming from food manufacturing (FWm). Through extensive literature review, the authors present feasibility and constraints of applying industrial symbiosis in recovering waste from food processing, focusing on recycling (excluding energy recovery) of the solid and liquid waste from food processing industry. The main uses of functional ingredients derived from this transformation are presented and discussed, highlighting mainstream sectors of application, e.g. in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industry.

Although various advantages have been identified that emerge from the application of a circular economy, no concrete studies exist that investigate current state-of-the-art drivers, barriers and practices in this relevant field. An in-depth exploration of current practices would enhance the circular economy's significance and would help understand its present level of implementation. With this concern, this study provides an analysis of the drivers, barriers and practices that influence the implementation of the circular economy in the context of supply chains through a systematic review. In order to analyse the circular economy's level of implementation, we correlate stakeholders' perspectives with drivers, barriers, and practices; thus, a multi-perspective framework is proposed. From the results, it is evident that among various stakeholders, the governmental perspective has the maximum positive impact on the implementation of the circular economy in supply chains. Specifically, the circular economy can be promoted through laws, policies, risk reduction (through tax levies) and strict governance.","[Govindan, Kannan; Hasanagic, Mia] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Technol & Innovat, Ctr Sustainable Supply Chain Engn, Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Govindan, K (corresponding author), Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Technol & Innovat, Ctr Sustainable Supply Chain Engn, Odense, Denmark.",kgov@iti.sdu.dk,"Govindan, Kannan/M-5996-2017","Govindan, Kannan/0000-0002-6204-1196",,,,,109,635,652,57,465,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Despite being visionary and provocative in its message, the research on the CE concept is emerging. The two intertwined objectives of the paper are; first to identify, discuss and develop the various definitions provided by the emerging literature. Secondly, to suggest an initial research approach with which research on CE can be conducted. Our analysis shows that the existing CE work is mainly done on the practical and technical levels of the actual physical flows of materials and energy in production-consumption systems. The focus of the extant literature is on concrete metrics, tools, instruments and computations. Therefore, the basic assumptions concerning the values, societal structures, cultures, underlying world-views and the paradigmatic potential of CE remain largely unexplored. We argue that CE has already become what Gallie (1955) more than six decades ago termed as an essentially contested concept (ECC). The paper further suggests a model for CE research that helps in the categorization, classification and organization of research and investigation on CE. The model can help in limiting the observed unbalance and enhance the contribution of the CE approach to a more sustainable global society. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The results of a literature review and a matching exercise to determine the relationship between CE practices and SDG targets show that CE practices, potentially, can contribute directly to achieving a significant number of SDG targets. The strongest relationships exist between CE practices and the targets of SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 15 (Life on Land). The paper also explores synergies that can be created through CE practices among several of the SDG targets. Furthermore, it identifies several potential trade-offs between targets for decent work, safe working environments, human health and current CE practices relating to recycling of municipal waste, e-waste and wastewater, and provides suggestions how these can be overcome. The paper concludes that CE practices can be applied as a toolbox and specific implementation approaches for achieving a sizeable number of SDG targets. Further empirical research is necessary to determine which specific types of partnerships and means of implementation are required to apply CE practices in the SDG context.","[Schroeder, Patrick] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, Brighton & Hove, England; [Anggraeni, Kartika; Weber, Uwe] Collaborating Ctr Sustainable Consumpt & Prod CSC, SWITCH Asia Network Facil, Wuppertal, Germany",University of Sussex,"Schroeder, P (corresponding author), Studies Ringgold Stand Inst Green Transformat Clu, Inst Dev Studies, Lib Rd, Brighton BN1 9RE, E Sussex, England.",p.schroeder@ids.ac.uk,,,,,,,101,617,643,53,458,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

In the last two decades, these two metrics have been adopted worldwide by both academia and industry. The E factor has been refined to distinguish between simple and complete E factors, for example, and to define the system boundaries. Other mass-based metrics such as process mass intensity (PMI) and reaction mass efficiency (RME) have been proposed. However, mass-based metrics need to be augmented by metrics which measure the environmental impact of waste, such as life cycle assessment (LCA), and metrics for assessing the economic viability of products and processes. The application of such metrics in measuring the sustainability of processes for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals is discussed in detail. Mass-based metrics alone are not sufficient to measure the greenness and sustainability of processes for the conversion of renewable biomass vs fossil-based feedstocks. Various metrics for use in assessing sustainability of the manufacture of basic chemicals from renewable biomass are discussed. The development of a sustainable biobased production of chemicals meshes well with the concept of a circular economy, based on resource efficiency and waste minimization by design, to replace traditional linear, take make use dispose economies.","[Sheldon, Roger A.] Univ Witwatersrand, Mol Sci Inst, Sch Chem, PO Wits, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa; [Sheldon, Roger A.] Delft Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Sect BOC, van der Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands",University of Witwatersrand; Delft University of Technology,"Sheldon, RA (corresponding author), Univ Witwatersrand, Mol Sci Inst, Sch Chem, PO Wits, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.;Sheldon, RA (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Dept Biotechnol, Sect BOC, van der Maasweg 9, NL-2629 HZ Delft, Netherlands.",roger.sheldon@wits.ac.za,"Sheldon, Roger Arthur/ADM-3421-2022","Sheldon, Roger/0000-0001-6867-2119",,,,,122,615,638,27,367,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",2168-0485,,,ACS SUSTAIN CHEM ENG,ACS Sustain.

This article therefore contributes to the literature by unveiling how different Industry 4.0 technologies could underpin CE strategies, and to organisations by addressing those technologies as a basis for sustainable operations management decision-making. The main results of this work are: (a) a discussion on the mutually beneficial relationship between Industry 4.0 and the CE; (b) an in-depth understanding of the potential contributions of smart production technologies to the ReSOLVE model of CE business models; (c) a research agenda for future studies on the integration between Industry 4.0 and CE principles based on the most relevant management theories.","[Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Ana Beatriz; Chiappetta Jabbour, Charbel Jose; Roubaud, David] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34000 Montpellier, France; [Godinho Filho, Moacir] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Prod Engn, Via Washington Luiz,Km 235, BR-13565905 Sao Carlos, SP, Brazil",Montpellier Business School; Universite de Montpellier; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos,"Jabbour, ABLD (corresponding author), Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier Res Management, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34000 Montpellier, France.",a.sousa-jabbour@montpellier-bs.com; c.chiappetta-jabbour@montpellier-bs.com; moacir@dep.ufscar.br; d.roubaud@montpellier-bs.com,"ROUBAUD, DAVID/ABA-8123-2020; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Ana Beatriz/B-8966-2012; CHIAPPETTA JABBOUR, Charbel Jose/F-3505-2010; Godinho Filho, Moacir/I-5099-2013","ROUBAUD, DAVID/0000-0003-3827-6187; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Ana Beatriz/0000-0001-6423-8868; CHIAPPETTA JABBOUR, Charbel Jose/0000-0002-6143-4924; Godinho Filho, Moacir/0000-0001-6150-1333",,,,,63,599,607,42,591,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0254-5330,1572-9338,,ANN OPER RES,Ann.

A systematic literature review,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,Circular economy; Sustainability; Industrial ecology; Systematic literature review; Circular business model,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; INDUSTRIAL SYMBIOSIS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; ANAEROBIC-DIGESTION; MATERIAL FLOW; PRODUCT; RESOURCE; PERFORMANCE,"Circular Economy (CE) aims to overcome the take-make-dispose linear pattern of production and consumption, proposing a circular system in which the value of products, materials and resources is maintained in the economy as long as possible. In recent years there has been a proliferation of scholars' publications on the topic. This study presents the results of a systematic literature review exploring the state-of-the-art of academic research on CE. The paper examines the CE body of literature with a systematic approach, to provide an exhaustive analysis of the phenomenon with rigorous and reproducible research criteria. The revisited material consists of 565 articles collected through the Web of Science and Scopus databases, and has been evaluated using specific structural dimensions to group literature into analytical categories. Starting from being a concept studied in connection with industrial ecology, CE has slowly acquired its independent role in academic research, framed mainly into environmental sustain ability related studies. As a result of policies implementation, academic production is mainly concentrated in China and Europe, employing tools and methods for modelling processes and supporting decision-making for CE implementation (e.g. Life Cycle Assessment and Material Flow Analysis). CE studies follow three main lines of action: the first aims to change the social and economic dynamics at macro and administrative level; the second to support firms in circular processes implementation at micro level to spread new forms of consumption and product design; the third, developed at meso level, discusses industrial symbiosis experiences. CE is associated with a variety of concepts, and waste management emerges as the most relevant sub-sector. CE is also strongly connected with the concept of sustainability, proposing ways to operationalize its implementation at the environmental and economic level, while scholars only marginally consider social and institutional implications. The most explored practices are those related to cleaner production, aiming at reducing environmental impact and waste production along the life cycle of a product, and optimizing the performance and efficiency of processes. Conversely, studies on CE may devote greater attention to strategies for social and institutional changes, able to transform the upstream process of production and consumption. Considering business model strategies, scholars mainly focus on studying closing material loops strategy, while slowing the loops, which requires a radical change of consumption and production patterns, is only marginally included with respect to CE implementation. This study's findings highlight CE as an evolving concept that still requires development to consolidate its definition, boundaries, principles and associated practices. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The circular economy (CE) is a simple, but convincing, strategy, which aims at reducing both input of virgin materials and output of wastes by closing economic and ecological loops of resource flows. This article applies a sociometabolic approach to assess the circularity of global material flows. All societal material flows globally and in the European Union (EU-27) are traced from extraction to disposal and presented for main material groups for 2005. Our estimate shows that while globally roughly 4 gigatonnes per year (Gt/yr) of waste materials are recycled, this flow is of moderate size compared to 62Gt/yr of processed materials and outputs of 41Gt/yr. The low degree of circularity has two main reasons: First, 44% of processed materials are used to provide energy and are thus not available for recycling. Second, socioeconomic stocks are still growing at a high rate with net additions to stocks of 17Gt/yr. Despite having considerably higher end-of-life recycling rates in the EU, the overall degree of circularity is low for similar reasons. Our results indicate that strategies targeting the output side (end of pipe) are limited given present proportions of flows, whereas a shift to renewable energy, a significant reduction of societal stock growth, and decisive eco-design are required to advance toward a CE.","[Haas, Willi; Krausmann, Fridolin; Wiedenhofer, Dominik; Heinz, Markus] Alpen Adria Univ, IFF Fac Interdisciplinary Studies, Inst Social Ecol SEC, A-1070 Vienna, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Haas, W (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ, Fac Interdisciplinary Studies, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, Schottenfeldgasse 29, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",willi.haas@aau.at,"Krausmann, Fridolin/N-1918-2015; Wiedenhofer, Dominik/AAA-5678-2020; Haas, Willi/M-4120-2018","Krausmann, Fridolin/0000-0002-9995-2372; Wiedenhofer, Dominik/0000-0001-7418-3477; Haas, Willi/0000-0001-5599-9227","European Commission [266833]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P21012 G11, MISO P27590]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 21012] Funding Source: researchfish; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P27590, P21012] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF)",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding from the European Commission for the project NEUJOBS (EU-FP7 project 266833) and the Austrian Science Fund (FWF; Project Glometra, P21012 G11 and project MISO P27590).",,64,564,588,10,317,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

We realize this goal by anchoring the CE concept in this broader debate through a narrative approach. This leads to the insight that whereas the various resource strategies grouped under the CE's banner are not new individually, the concept offers a new framing of these strategies by drawing attention to their capacity of prolonging resource use as well as to the relationship between these strategies. As such, the CE offers a new perspective on waste and resource management and provides a new cognitive unit and discursive space for debate. We conclude by discussing research opportunities for the industrial ecology (IE) community relating to the concept's theoretical development and its implementation. Specifically, we pose that reinvigorating and growing the social science aspects of IE is required for both. After all, it is in understanding and facilitating the collective implementation of any idea, also the CE concept, that the potential lies for shaping our material future.","[Blomsma, Fenna; Brennan, Geraldine] Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, 13-15 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Brennan, Geraldine] Middlesex Univ, Ctr Enterprise & Econ Dev Res, Business Sch, London, England",Imperial College London; Middlesex University,"Blomsma, F (corresponding author), Imperial Coll London, Ctr Environm Policy, 13-15 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England.",f.blomsma12@imperial.ac.uk,,"Blomsma, Fenna/0000-0002-0996-4717",ESRC Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP) [ES/M010163/1]; Climate-KIC; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010163/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/M010163/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Climate-KIC; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research has been funded, in part, by Climate-KIC, created by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (Regulation (EU) No 1292/2013), the EPSRC National Centre for Industrial Sustainability (RG64858), and the ESRC Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP) (Grant number ES/M010163/1).",,121,544,565,11,129,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

At the same time, however, various barriers pose challenges to small businesses in their transition to a circular economy, namely a lack of financial resources and lack of technical skills. The aim of this paper is to increase knowledge and understanding about the barriers and enablers experienced by SMEs when implementing circular economy business models. Looking first at the barriers that prevent SMEs from realising the benefits of the circular economy, an investigation is carried out in the form of a literature review and an analysis of a sample of SME case studies that are featured on the GreenEcoNet EU-funded web platform. Several enabling factors that help SMEs adopt circular economy practices are then identified. The paper concludes that although various policy instruments are available to help SMEs incorporate circular economy principles into their business models, several barriers remain. The authors recommend that European and national policies strengthen their focus on greening consumer preferences, market value chains and company cultures, and support the recognition of SMEs' green business models. This can be achieved through the creation of dedicated marketplaces and communities of practice, for example.","[Rizos, Vasileios; Behrens, Arno] CEPS, Pl Congres 1, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium; [van der Gaast, Wytze; Hofman, Erwin] JIN Climate & Sustainabil, Laan Corpus Hoorn 300, NL-9728 JT Groningen, Netherlands; [Ioannou, Anastasia; Flamos, Alexandros; Papadelis, Sotiris] Univ Piraeus UNIPI, Dept Ind Management & Technol, 80 Karaoli & Dimitriou St, Piraeus 18534, Greece; [Kafyeke, Terri; Hirschnitz-Garbers, Martin] Inst Ecol, Pfalzburger Str 43-44, D-10717 Berlin, Germany; [Rinaldi, Roberto; Topi, Corrado] Univ York, Stockholm Environm Inst, York YO10 5NG, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Rizos, V (corresponding author), CEPS, Pl Congres 1, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium.",vasileios.rizos@ceps.eu; arno.behrens@ceps.eu; wytze@jin.ngo; erwin@jin.ngo; anast@unipi.gr; terri.kafyeke@ecologic.eu; aflamos@unipi.gr; roberto.rinaldi@sei-international.org; sotpapa@unipi.gr; martin.hirschnitz-garbers@ecologic.eu; corrado.topi@york.ac.uk,"Hirschnitz-Garbers, Martin/ABD-3201-2020","Rizos, Vasileios/0000-0001-6755-7565",European Union [603939]; EC FP7 post-grant OA publishing funds,European Union(European Union (EU)); EC FP7 post-grant OA publishing funds,"The research carried out for this paper has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration under grant agreement No. 603939, GREENECONET project.

In order to deal with this problem, the circular economy (CE) has been chosen as a national policy for sustainable development. National laws and regulations have been enacted to facilitate the implementation of CE and national CE demonstration projects have been initiated such that national benchmarking activities could be completed. China is the first country to release nationally focused CE indicators so that objective and credible information on the status of CE implementation can be recognized. These CE indicators are valuable metrics for policy and decision-makers and can help achieve CE goals and outcomes. This unique indicator system has not been communicated to international communities. This paper aims to more broadly introduce this unique national CE indicator system. China's CE efforts are first detailed with various provisions of the national indicator system. A critical analysis of such an indicator system is presented. We show that certain benefits can be gained, but substantive revision is also needed due to the lack of a comprehensive set of sustainability indicators which should include social, business indicators, urban/industrial symbiosis, absolute material/energy reduction, and prevention-oriented indicators. Concerns related to barriers on implementation are also presented in this paper. The knowledge gained from Chinese efforts on CE indicators are valuable to both developed and developing nations seeking to implement sustainable development measures within their regulatory policies.

Transitioning to a circular economy that retains plastic in its highest value condition is essential to reduce environmental impacts, promoting reduction, reuse, and recycling. Mechanical recycling is an essential tool in an environmentally and economically sustainable economy of plastics, but current mechanical recycling processes are limited by cost, degradation of mechanical properties, and inconsistent quality products. This review covers the current methods and challenges for the mechanical recycling of the five main packaging plastics: poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and poly(vinyl chloride) through the lens of a circular economy.

Given the large number of studies done on the circular economy, their differing approaches and their multiple applications, this paper attempts to propose a consensus view of the basic notions of the circular economy framework and highlight its relationship with eco-innovation. To that end, this study carried out a systematic literature review that resulted in four main outputs: a knowledge map of the circular economy, an analysis of the main notions of the concept, principles, and determinants of a circular economy. Finally, this study brings to light some remarkable examples of eco-innovations developed for implementation in the circular economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

As part of the solution, the development of biodegradable polymers, which constitute a class of green polymers according to green chemistry principles, has been intensively pursued in the past two decades. However, the degradation of such polymers in Earth's landfills typically leads to no recovery of the materials' value, and their degradation in the Oceans could create new or unintended environmental consequences. Industrial mechanical recycling always suffers from a significant quality loss. The proposed more sustainable solution is to develop chemically recyclable polymers that not only solve the end-of-life issue of polymers, but also provide a direct approach to establish a circular materials economy. Accordingly, this critical review article captures some selected highlights of the emerging area of recyclable green polymers by focusing on the major progress made and the technical and environmental benefits obtained in the development of repurposing and depolymerization processes for chemical recycling of polymers at the end of their useful life.","[Hong, Miao] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, State Key Lab Organometall Chem, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China; [Chen, Eugene Y. -X.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, CAS; Colorado State University","Hong, M (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Inst Organ Chem, State Key Lab Organometall Chem, Shanghai 200032, Peoples R China.;Chen, EYX (corresponding author), Colorado State Univ, Dept Chem, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",miaohong@sioc.ac.cn; eugene.chen@colostate.edu,,"Hong, Miao/0000-0003-1016-882X","Thousand Young Talents Plan - Central Government of China; SIOC; US National Science Foundation [NSF-1300267, NSF-1664915]",Thousand Young Talents Plan - Central Government of China; SIOC; US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"This work was supported by the Thousand Young Talents Plan Sponsored by the Central Government of China and the startup funds provided by SIOC to MH, and by the US National Science Foundation (NSF-1300267 and NSF-1664915) to EYC.",,110,506,536,61,580,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9262,1463-9270,,GREEN CHEM,Green Chem.,AUG 21,2017,19,16,,,,,3692,3706,,10.1039/c7gc01496a,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7gc01496a,,,15,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,FD6KQ,,,Y,N,2024-04-26,WOS:000407637800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The three concepts are currently mainstreamed in academia and policy making as key sustainability avenues, but a comparative analysis of such concepts is missing. The aim of this article is thus to comprehensively analyse the diversity within and between such concepts. The results are drawn from a bibliometric review of almost two thousand scientific articles published within the last three decades, coupled with a conceptual analysis. We find that, for what concerns environmental sustainability, Green Economy acts as an 'umbrella' concept, including elements from Circular Economy and Bioeconomy concepts (e.g. eco-efficiency; renewables), as well as additional ideas, e.g. nature-based solutions. In particular, Circular Economy and Bioeconomy are resource-focused, whereas in principle Green Economy acknowledges the underpinning role of all ecological processes. Regarding the social dimension, Green Economy is more inclusive of some aspects at local level (e.g. eco-tourism, education), while there is an emerging discussion in Bioeconomy literature around local processes in terms of biosecurity and rural policies. When considering weak/strong sustainability visions, all concepts remain limited in questioning economic growth. By comparing the different sustainability strategies promoted by these concepts we do not advocate for their substitutability, but for their clarification and reciprocal integration. The findings are discussed in light of the concepts' synergies and limits, with the purpose to inform research and policy implementation. (C) 2017 The Authors.

An economic system that minimises resource input into and waste, emission, and energy leakage out of the system is hoped to mitigate negative impacts without jeopardising growth and prosperity. This paper discusses the sustainability performance of the circular business models (CBM) and circular supply chains necessary to implement the concept on an organisational level and proposes a framework to integrate circular business models and circular supply chain management towards sustainable development. It was developed based on literature analysis and four case studies. The proposed framework shows how different circular business models are driving circular supply chain in different loops: closing loops, slowing loops, intensifying loops, narrowing loops, and dematerialising loops. The identified circular business models vary in complexity of the circular supply chain and in the value proposition. Our research indicates circular business and circular supply chain help in realising sustainability ambitions.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to this debate by analysing evidence regarding the different factors helping and hampering the development of a CE. Specifically, this paper focuses on the eco-innovation (EI) pathway towards a CE, and tries to coordinate available but fragmented findings regarding how transformative innovation can foster this transition while removing obstacles to sustainability. Drawing upon a new corpus of both academic and non-academic literature, this work offers a framework for analysis, as well as an evidence-based survey of the challenges, for a green structural change of the economy. We argue that the combination of the innovation systems' view with the more recent transformation turn in innovation studies may provide an appropriate perspective for understanding the transition to a CE. Ultimately, the paper aims to capitalise on these insights to contribute to the design of policy guidelines and organisational strategies.","[de Jesus, Ana] Univ Nova Lisboa, CENSE, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendonca, Sandro] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Business Res Unit BRU IUL, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendonca, Sandro] UECE ISEG, Res Unit Complex & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Mendonca, Sandro] Univ Sussex, Business SPRU, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; University of Sussex,"de Jesus, A (corresponding author), Univ Nova Lisboa, CENSE, Lisbon, Portugal.",aij.silva@fct.unl.pt; smfm@iscte.pt,"Johannesdottir, Solveig L/U-2219-2017","Johannesdottir, Solveig L/0000-0002-4402-6830; de Jesus, Ana/0000-0002-6468-0039; Mendonca, Sandro/0000-0001-7276-9626","Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation [Pest-OE/AMB/UI4085/2013, UID/GES/00315/2013, SFRH/BD/52295/2013]",Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This work was supported by the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation Grant Ref: SFRH/BD/52295/2013.

The recycling of Electric or electronic waste (E-waste) products could allow the diminishing use of virgin resources in manufacturing and, consequently, it could contribute in reducing the environmental pollution. Given that EU is trying, since the last two decades, to develop a circular economy based on the exploitation of resources recovered by wastes, a comprehensive framework supporting the decision-making process of multi-WEEE recycling centres will be analysed in this paper. An economic assessment will define the potential revenues coming from the recovery of 14 e-products (e.g. LCD notebooks, LED notebooks, CRT TVs, LCD TVs, LED TVs, CRT monitors, LCD monitors, LED monitors, cell phones, smart phones, PV panels, HDD5, SSD5 and tablets) on the base of current and future disposed volumes in Europe. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis will be used to test the impact of some critical variables (e.g. price of recovered materials, input materials composition, degree of purity obtained by the recycling process, volumes generated, and percentage of collected waste) on specific economic indexes. A discussion of the economic assessment results shows the main challenges in the recycling sector and streamlines some concrete solutions. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

CDW is usually randomly dumped or disposed in landfills and the average recycling rate of CDW in China is only about 5%. Considering there is big challenge in adoption of circular economy in CDW industry in China while related research is still limited, we conduct the CDW management analysis through 3R principle. Existing policies and management situations were investigated and analyzed based on the reduction, reuse and recycle principles. Results reveal that primary barriers of reducing CDW in China include lack of building design standard for reducing CDW, low cost for CDW disposal and inappropriate urban planning. Barriers to reuse CDW include lack of guidance for effective CDW collection and sorting, lack of knowledge and standard for reused CDW, and an under-developed market for reused CDW. As for recycling of CDW, key challenges are identified as ineffective management system, immature recycling technology, under-developed market for recycled CDW products and immature recycling market operation. Proposals to improve the current situation based on 3R principle are also proposed, including designing effective circular economy model, reinforcing the source control of CDW, adopting innovative technologies and market models, and implementing targeted economic incentives.","[Huang, Beijia; Wang, Xiangyu] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Coll Environm & Architecture, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Beijia] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Dept Environm & Low Carbon Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Kua, Harnwei] Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Bldg, Singapore, Singapore; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, China Inst Urban Governance, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Bleischwitz, Raimund] UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, London, England; [Ren, Jingzheng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Syst Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; National University of Singapore; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of London; University College London; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Huang, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Coll Environm & Architecture, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",ywhbjia@163.com,"Geng, Yong/B-6310-2018; Ren, Jingzheng/ABF-5240-2020; Bleischwitz, Raimund/JJF-2415-2023","Geng, Yong/0000-0002-2284-1375; Ren, Jingzheng/0000-0002-9690-5183; Bleischwitz, Raimund/0000-0001-8164-733X; huang, beijia/0000-0002-8325-7447","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403170, 71461137008, 71325006, 71690241]; ESRC [ES/L015838/1]; ESRC [ES/L015838/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L015838/1] Funding Source: researchfish",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research work of this paper was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71403170, 71461137008, 71325006, 71690241), and the ESRC et al. funded SINCERE project (ES/L015838/1).",,40,495,514,55,467,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

CE is an umbrella concept incorporating different meanings. Despite the unclear concept, CE is turned into defined action plans supported by specific indicators. To understand what indicators used in CE measure specifically, we propose a classification framework to categorise indicators according to reasoning on what (CE strategies) and how (measurement scope), Despite different types, CE strategies can be grouped according to their attempt to preserve functions, products, components, materials, or embodied energy; additionally, indicators can measure the linear economy as a reference scenario. The measurement scope shows how indicators account for technological cycles with or without a Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) approach; or their effects on environmental, social, or economic dimensions. To illustrate the classification framework, we selected quantitative micro scale indicators from literature and macro scale indicators from the European Union 'CE monitoring framework'. The framework illustration shows that most of the indicators focus on the preservation of materials, with strategies such as recycling. However, micro scale indicators can also focus on other CE strategies considering LCT approach, while the European indicators mostly account for materials often without taking LCT into account. Furthermore, none of the available indicators can assess the preservation of functions instead of products, with strategies such as sharing platforms, schemes for product redundancy, or multifunctionality. Finally, the framework illustration suggests that a set of indicators should be used to assess CE instead of a single indicator.","[Moraga, Gustavo; Huysveld, Sophie; Dewulf, Jo] Univ Ghent, Dept Green Chem & Technol, Coupure Links 653, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [de Meester, Steven] Univ Ghent, Dept Green Chem & Technol, Graaf Karel Goedelaan 5, B-8500 Kortrijk, Belgium; [Mathieux, Fabrice; Blengini, Gian Andrea] European Commiss, Sustainable Resources Directorate, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy; [Alaerts, Luc; Van Acker, Karel] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Mat Engn, Kasteelpk Arenberg 44, B-3001 Leuven, Belgium",Ghent University; Ghent University; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; KU Leuven,"Mathieux, F (corresponding author), European Commiss, Sustainable Resources Directorate, Joint Res Ctr, Via E Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, Italy.",fabrice.mathieux@ec.europa.eu,"Dewulf, Jo/HPG-9407-2023; blengini, gian andrea/C-1325-2013; Van Acker, Karel/E-6481-2011","Van Acker, Karel/0000-0002-5320-8839; Blengini, Gian Andrea/0000-0002-7977-1363; Moraga, Gustavo/0000-0001-6775-1456; De Meester, Steven/0000-0002-5246-3918; Alaerts, Luc/0000-0002-6640-6287",Flemish administration of Belgium via the Steunpunt Circulaire Economie (Policy Research Centre Circular Economy),Flemish administration of Belgium via the Steunpunt Circulaire Economie (Policy Research Centre Circular Economy),The authors are very grateful for full financial support received from the Flemish administration of Belgium via the Steunpunt Circulaire Economie (Policy Research Centre Circular Economy).

In this perspective, a biorefinery concept visualizes negative-valued waste as a potential renewable feedstock. This review illustrates different bioprocess based technological models that will pave sustainable avenues for the development of biobased society. The proposed models hypothesize closed loop approach wherein waste is valorised through a cascade of various biotechnological processes addressing circular economy.

The growth of population and rising standards of living means that the consumption of goods and energy is increasing. On the one hand, consumption leads to an increase in the generation of waste. On the other hand, the correlation between increased wealth and increased energy consumption is very strong as well. Given that the average heating value of municipal solid waste (MSW) is approximately 10 MJ/kg, it seems logical to use waste as a source of energy. Traditionally, waste-to-energy (WtE) has been associated with incineration. Yet, the term is much broader, embracing various waste treatment processes generating energy (for instance, in the form of electricity and/or heat or producing a waste derived fuel). Turning waste into energy can be one key to a circular economy enabling the value of products, materials, and resources to be maintained on the market for as long as possible, minimising waste and resource use. As the circular economy is at the top of the EU agenda, all Member States of the EU (including the EEA countries) should move away from the old-fashioned disposal of waste to a more intelligent waste treatment encompassing the circular economy approach in their waste policies. Therefore, the article examines how these EU policies are implemented in practice. Given that WtE traditionally is attached to the MSW management and organisation, the focus of this article is twofold. Firstly, it aims to identify the different practices of municipal waste management employed in selected countries and their approaches in embracing the circular economy and, secondly, the extent to which WtE technologies play any role in this context. The following countries, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and the UK were chosen to depict a broad European context. (C) 2017 The Authors.

While recycling and the circular economy have been touted as potential solutions, upward of half of the plastic waste intended for recycling has been exported to hundreds of countries around the world. China, which has imported a cumulative 45% of plastic waste since 1992, recently implemented a new policy banning the importation of most plastic waste, begging the question of where the plastic waste will go now. We use commodity trade data for mass and value, region, and income level to illustrate that higher-income countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation have been exporting plastic waste (70% in 2016) to lower-income countries in the East Asia and Pacific for decades. An estimated 111 million metric tons of plastic waste will be displaced with the new Chinese policy by 2030. As 89% of historical exports consist of polymer groups often used in single-use plastic food packaging (polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate), bold global ideas and actions for reducing quantities of nonrecyclable materials, redesigning products, and funding domestic plastic waste management are needed.","[Brooks, Amy L.; Wang, Shunli; Jambeck, Jenna R.] Univ Georgia, Coll Engn, New Mat Inst, Riverbend Res Lab South, 220 Riverbend Rd, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Jambeck, JR (corresponding author), Univ Georgia, Coll Engn, New Mat Inst, Riverbend Res Lab South, 220 Riverbend Rd, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",jjambeck@uga.edu,"Wang, Shunli/H-8729-2018; Jambeck, Jenna/C-3357-2018","Brooks, Amy/0000-0002-9949-579X; Jambeck, Jenna/0000-0003-1248-7218",UGA; UGA Teaching Assistantship,UGA; UGA Teaching Assistantship,This work was conducted at the UGA without specific project funding.

The idea of substituting lower-impact secondary production for environmentally intensive primary production gives the circular economy a strong intuitive environmental appeal. However, proponents of the circular economy have tended to look at the world purely as an engineering system and have overlooked the economic part of the circular economy. Recent research has started to question the core of the circular economy-namely, whether closing material and product loops does, in fact, prevent primary production. In this article, we argue that circular economy activities can increase overall production, which can partially or fully offset their benefits. Because there is a strong parallel in this respect to energy efficiency rebound, we have termed this effect circular economy rebound. Circular economy rebound occurs when circular economy activities, which have lower per-unit-production impacts, also cause increased levels of production, reducing their benefit. We describe the mechanisms that cause circular economy rebound, which include the limited ability of secondary products to substitute for primary products, and price effects. We then offer some potential strategies for avoiding circular economy rebound. However, these strategies are unlikely to be attractive to for-profit firms, so we caution that simply encouraging private firms to find profitable opportunities in the circular economy is likely to cause rebound and lower or eliminate the potential environmental benefits.","[Zink, Trevor] Loyola Marymount Univ, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA; [Geyer, Roland] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Loyola Marymount University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Zink, T (corresponding author), Loyola Marymount Univ, Dept Management, 1 LMU Dr, Los Angeles, CA 90045 USA.",trevor.zink@lmu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation (NSF) Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) [1335478]; Directorate For Engineering [1335478] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys [1335478] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","This research was funded by National Science Foundation (NSF) Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) grant #1335478.",,51,472,493,46,403,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

A central theme of the CE concept is the valuation of materials within a closed-looped system with the aim to allow for natural resource use while reducing pollution or avoiding resource constraints and sustaining economic growth. The objectives of this study are (1) to review the history of the CE concept to provide a context for (2) a critical examination of how it is applied currently. Thematic categories are used to organize the literature review of current applications including policy instruments and approaches; value chains, material flows, and products; and technology, organizational, and social innovation. The literature review illustrates the variability in CE project success and failure over time and by region. CE successes, key challenges, and research gaps are identified. The literature review results provide useful information for researchers as well as multi-stakeholder groups who seek to define the CE concept in practical terms, and to consider potential challenges and opportunities it presents when implemented.","[Winans, K.; Kendall, A.; Deng, H.] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Winans, K (corresponding author), Univ Calif Davis, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",kswinans@ucdavis.edu,"Deng, HJing/ISU-8991-2023","Kendall, Alissa/0000-0003-1964-9080; Winans, Kiara/0000-0002-2656-8839",,,,,137,467,487,33,614,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

In the praxis of governance, a common way to steer the transition to a different state proceeds through the setting of targets. Thus far, no study has investigated circular economy targets in a systematic way. To bridge this gap, this study examines which targets can facilitate the transition towards a circular economy. The analysis focuses both on existing and new targets; the latter complement existing targets which are limited to a few discrete cases addressing only partially the goal of a more circular economy. A framework based on 10 common circular economy strategies (i.e. recover, recycling, repurpose, remanufacture, refurbish, repair, re-use, reduce, rethink, refuse) is applied to scrutinise the selected targets. The study clarifies that existing targets for recovery and recycling do not necessarily promote a circular economy, though they are the most commonly applied targets so far. Because of lack of efficacy of recovery and recycling, targets should instead favour other more powerful circular economy strategies. In relation to these, the study looks into new and existing targets showing how they can reduce waste, increase efficiency, close production loops, and maximise retention of the economic value of materials and products. In particular, the study proposes an expanded set of brand new targets for the transition to a circular economy together with a fresh view on targets aimed at scholars and decision-makers alike.","[Morseletto, Piero] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Boelelaan 1087, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Morseletto, P (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Earth & Life Sci, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Boelelaan 1087, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",piero.morseletto@vu.nl,"Morseletto, Piero/N-2142-2019","Morseletto, Piero/0000-0002-5921-4471",,,,,124,466,479,141,696,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

In this respect, the fashion of Circular Economy is in the fact that it aims at overcoming the dominant linear take, make, disposal economy model, i.e. a traditional open-ended economy model developed with no built-in tendency to recycle, which is reflected by treating the environment as a waste reservoir (Su et al., 2013). Circular Economy, indeed, bases on the establishment of closed production systems, where resources are reused and kept in a loop of production and usage, allowing generating more value and for a longer period. Despite the interest for Circular Economy by politicians and practitioners, scholars, particularly in the strategic management field, are still struggling with a lack of a framework explaining how companies willing to become circular adapt their existing business model or create a new one. By extensively reviewing, through the lens of business model literature, the extant contributions on Circular Economy, we propose a taxonomy of Circular Economy Business Models based on the degree of adoption of circularity along two major dimensions: (i) the customer value proposition & interface, i.e. the implementation of the circularity concept in proposing value to customers: (ii) the value network, i.e. the ways through which interacting with suppliers and reorganizing the own internal activities. The taxonomy is then initially tested through some explorative case studies, showing in practice the ability of the framework to properly distinguish different modes of adoption of Circular Economy.

Variants of such business models have been suggested for decades, and there are notable success stories such as the Xerox product-service offering based on photocopiers that are remanufactured. Still, we are not seeing widespread adoption in industry. This paper examines causes for reluctance. Drawing on a hypothesis-testing framework of business model innovation, we show that circular business models imply significant challenges to proactive uncertainty reduction for the entrepreneur. Moreover, we show that many product-service system variants that facilitate return flow control in circular business models further aggravate the potential negative effects of failed uncertainty reduction because of increased capital commitments. Through a longitudinal action research study we also provide a counterexample to many of the challenges identified in previous studies, which could be overcome in the studied case.

However, the state of the art shows that a deep research on CE assessment and indicators is still lacking, in particular on the micro level. This work tries to fill this gap, first analyzing the current literature on CE assessment, then proposing a reference framework for the monitoring phase of a CE strategy. Finally, the main existing environmental assessment methodologies based on indexes are analyzed according to their suitability to evaluate the circularity of a system. A systematic approach for the choice of the adequate methodology is also provided, highlighting the main critical steps in the assessment of a CE strategy.

A variety of business model innovation approaches have been proposed to suit circular economy or sustainability principles. Although they largely have been addressed independently as two separate knowledge areas, there is an opportunity to seize synergies from the intersection of both streams. This paper provides a review of approaches for business model innovation for circular economy and/or sustainability, based on a systematic review of academic literature and practitioner-based methodologies. The systematic literature review identified 94 publications and 92 approaches (including conceptual models, methods or tools). The different approaches were categorized according to the business model innovation process, following a three stage dynamic capability view. Subsequently they were compared based on five characteristics (nature of data, boundaries of analysis, level of abstraction, time-based view, and representation style), to allow for a better understanding of how to use the approaches in research and practice. Based on the review, key findings outlining trends and a reflection about the interface of the scopes of circular economy-oriented and sustainability-oriented business model innovation are presented. Moreover, a number of gaps are identified and a framework that maps a future research agenda to simultaneously advance both streams is outlined. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This model, formally accepted in 2002 and termed the 'circular economy', is understood to mean the realisation of a closed loop of material flows in the Chinese economic system. Successful implementation of this model is seen as one way in which China can 'leapfrog' past environmental damage that is typically seen as economies industrialise. This paper introduces the development of the model in China, and presents the current situation of circular economy practice in China. The paper describes current measures being implemented in China for the long-term promotion of a circular economy, including the formulation of objectives, legislation, policies and measures, so that the country can 'leapfrog' its way from environmentally damaging development to a more sustainable path. The paper then identifies a series of barriers and challenges to the implementation of the concept in China. Finally, conclusions on the future of the circular economy concept are drawn. Data were derived primarily from an analysis of secondary sources (i.e. previously published papers). Additional primary data derived from the main author's personal involvement in several circular economy initiatives were also employed.","[Geng, Yong] Dalian Univ Technol, Inst Ecoplanning & Dev, Sch Management Bldg, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Doberstein, Brent] Univ Waterloo, Dept Geog, Fac Environm Studies, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",Dalian University of Technology; University of Waterloo,"Geng, Y (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",ecoplan@dlut.edu.cn,"Geng, Yong/B-6310-2018","Geng, Yong/0000-0002-2284-1375",,,,,34,437,468,7,286,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1350-4509,1745-2627,,INT J SUST DEV WORLD,Int.

Several frameworks found in the academic and practitioner literature propose circular economy business models (CEBMs) to redefine how companies create value while adhering to CE principles. A review of these frameworks shows that some models are frequently discussed, some are framework specific, and some use a different wording to refer to similar CEBMs, pointing to the need to consolidate the current state of the art. We conduct a morphological analysis of 26 current CEBMs from the literature, which includes defining their major business model dimensions and identifying the specific characteristics of these dimensions. Based on this analysis, we identify a broad range of business model design options and propose six major CEBM patterns with the potential to support the closing of resource flows: repair and maintenance; reuse and redistribution; refurbishment and remanufacturing; recycling; cascading and repurposing; and organic feedstock business model patterns. We also discuss different design strategies to support the development of these CEBMs.","[Luedeke-Freund, Florian] ESCP Europe Business Sch, Chair Corp Sustainabil, Heubnerweg 8-10, D-14059 Berlin, Germany; [Gold, Stefan] Univ Kassel, Fac Econ & Management, Kassel, Germany; [Bocken, Nancy M.

Design/methodology/approach The qualitative research method was deployed in three stages. Stage 1 was a literature review of concepts, successful factors and barriers related to the transition towards a CE along with sustainable supply chain management, smart production systems and additive manufacturing (AM). Stage 2 comprised a conceptual framework to integrate and evaluate the synergistic potential among these concepts. Finally, stage 3 validated the proposed model by collecting rich qualitative data based on semi-structured interviews with managers, researchers and professors of operations management to gather insightful and relevant information. Findings The outcome of the study is the recommendation of a circular model to reuse scrap electronic devices, integrating web technologies, reverse logistics and AM to support CE practices. Results suggest a positive influence from improving business sustainability by reinserting waste into the supply chain to manufacture products on demand. Social implications The purpose of this study was to explore how Industry 4.0 technologies are integrated with CE practices. This allows for the proposal of a circular business model for recycling waste and delivering new products, significantly reducing resource consumption and optimising natural resources. In a first stage, the circular business model can be used to recycle electronic scrap, with the proposed integration of web technologies, reverse logistics and AM as a technological platform to support the model. These have several environmental, sociotechnical and economic implications for society. Originality/value The sociotechnical aspects are directly impacted by the circular smart production system (CSPS) management model, since it creates a new culture of reuse and recycling techniques for urban waste using 3D printing technologies, as well as Industry 4.0 concepts to increase production on demand and automate manufacturing processes. The tendency of the CSPS model is to contribute to deployment CE in the manufacture of new products or parts with AM approaches, generating a new path of supply and demand for society.","[Mattos Nascimento, Daniel Luiz; Goncalves Quelhas, Osvaldo Luiz; Gusmao Caiado, Rodrigo Goyannes] Fed Fluminense Univ, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil; [Alencastro, Viviam] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio De Janeiro, Dept Mech Engn, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo] Univ Derby, Ctr Supply Chain Improvement, Derby, England; [Lona, Luis Rocha] CINVESTAV, Natl Polytech Inst, Ctr Res & Adv Studies, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Tortorella, Guilherme] Univ Fed Santa Catarina, Prod & Syst Engn, Florianopolis, SC, Brazil",Universidade Federal Fluminense; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro; University of Derby; Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; CINVESTAV - Centro de Investigacion y de Estudios Avanzados del Instituto Politecnico Nacional; Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (UFSC),"Nascimento, DLM (corresponding author), Fed Fluminense Univ, Niteroi, RJ, Brazil.",danielmn@puc-rio.br,"Nascimento, Daniel Luiz de Mattos/AAX-8461-2021; Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo/ABD-5164-2021; Caiado, Rodrigo/S-9342-2019; jam, amir/O-6460-2019; QUELHAS, OSVALDO OLGQ/I-8171-2017; Nascimento, Daniel Luiz Mattos/ABE-6193-2020; Rocha-Lona, Luis/O-6915-2019; Reyes, José Antonio Reyes/GXZ-6957-2022","Nascimento, Daniel Luiz de Mattos/0000-0002-4977-8652; Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo/0000-0002-5493-877X; Caiado, Rodrigo/0000-0002-3290-8385; Rocha-Lona, Luis/0000-0002-7865-3752; Tortorella, Guilherme/0000-0003-2396-4665",,,,,78,431,442,71,894,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-038X,1758-7786,,J MANUF TECHNOL MANA,J.

New tools are required to support practitioners, decision makers and policy-makers towards more CE practices, as well as to monitor the effects of CE adoption. Worldwide, academics, industrialists and politicians all agree on the need to use CE-related measuring instruments to manage this transition at different systemic levels. In this context, a wide range of circularity indicators (C-indicators) has been developed in recent years. Yet, as there is not one single definition of the CE concept, it is of the utmost importance to know what the available indicators measure in order to use them properly. Indeed, through a systematic literature review considering both academic and grey literature 55 sets of C-indicators, developed by scholars, consulting companies and governmental agencies, have been identified, encompassing different purposes, scopes, and potential usages. Inspired by existing taxonomies of eco-design tools and sustainability indicators, and in line with the CE characteristics, a classification of indicators aiming to assess, improve, monitor and communicate on the CE performance is proposed and discussed. In the developed taxonomy including 10 categories, C-indicators are differentiated regarding criteria such as the levels of CE implementation (e.g. micro, meso, macro), the CE loops (maintain, reuse, remanufacture, recycle), the performance (intrinsic, impacts), the perspective of circularity (actual, potential) they are taking into account, or their degree of transversality (generic, sector-specific). In addition, the database inventorying the 55 sets of C-indicators is linked to an Excel-based query tool to facilitate the selection of appropriate indicators according to the specific user's needs and requirements. This study enriches the literature by giving a first need-driven taxonomy of C-indicators, which is experienced on several use cases. It provides a synthesis and clarification to the emerging and must-needed research theme of C-indicators, and sheds some light on remaining key challenges like their effective uptake by industry. Eventually, limitations, improvement areas, as well as implications of the proposed taxonomy are intently addressed to guide future research on C-indicators and CE implementation.

However, current CE research tends to focus either on the macro-scale, such a seco-parks, or the micro-scale, such as manufactured products, with the risk of ignoring the additional impacts and potentials at the meso-scale of individual buildings. This article sets out to unpack the fundamental defining dimensions of a CE and frame them for CE studies for the built environment. A critical literature review forms the basis for identifying and framing such fundamental dimensions. Our contribution highlights the key roles of interdisciplinary research and of both bottom up and top-down initiatives in facilitating the transition to 'circular buildings'. The frame for reference has been used to capture current discourse on the sustainability of the built environment and has proved to be a valuable tool to cluster existing initiatives and highlight missing links for interdisciplinary endeavours. The article represents a contribution to the theoretical foundations of CE research in the built environment and a stepping stone to shape future research initiatives.

The concept of a circular economy, introduced by the late David Pearce in 1990, addresses the interlinkages of the four economic functions of the environment. The environment not only provides amenity values, in addition to being a resource base and a sink for economic activities, it is also a fundamental life-support system. Environmental economists have suggested that, taking these four functions as an analytical starting point, unpriced or underpriced services should be internalised in the economy. In Europe significant advances have been achieved in the pricing of externalities by means of truly interdisciplinary analysis which accounts in detail for the environmental consequences. The monetary estimates reached as a result of such interdisciplinary research are gradually being applied to the economic analysis of environmental policy priorities. Although such figures provide only a partial and incomplete picture of the environmental costs at stake, they support and inform the analysis of the virtues of a circular economy for individual resources as well as for sustainability as a future trajectory.","Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Policy Anal, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Andersen, MS (corresponding author), Natl Environm Res Inst, Dept Policy Anal, Grenaavej 14, DK-8410 Ronde, Denmark.",msa@dmu.dk,"Andersen, Mikael Skou/AAN-1913-2021","Andersen, Mikael Skou/0000-0003-2299-8134",,,,,14,422,480,6,246,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Forty-one studies were reviewed, whereof 85% deal with recycling and 41% with reuse (27% cover both reuse and recycling). Fibre recycling is the most studied recycling type (57%), followed by polymer/oligomer recycling (37%), monomer recycling (29%), and fabric recycling (14%). Cotton (76%) and polyester (63%) are the most studied materials. The reviewed publications provide strong support for claims that textile reuse and recycling in general reduce environmental impact compared to incineration and landfilling, and that reuse is more beneficial than recycling. The studies do, however, expose scenarios under which reuse and recycling are not beneficial for certain environmental impacts. For example, as benefits mainly arise due to the avoided production of new products, benefits may not occur in cases with low replacement rates or if the avoided production processes are relatively clean. Also, for reuse, induced customer transport may cause environmental impact that exceeds the benefits of avoided production, unless the use phase is sufficiently extended. In terms of critical methodological assumptions, authors most often assume that textiles sent to recycling are wastes free of environmental burden, and that reused products and products made from recycled materials replace products made from virgin fibres. Examples of other content mapped in the review are: trends of publications over time, common aims and geographical scopes, commonly included and omitted impact categories, available sources of primary inventory data, knowledge gaps and future research needs. The latter include the need to study cascade systems, to explore the potential of combining various reuse and recycling routes. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, treatment for waste PCBs is a challenge due to the fact that PCBs are diverse and complex in terms of materials and components makeup as well as the original equipment's manufacturing processes. Recycle technology for waste PCBs in China is still immature. Previous studies focused on metals recovery, but resource utilization for nonmetals and further separation of the mixed metals are relatively fewer. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a proper recycle technology for waste PCBs. In this paper, current status of waste PCBs treatment in China was introduced, and several recycle technologies were analyzed. Some advices against the existing problems during recycling process were presented. Based on circular economy concept in China and complete recycling and resource utilization for all materials, a new environmental-friendly integrated recycling process with no pollution and high efficiency for waste PCBs was provided and discussed in detail.

Air pollution causes many health problems, causing social and economic negative effects. Worldwide efforts are being made to avoid global warming consequences through the establishment of international agreements that then lead to local policies adapted to the development of each signing nation. In addition, there is a depletion of nonrenewable resources which may be scarce or nonexistent in future generations. The preservation of resources, which is a common goal of the Circular Economy strategy and of sustainable development, is not being accomplished nowadays. In this work, the calculation of indicators and mathematical and statistical analysis were applied to clarify and evidence the trends, provide information for the decision-making process, and increase public awareness. The fact that European countries do not possess abundant reserves of fossil fuels will not change, but the results of this analysis can evolve in the future. In this work, fossil fuel energy consumption, fossil fuel depletion, and their relationship with other variables, such as energy dependence and share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, were analyzed for 29 European countries. Furthermore, it was possible to conclude that many European countries still depend heavily on fossil fuels. Significant differences were not found in what concerns gross inland consumption per capita when the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied. It was possible to estimate that by 2050 (considering Jazz scenario) it will only remain approximately 14% of oil proven reserves, 72% of coal proven reserves and 18% of gas proven reserves. Given the small reserves of European countries on fossil fuels, if they need to use them, they will fast disappear.","[Martins, Florinda] ISEP, LAQV, REQUIMTE, Sch Engn, P-4249015 Porto, Portugal; [Felgueiras, Carlos; Caetano, Nidia] ISEP, CIETI, Sch Engn, P-4249015 Porto, Portugal; [Smitkova, Miroslava] Slovak Univ Technol Bratislava, FEI, Inst Power & Appl Elect Engn, Ilkovicova 3, Bratislava 81219 1, Slovakia; [Caetano, Nidia] Univ Porto, Fac Engn, LEPABE Lab Proc Engn Environm Biotechnol & Energy, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200465 Porto, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto; Slovak University of Technology Bratislava; Universidade do Porto,"Martins, F (corresponding author), ISEP, LAQV, REQUIMTE, Sch Engn, P-4249015 Porto, Portugal.",ffm@isep.ipp.pt; mcf@isep.ipp.pt; miroslava.smitkova@suba.sk; nsc@isep.ipp.pt,"Felgueiras, Carlos/R-5312-2016; Caetano, Nidia S./I-3934-2012","Felgueiras, Carlos/0000-0002-4202-5551; Caetano, Nidia S./0000-0002-2185-6401; Martins, F./0000-0002-8866-1799","Laboratory for Process Engineering, Environment, Biotechnology and Energy (LEPABE) - national funds through FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC) [UID/EQU/00511/2019]; Center for Innovation in Engineering and Industrial Technology (CIETI) [UID/EQU/00305/2013]; European Union (FEDER funds through COMPETE); National Funds (FCT) [UID/QUI/50006/2013]","Laboratory for Process Engineering, Environment, Biotechnology and Energy (LEPABE) - national funds through FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC); Center for Innovation in Engineering and Industrial Technology (CIETI); European Union (FEDER funds through COMPETE)(European Union (EU)); National Funds (FCT)","This work was financially supported by project UID/EQU/00511/2019-Laboratory for Process Engineering, Environment, Biotechnology and Energy (LEPABE) funded by national funds through FCT/MCTES (PIDDAC), by project UID/EQU/00305/2013-Center for Innovation in Engineering and Industrial Technology (CIETI), and by European Union (FEDER funds through COMPETE) and National Funds (FCT) through project UID/QUI/50006/2013.",,34,404,414,65,266,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1996-1073,,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAR 2,2019,12,6,,,,,,,964,10.3390/en12060964,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12060964,,,11,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Energy & Fuels,HU9LV,,"Green Published, gold",Y,N,2024-04-26,WOS:000465616800003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Current interest in the area of carbon dioxide valorisation aims at new, emerging technologies that are able to provide new opportunities to turn a waste into value. Polymers are among the most widely produced chemicals in the world greatly affecting the quality of life. However, there are growing concerns about the lack of reuse of the majority of the consumer plastics and their after-life disposal resulting in an increasing demand for sustainable alternatives. New monomers and polymers that can address these issues are therefore warranted, and merging polymer synthesis with the recycling of carbon dioxide offers a tangible route to transition towards a circular economy. Here, an overview of the most relevant and recent approaches to CO2-based monomers and polymers are highlighted with particular emphasis on the transformation routes used and their involved manifolds.","[Grignard, Bruno; Gennen, Sandro; Jerome, Christine; Detrembleur, Christophe] Univ Liege, CERM, Dept Chem, Sart Tilman B6A, B-4000 Liege, Belgium; [Kleij, Arjan W.] BIST, Inst Chem Res Catalonia ICIQ, Ave Paisos Catalans 16, Tarragona 43007, Spain; [Kleij, Arjan W.] Catalan Inst Res & Adv Studies ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain",University of Liege; Barcelona Institute of Science & Technology; Universitat Rovira i Virgili; Institute of Chemical Research of Catalonia; ICREA,"Detrembleur, C (corresponding author), Univ Liege, CERM, Dept Chem, Sart Tilman B6A, B-4000 Liege, Belgium.;Kleij, AW (corresponding author), BIST, Inst Chem Res Catalonia ICIQ, Ave Paisos Catalans 16, Tarragona 43007, Spain.;Kleij, AW (corresponding author), Catalan Inst Res & Adv Studies ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain.",akleij@iciq.es; christophe.detrembleur@uliege.be,"; Detrembleur, Christophe/D-7079-2011","Jerome, Christine/0000-0001-8442-5740; Detrembleur, Christophe/0000-0001-7849-6796; Grignard, Bruno/0000-0002-6016-3317","Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique (FNRS) [O019618F, 30902231]; Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek - Vlaanderen (FWO) [O019618F, 30902231]; FNRS [U.

Plastic packaging is diverse and made of multiple polymers and numerous additives, along with other components, such as adhesives or coatings. Further, packaging can contain residues from substances used during manufacturing, such as solvents, along with non-intentionally added substances (NIAS), such as impurities, oligomers, or degradation products. To characterize risks from chemicals potentially released during manufacturing, use, disposal, and/or recycling of packaging, comprehensive information on all chemicals involved is needed. Here, we present a database of Chemicals associated with Plastic Packaging (CPPdb), which includes chemicals used during manufacturing and/or present in final packaging articles. The CPPdb lists 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging and 3377 substances that are possibly associated. Of the 906 chemicals likely associated with plastic packaging, 63 rank highest for human health hazards and 68 for environmental hazards according to the harmonized hazard classifications assigned by the European Chemicals Agency within the Classification, Labeling and Packaging (CLP) regulation implementing the United Nations' Globally Harmonized System (GHS). Further, 7 of the 906 substances are classified in the European Union as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT), or very persistent, very bioaccumulative (vPvB), and 15 as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Thirty-four of the 906 chemicals are also recognized as EDC or potential EDC in the recent EDC report by the United Nations Environment Programme. The identified hazardous chemicals are used in plastics as monomers, intermediates, solvents, surfactants, plasticizers, stabilizers, biocides, flame retardants, accelerators, and colorants, among other functions. Ourwork was challenged by a lack of transparency and incompleteness of publicly available information on both the use and toxicity of numerous substances. The most hazardous chemicals identified here should be assessed in detail as potential candidates for substitution. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Its specific impact can be considered rather low, but the large generated volume and embodied resource makes this waste stream an important focus of current European policies. The European Commission has proposed new targets and goals for this waste stream in the Circular Economy package, but, given the rather heterogeneous landscape of waste management practice across Member States, new approaches that take into account the entire value chain of the construction sector are urgently required. This paper synthesises core principles and linked best practices for the management of construction and demolition waste across the entire construction value chain. Systematic implementation of these best practices could dramatically improve resource efficiency and reduce environmental impact by: reducing waste generation, minimising transport impacts, maximising re-use and recycling by improving the quality of secondary materials and optimising the environmental performance of treatment methods.","[Galvez-Martos, Jose-Luis] IMDEA Energy, Syst Anal Unit, Madrid, Spain; [Styles, David] Bangor Univ, Sch Environm Nat Resources & Geog, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Styles, David] NUI Galway, Ryan Inst, Plant & Agribiosci Ctr, Galway, Ireland; [Schoenberger, Harald] Univ Stuttgart, Inst Siedlungswasserbau Wasserguete & Abfallwirts, Stuttgart, Germany; [Zeschmar-Lahl, Barbara] BZL Kommunikat & Projektsteuerung GmbH, Oyten, Germany",IMDEA Energy; Bangor University; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway; University of Stuttgart,"Gálvez-Martos, JL (corresponding author), IMDEA Energy, Syst Anal Unit, Madrid, Spain.",joseluis.galvez@imdea.org,"Martos, Jose Luis Galvez/AAF-4691-2019; Galvez Martos, Jose Luis/J-7494-2017","Styles, David/0000-0003-4185-4478; Galvez Martos, Jose Luis/0000-0001-5277-9667",,,,,60,387,404,43,415,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

With the increased attention of circular economy in the past half-decade with the emphasis of holistically addressing economic, environmental, and social aspects of the industrial-sector, biorefinery acts as a strategic mechanism for the realization of a circular bioeconomy. This study presents a comprehensive review of different biorefinery models used for various biomass feedstocks such as lignocelluloses, algae, and numerous waste-types. The review focuses on how biorefinery is instrumental in the transition of various biomass-based industries in a circular bioeconomy. The results reveal that the social-economic aspect of the industrial sector has a major influence on the full adoption of biorefineries in circular bioeconomy. Biomass wastes have played a major role in the implementation of biorefinery in circular bioeconomy.

The research method is a combination of semantic analysis, bibliometrics, networks and content analysis in a systematic literature review. The sample is composed of 327 articles extracted from the Web of Science and Scopus database. The results point out the lack of consensus on terminologies and definitions, thus, based on semantic analysis, a definition is proposed. In addition, the literature shows two main clusters, with different backgrounds, of different leading research groups in distinctive geographic regions. One cluster focuses on ecoparks and industrial symbiosis, mostly in the context of China. The second cluster is concerned with supply chains, material closed loops and business models.

This paper assembles and evaluates technical and policy interventions, both on the supply side and on the demand side. It identifies measures that, employed together, can achieve net zero industrial emissions in the required timeframe. Key supply-side technologies include energy efficiency (especially at the system level), carbon capture, electrification, and zero-carbon hydrogen as a heat source and chemical feedstock. There are also promising technologies specific to each of the three top-emitting industries: cement, iron & steel, and chemicals & plastics. These include cement admixtures and alternative chemistries, several technological routes for zero-carbon steelmaking, and novel chemical catalysts and separation technologies. Crucial demand-side approaches include material-efficient design, reductions in material waste, substituting low-carbon for high-carbon materials, and circular economy interventions (such as improving product longevity, reusability, ease of refurbishment, and recyclability). Strategic, well-designed policy can accelerate innovation and provide incentives for technology deployment. High-value policies include carbon pricing with border adjustments or other price signals; robust government support for research, development, and deployment; and energy efficiency or emissions standards. These core policies should be supported by labeling and government procurement of low-carbon products, data collection and disclosure requirements, and recycling incentives. In implementing these policies, care must be taken to ensure a just transition for displaced workers and affected communities. Similarly, decarbonization must complement the human and economic development of low- and middle-income countries.","[Rissman, Jeffrey] Energy Innovat LLC, 98 Battery St Ste 202, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA; [Bataille, Chris] IDDRI, 27 Rue St Guillaume, F-75337 Paris 07, France; [Bataille, Chris] Simon Fraser Univ, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Masanet, Eric] Northwestern Univ, 2145 Sheridan Rd, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Aden, Nate] World Resources Inst, 10 G St NE,Ste 800, Washington, DC 20002 USA; [Morrow, William R., III; Zhou, Nan; du Can, Stephane de la Rue; Lu, Hongyou] Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Elliott, Neal] Amer Council Energy Efficient Econ, 529 14th St NW,Suite 600, Washington, DC 20045 USA; [Dell, Rebecca] ClimateWorks Fdn, 235 Montgomery St Ste 1300, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA; [Heeren, Niko] Yale Univ, Ctr Ind Ecol, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Huckestein, Brigitta] BASF, Carl Bosch Str 38, D-67063 Ludwigshafen, Germany; [Cresko, Joe] US DOE Adv Mfg Off, 1000 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20585 USA; [Miller, Sabbie A.] Univ Calif Davis, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Roy, Joyashree] Asian Inst Technol, 58 Moo 9,Km 42,Paholyothin Highway, Khlong Luang 12120, Pathum Thani, Thailand; [Fennell, Paul] Imperial Coll London, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Cremmins, Betty] CDP North Amer Inc, 127 West 26th St,Suite 300, New York, NY 10001 USA; [Blank, Thomas Koch] Rocky Mt Inst, 22830 Two Rivers Rd, Basalt, CO 81621 USA; [Hone, David] Shell Int Ltd, Shell Ctr, York Rd, London SE1 2NB, England; [Williams, Ellen D.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Sisson, Bill] WBCSD North Amer, 300 Pk Ave,12th Floor, New York, NY 10022 USA; [Williams, Mike] BlueGreen Alliance, 2701 Univ Ave SE,209, Minneapolis, MN 55414 USA; [Katzenberger, John] Aspen Global Change Inst, 104 Midland Ave 205, Basalt, CO 81621 USA; [Burtraw, Dallas] Resources Future Inc, 1616 P St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Sethi, Girish] Energy & Resources Inst, Darbari Seth Block,IHC Complex,Lodhi Rd, New Delhi 110003, India; [Ping, He] Energy Fdn China, CITIC Bldg,Room 2403,19 Jianguomenwai Dajie, Beijing 100004, Peoples R China; [Danielson, David] Breakthrough Energy Ventures, 2730 Sand Hill Rd,Suite 220, Menlo Pk, CA 94025 USA; [Lorber, Tom] Childrens Investment Fund Fdn, 7 Clifford St, London W1S 2FT, England; [Dinkel, Jens] PricewaterhouseCoopers, Bernhard Wicki Str 8, D-80636 Munich, Germany; [Helseth, Jonas] Bellona Fdn, Vulkan 11, N-0178 Oslo, Norway",Simon Fraser University; Northwestern University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Yale University; BASF; University of California System; University of California Davis; Asian Institute of Technology; Imperial College London; Royal Dutch Shell; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; Resources for the Future; TERI University,"Rissman, J (corresponding author), Energy Innovat LLC, 98 Battery St Ste 202, San Francisco, CA 94111 USA.",jeff@energyinnovation.org; chris.bataille@iddri.org; eric.masanet@northwestern.edu; naden@wri.org; wrmorrow@lbl.gov; NZhou@lbl.gov; rnelliott@aceee.org; dell@rebeccadell.net; nheeren@buildenvironment.com; brigitta.huckestein@basf.com; Joe.Cresko@ee.doe.gov; sabmil@ucdavis.edu; joyashree@ait.ac.th; p.fennell@imperial.ac.uk; Betty.Cremmins@cdp.net; tkochblank@rmi.org; david.hone@shell.com; edw@umd.edu; sadelarueducan@lbl.gov; mwilliams@bluegreenalliance.org; johnk@agci.org; burtraw@rff.org; girishs@teri.res.in; heping@efchina.org; david@b-t.energy; hylu@lbl.gov; TLorber@ciff.org; jens.dinkel@pwc.com; jonas@bellona.org,"de la Rue du Can, Stephane/ABI-1794-2020; Williams, Ellen D D/ABC-9244-2021; Miller, Sabbie/AAI-9687-2021; fennell, paul s/G-4772-2013; Lu, Hongyou/HGT-8518-2022; Heeren, Niko/N-3390-2017","de la Rue du Can, Stephane/0000-0001-8054-5737; Rissman, Jeffrey/0000-0001-7826-3247; Heeren, Niko/0000-0003-4967-6557; Miller, Sabbie/0000-0001-6888-7312",William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,This work stems from a November 2018 meeting convened by the Aspen Global Change Institute with support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.,,324,370,387,78,697,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-2619,1872-9118,,APPL ENERG,Appl.

In the shift towards the CE, quantifying the circularity of products and services (or their contribution to the CE) is crucial in designing policies and business strategies, and prioritizing sustainable solutions based on evidence. New circularity metrics are being developed for that purpose, but they often present contradiction in both form and content, which contributes to confusion and misunderstanding of the CE concept. This review aims to map methodological developments regarding circularity metrics for products and services, in order to: (1) identify the foundations of circularity metrics used so far and their applications, (2) evaluate the validity of current circularity metrics, based on predefined requirements and a CE definition anchored in the sustainability concept, and (3) provide recommendations on how to measure circularity. The literature search provided a wide variety of CE metrics being developed and applied (seven measurement indices, nine assessment indicators and three assessment frameworks). However, none of them are addressing the CE concept in full, potentially leading to undesirable burden shifting from reduced material consumption to increased environmental, economic or social impacts. Additionally, new metrics under-represent the complexities of multiple cycles and the consequences of material downcycling. Circularity metrics intended to sustainable decision making should be comprehensive enough to avoid burden shifting, and clearly indicate how the benefits of recycling are allocated between the primary and secondary products.","[Corona, Blanca; Shen, Li; Reike, Denise; Carreon, Jesus Rosales; Worrell, Ernst] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Vening Meinesz Bldg A,Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Corona, B (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Vening Meinesz Bldg A,Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",b.c.coronabellostas@uu.nl,"Corona, Blanca/GLS-0753-2022; Worrell, Ernst/L-5455-2013; Corona Bellostas, Blanca/L-7585-2014; Shen, Li/N-3127-2013","Worrell, Ernst/0000-0002-0199-9755; Corona Bellostas, Blanca/0000-0003-1257-3319; Shen, Li/0000-0001-9378-7372",,,,,101,364,374,36,223,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Chinese and European perspectives on a CE share a common conceptual basis and exhibit many similar concerns in seeking to enhance resource efficiency. Yet they also differ, and this article explores differences in the focus of CE policy in China and Europe. We present evidence on the differing understandings of the CE concept in Chinese and European policy discourse, drawing on qualitative and quantitative analysis of policy documents, media articles, and academic publications. We show that the Chinese perspective on the CE is broad, incorporating pollution and other issues alongside waste and resource concerns, and it is framed as a response to the environmental challenges created by rapid growth and industrialization. In contrast, Europe's conception of the CE has a narrower environmental scope, focusing more narrowly on waste and resources and opportunities for business. We then examine similarities and differences in the focus of policy activity in the two regions and in the indicators used to measure progress. We show differences in the treatment of issues of scale and place and different priorities across value chains (from design to manufacture, consumption, and waste management). We suggest some reasons for the divergent policy articulation of the CE concept and suggest lessons that each region can learn from the other.","[McDowall, Will; Bleischwitz, Raimund; Domenech, Teresa] UCL, Inst Sustainable Resources, London, England; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Huang, Beijia] Univ Shanghai Sci & Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Bartekova, Eva] Ellen MacArthur Fdn, Cowes, England; [Bartekova, Eva; Turkeli, Serdar; Kemp, Rene] Maastricht Univ UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands",University of London; University College London; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; University of Shanghai for Science & Technology; Maastricht University,"McDowall, W (corresponding author), UCL Inst Sustainable Resources, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",w.mcdowall@ucl.ac.uk,"Turkeli, Serdar/KFQ-7110-2024; Geng, Yong/B-6310-2018; McDowall, Will/A-1106-2009; Bleischwitz, Raimund/JJF-2415-2023; Aparisi, Teresa Domenech/AAA-6137-2020","Geng, Yong/0000-0002-2284-1375; McDowall, Will/0000-0002-4238-0692; Bleischwitz, Raimund/0000-0001-8164-733X; Aparisi, Teresa Domenech/0000-0002-6131-5538; Turkeli, Serdar/0000-0002-6016-3376; huang, beijia/0000-0002-8325-7447","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71461137008, 71325006, 71403170, 71690241]; UK Economic and Social Science Research Council [ES/L015838/1]; Netherlands, through collaborative Sino-European Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency (SINCERE) [467-14-154]; ESRC [ES/L015838/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L015838/1] Funding Source: researchfish","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); UK Economic and Social Science Research Council; Netherlands, through collaborative Sino-European Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency (SINCERE); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This study is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71461137008, 71325006, 71403170, and 71690241); the UK Economic and Social Science Research Council (ES/L015838/1); and the Netherlands (467-14-154), through the collaborative Sino-European Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency (SINCERE) project.",,55,364,375,22,278,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

However, the idea is more often celebrated than critically interrogated. Analysis shows the concept circulates as an idea and ideal, exemplified by industrial symbiosis and extended product life. Yet, its actual enactment is limited and fragile. Instead, circular economies are achieved mostly through global recycling networks which are the primary means by which wastes are recovered as resources. European policies eschew these circuits. Resource recovery through global recycling networks is regarded as a dirty and illegal trade. In its place, EU circular economies attempt to transform wastes into resources within the boundaries of the EU. Through an analysis of two case studies of resource recovery in the United Kingdom, we highlight the challenges that confront making circular economies within the EU, showing that these are borne of a conjuncture of politically created markets, material properties and morally defined materials circuits. We show resource recovery in the EU to be framed by moral economies, driven by discourses of ecological modernization, environmental justice and resource (in)security, the last of which connects to China's resource-intensive development.","[Gregson, Nicky; Crang, Mike] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Fuller, Sara] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Holmes, Helen] Univ Sheffield, Dept Phys & Astron, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",Durham University; Macquarie University; University of Sheffield,"Gregson, N (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",nicky.gregson@durham.ac.uk; m.a.crang@durham.ac.u; sara.fuller@mq.edu.au; h.holmes@sheffield.ac.uk,"Crang, Mike/C-8178-2011; Fuller, Sara/A-4640-2014; Gregson, Nicky/E-2167-2014","Crang, Mike/0000-0001-7678-8496; Fuller, Sara/0000-0002-9830-1615; Holmes, Helen/0000-0002-4918-2007; Gregson, Nicky/0000-0002-2796-389X",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES 000-23-0007]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Council (EPSRC) 'Bridging the Gap' [EP/J501323/1]; ESRC [ES/E002196/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E002196/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/J501323/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Council (EPSRC) 'Bridging the Gap'(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),Research for this paper was supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [grant number RES 000-23-0007] (The Waste of the World) and by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Council (EPSRC) 'Bridging the Gap' [grant number EP/J501323/1].,,100,364,376,9,334,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

In general, the literature on sustainability has focused mainly on the environmental issues, whereas, more recently, a Circular Economy has been proposed as one of the latest concepts for addressing both the environmental and socio-economic issues. A Circular Economy aims at transforming waste into resources and on bridging production and consumption activities; however, there is still limited research focusing on these aspects. This paper addresses the link between procurement and supply practices, and proposes changing from a traditional public procurement process, based on product-selling business models, to a more service oriented system. The paper proposes a framework to include technical and non-technical specifications of product/service combinations that improve resource usage efficiency through recovery. The framework also considers socio-cultural specifications and physical and social proximity between the stakeholders in the procurement process. The frameworkis based on collaboration, which is a vital link between the public procurement process and the development of more sustainable business models, where the experience gained in the collaboration process serves as the bases for suppliers and procurers in improving their contribution to CE, whilst at the same time securing economic benefits for both parties. Although, in this process, the specification setting may take longer, the relationships between procurer and supplier tend to be longer lasting and stronger. This research shows that collaboration between procurers and suppliers throughout the procurement process can lead to reductions in raw material utilisation and waste generation, whilst promoting the development of new, more sustainable, business models.

However, green economy covers a lot of diverse concepts and its links with sustainability are not always clear. In this article, we focus on definitions of green economy and related concepts and an evaluation of these concepts against the criterion of strong and weak sustainability. The article serves three purposes: Firstly, we identify and describe diverse theories, concepts, approaches and tools related to a green economy. Among these are the theories of environmental economics and ecological economics, the concepts and approaches of cleaner production, waste hierarchy, bio-economy, industrial ecology, circular economy, nature-based solutions, and dematerialization through product-servicizing, and tools like life cycle assessment, and cost-benefit analysis. Secondly, we develop a framework that shows the capacity of the green economy concepts, approaches and tools to support the transition towards sustainability. Such a framework can serve as a heuristic to embed diverse concepts and approaches into a green economy framework. Thirdly, we briefly discuss green economy concepts with respect to their impact on strong and weak sustainability. Depending on the different concepts, approaches and tools identified in the green economy framework, different degrees of substitutability and trade-offs between environmental and economic benefits are allowed, and more or less structural changes of our modes of living are required.

Several essential state-of-the-art WTE technologies including combustion, gasification and anaerobic digestion were evaluated. Portfolio options of technologies for different types of WTE supply chains were illustrated for achieving circular economy system. Since policy makers have to address the public concerns prior to promulgate and implement relating regulations, the strategies on implementation of WTE supply chain were proposed to overcome the challenging barriers from the aspects of technology, finance, institution and regulation. A total of eight key task-forces were also proposed for effectively executing the strategies. Furthermore, several successful lessons on WTE supply chains such as green fuel pellet for heating supply and co-digestion of organic wastes for bio-gas production around the world were reviewed and illustrated.

Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the food-energy-water nexus. The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions. This review explores multiple components of the food-energy-water nexus and highlights possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear tensions inherent in meeting the growing and changing demand for food and energy in the 21st century, the inherent linkages among food, water, and energy systems can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food, water, and energy security, such as the circular economy.","[D'Odorico, Paolo; Rosa, Lorenzo] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Davis, Kyle Frankel] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY USA; [Carr, Joel A.] US Geol Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Res Ctr, Beltsville, MD USA; [Chiarelli, Davide; Rulli, Maria Cristina] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Milan, Italy; [Dell'Angelo, Jampel] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Policy Anal, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Gephart, Jessica] Natl Socioenvironm Synth Ctr, Annapolis, MD USA; [MacDonald, Graham K.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Seekell, David A.] Umea Univ, Dept Ecol & Environm Sci, Umea, Sweden; [Suweis, Samir] Univ Padua, Dept Phys G Galilei, Padua, Italy",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Columbia University; United States Department of the Interior; United States Geological Survey; Polytechnic University of Milan; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; McGill University; Umea University; University of Padua,"D'Odorico, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Environm Sci Policy & Management, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",paolododo@berkeley.edu,"D'Odorico, Paolo/HTQ-6744-2023; Dell'Angelo, Jampel/AFQ-5722-2022; MacDonald, Graham/L-5648-2019; Rosa, Lorenzo/ABD-7884-2020; Davis, Kyle/AEI-8432-2022; Fuentes, José/JZT-9323-2024; Gephart, Jessica/HCH-3165-2022; Suweis, Samir/G-7001-2014","D'Odorico, Paolo/0000-0002-0007-5833; MacDonald, Graham/0000-0002-7120-1366; Davis, Kyle/0000-0003-4504-1407; Suweis, Samir/0000-0002-1603-8375; Rosa, Lorenzo/0000-0002-1280-9945; Chiarelli, Davide Danilo/0000-0002-4707-3018; Rulli, Maria Cristina/0000-0002-9694-4262; Carr, Joel/0000-0002-9164-4156; Dell'Angelo, Jampel/0000-0003-1431-5364",Ermenegildo Zegna Founder's Scholarship,Ermenegildo Zegna Founder's Scholarship,All the data reviewed in this manuscript are taken from the original studies and publicly available data sets cited in the main text and figure captions.

In recent years, certain evidence indicate that antibiotics and resistance genes may become disseminated in agricultural soils as a result of the amendment with manure and biosolids and irrigation with RWW. Antibiotic residues and other contaminants may undergo sorption/desorption and transformation processes (both biotic and abiotic), and have the potential to affect the soil micro biota. Antibiotics found in the soil pore water (bioavailable fraction) as a result of RWW irrigation may be taken up by crop plants, bioaccumulate within plant tissues and subsequently enter the food webs; potentially resulting in detrimental public health implications. It can be also hypothesized that ARGs can spread among soil and plant-associated bacteria, a fact that may have serious human health implications. The majority of studies dealing with these environmental and social challenges related with the use of RWW for irrigation were conducted under laboratory or using, somehow, controlled conditions. This critical review discusses the state of the art on the fate of antibiotics, ARB and ARGs in agricultural environment where RWW is applied for irrigation. The implications associated with the uptake of antibiotics by plants (uptake mechanisms) and the potential risks to public health are highlighted. Additionally, knowledge gaps as well as challenges and opportunities are addressed, with the aim of boosting future research towards an enhanced understanding of the fate and implications of these contaminants of emerging concern in the agricultural environment. These are key issues in a world where the increasing water scarcity and the continuous appeal of circular economy demand answers for a long-term safe use of RWW for irrigation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Building, maintaining, and in particular operating in-use stocks of materials require raw materials and energy. Material stocks create long-term pathdependencies because of their longevity. Fostering a transition toward environmentally sustainable patterns of resource use requires a more complete understanding of stock-flow relations. Here we show that about half of all materials extracted globally by humans each year are used to build up or renew in-use stocks of materials. Based on a dynamic stock-flow model, we analyze stocks, inflows, and outflows of all materials and their relation to economic growth, energy use, and CO2 emissions from 1900 to 2010. Over this period, global material stocks increased 23-fold, reaching 792 Pg (+/- 5%) in 2010. Despite efforts to improve recycling rates, continuous stock growth precludes closing material loops; recycling still only contributes 12% of inflows to stocks. Stocks are likely to continue to grow, driven by large infrastructure and building requirements in emerging economies. A convergence of material stocks at the level of industrial countries would lead to a fourfold increase in global stocks, and CO2 emissions exceeding climate change goals. Reducing expected future increases of material and energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions will require decoupling of services from the stocks and flows of materials through, for example, more intensive utilization of existing stocks, longer service lifetimes, and more efficient design.","[Krausmann, Fridolin; Wiedenhofer, Dominik; Lauk, Christian; Haas, Willi; Haberl, Helmut] Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, A-1070 Vienna, Austria; [Tanikawa, Hiroki; Fishman, Tomer; Miatto, Alessio] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Environm Studies, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Fishman, Tomer] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Ctr Ind Ecol, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Schandl, Heinz] Commonwealth Sci & Ind Res Org, Black Mt Labs, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",University of Klagenfurt; Nagoya University; Yale University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO),"Krausmann, F (corresponding author), Alpen Adria Univ, Inst Social Ecol Vienna, A-1070 Vienna, Austria.",fridolin.krausmann@aau.at,"Miatto, Alessio/R-9972-2019; Wiedenhofer, Dominik/AAA-5678-2020; Haas, Willi/M-4120-2018; Tanikawa, Hiroki/G-8033-2012; Schandl, Heinz/C-5055-2008; Haberl, Helmut/G-3679-2013; Krausmann, Fridolin/N-1918-2015; Lauk, Christian/S-3969-2019; Fishman, Tomer/C-9772-2015","Miatto, Alessio/0000-0001-7541-9330; Wiedenhofer, Dominik/0000-0001-7418-3477; Haas, Willi/0000-0001-5599-9227; Schandl, Heinz/0000-0001-6399-4231; Haberl, Helmut/0000-0003-2104-5446; Krausmann, Fridolin/0000-0002-9995-2372; Lauk, Christian/0000-0002-4173-1753; Fishman, Tomer/0000-0003-4405-2382","Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [MISO P27590]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan [1-1402]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P27590] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26281056] Funding Source: KAKEN","Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Ministry of the Environment, Japan(Ministry of the Environment, Japan); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Karin Hosking at Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization for editing the manuscript.

To reduce oil consumption and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon dioxide can be captured from stacks or air and utilized as alternative carbon source for chemicals. Here, we show that carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has the technical potential to decouple chemical production from fossil resources, reducing annual GHG emissions by up to 3.5 Gt CO2-eq in 2030. Exploiting this potential, however, requires more than 18.1 PWh of low-carbon electricity, corresponding to 55% of the projected global electricity production in 2030. Most large-scale CCU technologies are found to be less efficient in reducing GHG emissions per unit low-carbon electricity when benchmarked to power-to-X efficiencies reported for other large-scale applications including electro-mobility (e-mobility) and heat pumps. Once and where these other demands are satisfied, CCU in the chemical industry could efficiently contribute to climate change mitigation.","[Kaetelhoen, Arne; Meys, Raoul; Deutz, Sarah; Bardow, Andre] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Suh, Sangwon] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93117 USA; [Bardow, Andre] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, D-52425 Julich, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich,"Bardow, A (corresponding author), Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, D-52062 Aachen, Germany.;Bardow, A (corresponding author), Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, D-52425 Julich, Germany.",andre.bardow@ltt.rwth-aachen.de,"Deutz, Sarah/KFP-9809-2024; Suh, Sangwon/E-2019-2011; Bardow, Andre/C-5446-2009","Suh, Sangwon/0000-0001-8290-6276; Meys, Raoul/0000-0002-0336-9714; Deutz, Sarah/0000-0002-8062-7684; Bardow, Andre/0000-0002-3831-0691",Climate Knowledge and Innovation Community by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology; German Academic Exchange Service through its thematic network ACalNet - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through Science to Achieve Results Program [83557907],Climate Knowledge and Innovation Community by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology; German Academic Exchange Service through its thematic network ACalNet - German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) through Science to Achieve Results Program,"We thank Patrick Eichstadt, Valentin Dinges, and Lucia Baltz for the technical support.

Circular Supply Chain Management (CSCM), which integrates the philosophy of the circular economy into supply chain management, offers a new and compelling perspective to the supply chain sustainability domain. Consequently, there is increasing research interest. However, a review of the extant literature shows that a comprehensive integrated view of CSCM is still absent in the extant literature. This prohibits a clear distinction compared to other supply chain sustainability concepts and hinders further progress of the field. In response, this research first classifies various terminologies related to supply chain sustainability and conceptualizes a unifying definition of CSCM. Using this definition as a base, it then conducts a structured literature review of 261 research articles on the current state of CSCM research. Based on the review results, the researchers call for further studies in the following directions that are important but received little or no attention: design for circularity, procurement and CSCM, biodegradable packaging, circular supply chain collaboration and coordination, drivers and barriers of CSCM, circular consumption, product liabilities and producer's responsibility, and technologies and CSCM.

J,"Kristensen, HS; Mosgaard, MA",,,,"Kristensen, Heidi Simone; Mosgaard, Mette Alberg",,,A review of micro level indicators for a circular economy - moving away from the three dimensions of sustainability?,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,English,Review,,,,,,Circular economy; Indicator; Micro level; Sustainability; Literature review,RESOURCE EFFICIENCY; WASTE MANAGEMENT; DECISION-MAKING; PRODUCT DESIGN; EUROPEAN-UNION; CHINA; PERFORMANCE; TOOL; PRINCIPLES; STRATEGIES,"The circular economy is receiving increasing attention as having the potential to break with the current linear economy of unsustainable production and consumption. A circular economy promotes system innovations that aim to design out waste, increase resource-efficiency, and achieve a better balance between economy, environment and society. Ensuring a successful transition to a circular economy requires the ability to measure and report on progress. Currently, there are three levels of indicators for measuring circular economy: macro (global, national, regional, city), meso (industrial symbiosis, eco-industrial parks), and micro (single firm, product). A detailed understanding of how to measure and document progress towards a circular economy is lacking, especially on a micro level. This is a barrier for both producers who want to provide circular products and services, and for the consumers who want to know how to compare products. This paper helps to open the black box, not by developing a method for measurement, but by categorizing and assessing what is already being done. This paper reviews 30 indicators of a circular economy at the micro level, where the majority of indicators focused on recycling, end-of-life management or remanufacturing, while fewer indicators consider disassembly, lifetime extension, waste management, resource-efficiency or reuse, and the majority of the papers are published in the last few years. There is no commonly accepted way of measuring circular economy in general at the micro level, nor within the different circular economy principles of recycling, remanufacturing etc. As circular economy often is presented as a means to a sustainable development, the alignment between the three dimensions of sustainability and the reviewed indicators is analyzed, which showed that the majority of indicators focus on economic aspects, with environmental and especially social aspects included to a lesser extent. This biased approach to circular economy that favors economic aspects over environmental and social impacts can lead to sub-optimizations when companies apply circular economy and may lead to a narrower approach to sustainability than what has previously been the case. For future research it can be interesting to explore if the same bias exists on meso and macro level, but also to analyze how a more coherent approach can be standardized on micro level.

Biotechnological processes offer an economic and versatile way to concentrate and transform resources from waste/wastewater into valuable products, which is a prerequisite for the technological development of a cradle-to-cradle bio-based economy. This review identifies emerging technologies that enable resource recovery across the wastewater treatment cycle. As such, bioenergy in the form of biohydrogen (by photo and dark fermentation processes) and biogas (during anaerobic digestion processes) have been classic targets, whereby, direct transformation of lipidic biomass into biodiesel also gained attention. This concept is similar to previous biofuel concepts, but more sustainable, as third generation biofuels and other resources can be produced from waste biomass. The production of high value biopolymers (e.g., for bioplastics manufacturing) from organic acids, hydrogen, and methane is another option for carbon recovery. The recovery of carbon and nutrients can be achieved by organic fertilizer production, or single cell protein generation (depending on the source) which may be utilized as feed, feed additives, next generation fertilizers, or even as probiotics. Additionlly, chemical oxidation-reduction and bioelectrochemical systems can recover inorganics or synthesize organic products beyond the natural microbial metabolism. Anticipating the next generation of wastewater treatment plants driven by biological recovery technologies, this review is focused on the generation and re-synthesis of energetic resources and key resources to be recycled as raw materials in a cradle-to-cradle economy concept.","[Puyol, Daniel] King Juan Carlos Univ, Sch Expt Sci & Technol, Grp Chem & Environm Engn, Mostoles, Spain; [Batstone, Damien J.; Hulsen, Tim; Astals, Sergi; Kromer, Jens O.] Univ Queensland, Adv Water Management Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Batstone, Damien J.; Hulsen, Tim] CRC Water Sensit Cities, Clayton, Vic, Australia; [Peces, Miriam] Univ Queensland, Sch Civil Engn, Ctr Solid Waste Bioproc, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kromer, Jens O.] Univ Queensland, Ctr Microbial Electrochem Syst, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; University of Queensland; University of Queensland; University of Queensland,"Puyol, D (corresponding author), King Juan Carlos Univ, Sch Expt Sci & Technol, Grp Chem & Environm Engn, Mostoles, Spain.;Batstone, D (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Adv Water Management Ctr, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.;Batstone, D (corresponding author), CRC Water Sensit Cities, Clayton, Vic, Australia.",daniel.puyol@urjc.es; d.batstone@awmc.uq.edu.au,"Astals-Garcia, Sergi/H-2591-2016; Hülsen, Tim/L-4405-2019; Peces, Miriam/M-2700-2019; Krömer, Jens O./C-5958-2009; Puyol, Daniel/H-3527-2014; Batstone, Damien/N-1896-2014","Astals-Garcia, Sergi/0000-0003-4749-0919; Peces, Miriam/0000-0003-2522-7490; Krömer, Jens O./0000-0001-5006-0819; Puyol, Daniel/0000-0002-2152-4095; Batstone, Damien/0000-0002-4294-3942; Hulsen, Tim/0000-0002-4059-3109",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) of Spain through the project WATER4FOOD [CTQ2014-54563-C3-1-R],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) of Spain through the project WATER4FOOD,Cooperative Research Centre for Water Sensitive Cities Project Number: C2.1.

The notion of waste no longer exists in a CE, because products and materials are, in principle, reused and cycled indefinitely. Taking this description as a starting point, the article asks which guiding principles, design strategies, and methods are required for circular product design and to what extent these differ from the principles, strategies, and methods of eco-design. The article argues that there is a fundamental distinction to be made between eco-design and circular product design and proceeds to develop, based on an extensive literature review, a set of new concepts and definitions, starting from a redefinition of product lifetime and introducing new terms such as presource and recovery horizon. The article then takesWalter Stahel's Inertia Principle as the guiding principle in circular product design and develops a typology of approaches for Design for Product Integrity, with a focus on tangible durable consumer products. The newly developed typology contributes to a deeper understanding of the CE as a concept and informs the discussion on the role of product design in a CE.","[den Hollander, Marcel C.; Bakker, Conny A.; Hultink, Erik Jan] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Ind Design Engn, Landbergstr 15, NL-2628 CE Delft, Netherlands",Delft University of Technology,"den Hollander, MC (corresponding author), Delft Univ Technol, Fac Ind Design Engn, Landbergstr 15, NL-2628 CE Delft, Netherlands.",m.c.denhollander@tudelft.nl,,"Bakker, Conny/0000-0001-9982-8788","European Union's seventh Framework Program for research, technological development, and demonstration [603843]","European Union's seventh Framework Program for research, technological development, and demonstration(European Union (EU)Marie Curie Actions)","This work has been conducted as part of the ResCoM project that has received funding from the European Union's seventh Framework Program for research, technological development, and demonstration under grant agreement no. 603843.",,57,324,341,14,157,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

Drawing on biological, ecological, organizational, and systems theory, a discontinuous three-stage model of industrial symbiosis is presented. The model proceeds from a random formative stage involving numerous actors engaging in material and energy exchanges, to conscious recognition and intentional pursuit of network benefits, to institutionalization of beliefs and norms enabling successful collaborative behavior. While there is much variation, with no single path to this outcome, the recognition of benefits is seen as an emergent property characteristic of these self-organized systems that move beyond the initial stage.","[Chertow, Marian] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Ind Environm Management Program, New Haven, CT 06511 USA",Yale University,"Chertow, M (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Ind Environm Management Program, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",marian.chertow@yale.edu,,"Chertow, Marian/0000-0003-4176-6224",,,,,80,319,334,5,243,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1088-1980,,,J IND ECOL,J.

Although Germany and Japan have made important advances in building recycling incentives into their industrial systems and sought competitive advantage from doing so, China is arguably taking the issue even further (in principle) through its pursuit of a circular economy, now enshrined in law as an official national development goal. In this article, we review a number of the eco-industrial initiatives taken in China and compare them using a common graphical representation with comparable initiatives taken in the West and elsewhere in East Asia. Our aim is to demonstrate some common themes across the case studies, such as the transformation from the former linear economy to a circular economy and the evolutionary processes in which dynamic linkages are gradually established over time. We discuss the drivers of these eco-industrial initiatives as well as the inhibitors, setting the initiatives in an evolutionary framework and introducing a notion of Pareto eco-efficiency to evaluate them. We make the argument that China might be capturing latecomer advantages through its systematic promotion of eco-industrial initiatives within a circular economy framework.","[Mathews, John A.] LUISS Guido Carli Univ, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Tan, Hao] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Management & Ind, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Tan, Hao] Univ Western Sydney, Innovat Studies Res Grp CInIS, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Luiss Guido Carli University; Western Sydney University; Western Sydney University,"Mathews, JA (corresponding author), LUISS Guido Carli Univ, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",jmathews@luiss.it,,"Mathews, John/0000-0002-4380-7563; Tan, Hao/0000-0002-8347-7837",,,,,70,317,334,8,305,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1088-1980,,,J IND ECOL,J.

Starting from these two perspectives, an innovative framework both highlighting the links between I4.0 and CE and unveiling future research fields has been developed. Basing on one of the two perspectives, results show as it is possible to enhance a set of different relations.

It is associated with circular economy system (CE), propagated by the European Union. Circular economy systems keep the added value in products for as long as possible and virtually eliminate waste. Transition to a more circular economy requires changes throughout value chains, from product design to new business and market models, from new ways of turning waste into a resource to new modes of consumer behaviour. These actions relate to all industries, including the construction industry. Nowdays, the increase in demand for construction materials as a result of development has called for an alternative way to develop or derive construction materials from different sources, including sewage sludge ash (SSA). SSA is produced after the firing. process of sewage sludge, and it must be disposed by other means. Researches were already accomplished investigating the use of sewage sludge ash for the building materials manufacturing, such as produce bricks and tiles, as a raw materials for cement production, as aggregates for concrete and mortar, as a component of the synthesis of lightweight materials and as substitute for sand and/or cement in cement stabilized bases, subbases and embankments in road constuctions.

However, polymer materials that are long-lasting and highly durable also tend to have a limited application potential for re-use. This is because such materials derive their durable properties from a high degree of chemical connectivity, resulting in rigid meshes or networks of polymer chains with a high intrinsic resistance to deformation. Once such polymers are fully synthesised, thermal (re)processing becomes hard (or impossible) to achieve without damaging the degree of chemical connectivity, and most recycling options quickly lead to a drop or even loss of material properties. In this context, both academic and industrial researchers have taken a keen interest in materials design that combines high degrees of chemical connectivity with an improved thermal (re)processability, mediated through a dynamic exchange reaction of covalent bonds. In particular vitrimer materials offer a promising concept because they completely maintain their degree of chemical connectivity at all times, yet can show a clear thermally driven plasticity and liquid behavior, enabled through rapid bond rearrangement reactions within the network. In the past decade, many suitable dynamic covalent chemistries were developed to create vitrimer materials, and are now applicable to a wide range of polymer matrices. The material properties of vitrimers, however, do not solely rely on the chemical structure of the polymer matrix, but also on the chemical reactivity of the dynamic bonds. Thus, chemical reactivity considerations become an integral part of material design, which has to take into account for example catalytic and cross-reactivity effects. This mini-review will aim to provide an overview of recent efforts aimed at understanding and controlling dynamic cross-linking reactions within vitrimers, and how directing this chemical reactivity can be used as a handle to steer material properties. Hence, it is shown how a focus on a fundamental chemical understanding can pave the way towards new sustainable materials and applications.","[Guerre, Marc] Univ Paul Sabatier, Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Lab IMRCP,UMR5623, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France; [Taplan, Christian; Du Prez, Filip E.] Univ Ghent, Polymer Chem Res Grp, Ctr Macromol Chem CMaC, Dept Organ & Macromol Chem,Fac Sci, Krijgslaan 281 S4-bis, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Winne, Johan M.] Univ Ghent, Lab Organ Synth, Dept Organ & Macromol Chem, Fac Sci, Krijgslaan 281 S4-bis, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse III - Paul Sabatier; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ghent University; Ghent University,"Guerre, M (corresponding author), Univ Paul Sabatier, Univ Toulouse, CNRS, Lab IMRCP,UMR5623, 118 Route Narbonne, F-31062 Toulouse 9, France.;Du Prez, FE (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Polymer Chem Res Grp, Ctr Macromol Chem CMaC, Dept Organ & Macromol Chem,Fac Sci, Krijgslaan 281 S4-bis, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;Winne, JM (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Lab Organ Synth, Dept Organ & Macromol Chem, Fac Sci, Krijgslaan 281 S4-bis, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",guerre@chimie.ups-tlse.fr; johan.winne@ugent.be; filip.duprez@ugent.be,"MILLAN, Alexis/KBA-7739-2024; Du Prez, Filip E./B-6411-2008; Guerre, Marc/A-7673-2018","Guerre, Marc/0000-0003-1410-9923; Taplan, Christian/0000-0002-8078-0953; Du Prez, Filip/0000-0001-7727-4155",Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO); BOF-UGent (GOA),Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO)(FWO); BOF-UGent (GOA),C.

The waste in developing countries represents a significant source of biomass, recycled materials, chemicals, energy, and revenue if wisely managed and used as a potential feedstock in various biorefinery technologies such as fermentation, anaerobic digestion (AD), pyrolysis, incineration, and gasification. However, the selection or integration of biorefinery technologies in any developing country should be based on its waste characterization. Waste biorefineries if developed in developing countries could provide energy generation, land savings, new businesses and consequent job creation, savings of landfills costs, GHG emissions reduction, and savings of natural resources of land, soil, and groundwater. The challenges in route to successful implementation of biorefinery concept in the developing countries are also presented using life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the adoption of sustainability in supply chain is more concern for the manufacturing organisations. Constantly, changing market has insisted these organisations to revisit their supply chain activities in order to penetrate sustainability effectively through various practices such as lean, green, circular, and industry 4.0 etc. But, the lack of verified Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) frameworks has become a concern for the practitioners. Similarly, solutions required to overcome the SSCM adoption issues also need to be updated accordingly to changing business environments. So, the present study aims to develop a framework to overcome SSCM challenges through industry 4.0 and circular economy based solution measures. This study identifies a unique set of 28 SSCM challenges and 22 solution measures. Further, an automotive case organisation is used to test the applicability of the developed framework through hybrid Best Worst Method (BWM)- ELimination and Choice Expressing REality (ELECTRE) approach. The inputs for BWM-ELECTRE approach is obtained by constructing an expert panel within the case organisation. Initial inputs are taken for BWM comparisons to compute the weight of SSCM challenges; whereas, further a comparison of challenges and solution measures is also obtained for ELECTRE approach to compute the final ranking of the solution measures to overcome SSCM challenges. The case findings reveal that managerial and organisational challenges and economic challenges emerge as most critical to SSCM adoption. The present study outcomes will be beneficial for researchers working in SSCM industry 4.0 and circular economy domain; whereas, the practitioners can use the prioritised solution measures to formulate effective strategies to overcome SSCM adoption failures.

Thus far, research on the circular economy has focused on methods for better conserving the value in material flows. As the CE is currently being adopted as a sustainable development strategy in, e.g., China and the EU, identifying and comparing the drivers of and barriers to CE implementation would be beneficial for the acceleration of the development path. To contribute toward this research area, we built on institutional theory via a multiple case study covering China, the US, and Europe. We analyzed each region as an institutional environment and considered manufacturer and integrator types of value chain actors due to their central role in CE implementation. As our key findings, we identified that the general drivers of the CE from each institutional environment support recycling as the primary CE action, while support for other CE types appears to be lacking. Regulatory measures have primarily driven increased recycling efforts on both the integrator and manufacturer sides. Similarly, identified normative indicators overwhelmingly point toward recycling, while increasing reuse faces cultural-cognitive barriers. Between regions, China differs due to its informal sector and strong regulative institutional support. We conclude that to improve institutional support for the CE and allow it to fulfill its potential as a sustainable growth model, diversified institutional support for reducing the products produced and materials used as well as increasing reuse are needed.","[Ranta, Valtteri; Aarikka-Stenroos, Leena; Makinen, Saku J.] Tampere Univ Technol, Lab Ind & Informat Management, POB 527, FI-33101 Tampere, Finland; [Ritala, Paavo] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, POB 20, FI-53851 Lappeenranta, Finland",Tampere University; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Ranta, V (corresponding author), Tampere Univ Technol, Lab Ind & Informat Management, POB 527, FI-33101 Tampere, Finland.",valtteri.ranta@tut.fi; leena.aarikka-stenroos@tut.fi; ritala@lut.fi; saku.makinen@tut.fi,"Ritala, Paavo/JOZ-8801-2023; Aarikka-Stenroos, Leena/O-7732-2016; makinen, saku j/G-4352-2014; Aarikka-Stenroos, Leena/A-6609-2015","Ranta, Valtteri/0000-0002-9593-2884; Ritala, Paavo/0000-0002-8525-4610; Makinen, Saku Juhani/0000-0001-5163-4757; Aarikka-Stenroos, Leena/0000-0001-9051-6059",Tekes - Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation,Tekes - Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation,The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the participants of the ARVI - Material Value Chains research program organized by Clic Innovation and related research funding from Tekes - the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation.,,55,294,301,13,199,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Consequentially, the British Standards Institution recently launched a new standard BS 8001:2017 - Framework for implementing the principles of the circular economy in organizations. BS 8001:2017 tries to reconcile the far-reaching ambitions of the CE with established business routines. The standard contains a comprehensive list of CE terms and definitions, a set of general CE principles, a flexible management framework for implementing CE strategies in organizations, and a detailed description of economic, environmental, design, marketing, and legal issues related to the CE. The guidance on monitoring CE strategy implementation, however, remains vague. The standard stipulates that organizations are solely responsible for choosing appropriate CE indicators. Its authors do not elaborate on the links between CE strategy monitoring and the relevant and already standardized quantitative tools life cycle assessment (LCA) and material flow cost accounting (MFCA). Here a general system definition for deriving CE indicators is proposed. Based on the system definition and the indicator literature a dashboard of new and established quantitative indicators for CE strategy assessment in organizations is then compiled. The dashboard indicators are mostly based on material flow analysis (MFA), MFCA, and LCA. Steel cycle data are used to illustrate potential core CE indicators, notably, the residence time of a material in the techno-sphere (currently 250-300 years for steel). Moreover, organizations need to monitor their contribution to in use-stock growth, a central driver of resource depletion and hindrance to closing material cycles.","[Pauliuk, Stefan] Univ Frethurg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Ind Ecol Grp, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",,"Pauliuk, S (corresponding author), Univ Frethurg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Ind Ecol Grp, Tennenbacher Str 4, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",stefan.pauliuk@indecol.uni-freiburg.de,"Pauliuk, Stefan/AAC-8274-2022","Pauliuk, Stefan/0000-0002-6869-1405","Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden Wurttemberg (Germany) [7635.521(15)]","Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden Wurttemberg (Germany)","This work was supported by grant no. 7635.521(15) from the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden Wurttemberg (Germany).",,129,292,299,6,115,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

It aims to innovate the entire chain of production, consumption, distribution and recovery of materials and energy according to a cradle to cradle vision. The awareness of increasing constraints on the availability of resources as well as the increasing demand for access to welfare and wellbeing by developing countries and social groups make it evident the need for new economic models capable to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of resource use. In the last two decades a growing literature addressed the environmental and economic impacts of construction and demolition (C&D) sectors, with special focus on the production and management of its waste materials. This study reviews and organizes the recent literature within the framework of the CE to explore how its key principles (Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle) apply to the management of C&D waste (C&DW). The reviewed literature mainly focuses on changes of environmental impacts as a consequence of CE implementation. Impacts have been mainly quantified by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, under the adoption of different boundaries of analysis, although other economic and biophysical approaches were also applied to a minor extent. The final goal of this study is evaluating if the adoption of the CE framework is environmentally and economically sustainable, given that the recovery of waste materials requires investments of resources. Different type of barriers (economic, political, legislative, informative and managerial) as well as solutions and success factors for implementing an effective management of C&DW within a circular framework are also pointed out. Results show that in most cases the reuse/recycling of C&DW at the end-of-life of a building as well as the production of recycled products provide environmental and economic benefits. Nevertheless, the environmental and economic sustainability of CE framework is very site specific and depends on several factors such as the type of material, building elements, transport distances, economic and political context. Finally, several directions for future research have been proposed: increased LCA modelling for sustainability evaluation, a wider development of cleaner production strategies focused on circular design, and finally the adoption of a comprehensive accounting of input and output flows, in order to assign appropriate weights to flows and benefits that are most often disregarded.

Presently in Europe, only about 10% of plastic waste is recycled, most of which is achieved through mechanical recycling. Chemical recycling methods like pyrolysis could significantly increase these recycling rates, as it can utilize mixtures of waste plastics unlike mechanical recycling. It can also be used to treat waste of many novel materials, such as composites, especially in the emerging phase when the volumes of the new materials in markets are low making separate collection of waste not a cost-efficient option. Pyrolysis offers an environmentally sound alternative to incineration and inefficient landfilling. Currently, main challenges for pyrolysis of plastic waste are unavailability and inconsistent quality of feedstock, inefficient and hence costly sorting, non-existent markets citing lack for standardized products, and unclear regulations around plastic waste management. Possible solutions could include tight cooperation between feedstock providers and converters for securing steady quantity and quality of feedstock. Advanced pre-treatment would provide the basis for cost-effective recycling. The classification of pyrolysis liquid as a product instead of waste is needed, and the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) registration should be carried out to standardise the liquid oil as a product. In addition, sustainability impacts need to be clearly positive.","[Qureshi, Muhammad Saad; Oasmaa, Anja; Pihkola, Hanna; Tenhunen, Anna; Mannila, Juha; Minkkinen, Hannu] VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Tietotie 4C, Espoo, Finland; [Deviatkin, Ivan] Lappeenranta Lahti Univ Technol LUT, Sch Energy Syst, Dept Sustainabil Sci, Lappeenranta 53850, Finland; [Pohjakallio, Maija] Sulapac Ltd, Iso Roobertinkatu 21, Helsinki 00120, Finland; [Laine-Ylijoki, Jutta] FCG Finnish Consulting Grp Ltd, Osmontie 34,PL 950, Helsinki 00601, Finland",VTT Technical Research Center Finland; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Qureshi, MS (corresponding author), VTT Tech Res Ctr Finland, Tietotie 4C, Espoo, Finland.",muhammad.qureshi@vtt.fi,"Deviatkin, Ivan/AAH-4476-2021; Qureshi, Muhammad saad/I-6011-2017; Pihkola, Hanna/KHV-7675-2024; , Ivan Deviatkin/AAM-3272-2021",", Ivan Deviatkin/0000-0002-7955-1029; Qureshi, Muhammad Saad/0000-0002-2601-4713; Pihkola, Hanna/0000-0003-1435-1402; Tenhunen-Lunkka, Anna/0000-0003-0063-4268; Oasmaa, Anja/0000-0003-4524-8002",Finnish national Business Finland WasteBuster project [BF 5401/31/2016],Finnish national Business Finland WasteBuster project,The research received financial support through the Finnish national Business Finland WasteBuster project (BF 5401/31/2016).,,80,288,301,44,371,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0165-2370,1873-250X,,J ANAL APPL PYROL,J.

At the same time, these technologies support the implementation of the circular economy (CE) paradigm into businesses. Despite this general agreement, the literature still overlooks how digital technologies enable such a CE transition. To fill the gap, this paper develops a conceptual framework, based on the literature and a case study of a company implementing a usage-focused servitized business model in the household appliance industry. This study focuses on the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data, and analytics, and identifies eight specific functionalities enabled by such technologies (improving product design, attracting target customers, monitoring and tracking product activity, providing technical support, providing preventive and predictive maintenance, optimizing the product usage, upgrading the product, enhancing renovation and end-of-life activities). By investigating how these functionalities affect three CE value drivers (increasing resource efficiency, extending lifespan, and closing the loop), the conceptual framework developed in this paper advances knowledge about the role of digital technologies as an enabler of the CE within usage-focused business models. Finally, this study shows how digital technologies help overcome the drawback of usage-focused business models for the adoption of CE pointed out by previous literature.","[Bressanelli, Gianmarco; Adrodegari, Federico; Perona, Marco; Saccani, Nicola] Univ Brescia, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, RISE Lab, I-25123 Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia,"Bressanelli, G (corresponding author), Univ Brescia, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, RISE Lab, I-25123 Brescia, Italy.",g.bressanelli002@unibs.it; federico.adrodegari@unibs.it; marco.perona@unibs.it; nicola.saccani@unibs.it,"Bressanelli, Gianmarco/A-5115-2019; Saccani, Nicola/KEH-5062-2024; santana, elysmara S D/P-2636-2016","Bressanelli, Gianmarco/0000-0003-2255-9983; PERONA, MARCO/0000-0002-9082-2950; SACCANI, NICOLA/0000-0002-4603-5060; ADRODEGARI, Federico/0000-0001-7939-4150",European Union [609005],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors would like to acknowledge the three anonymous reviewers for their helpful suggestions and constructive criticisms.

Our propositions are based on the following arguments: a shift from product ownership to leasing and access in supply chain relationships; the relevance of structural flexibility and start-ups in regional or local loops; open and closed material loops in technical and biological cycles; closer collaboration within and beyond immediate industry boundaries and public and private procurement in the service industry as a lever for the scaling up of circular business models.

Besides these beneficial properties, food packaging causes rising concern for the environment due to its high production volume, often short usage time, and problems related to waste management and littering. Reduction, reuse, and recycling, but also redesign support the aims of the circular economy. These tools also have the potential to decrease the environmental impact of food packaging. In this article, we focus on chemical safety aspects of recycled food packaging, as recycling is currently seen as an important measure to manage packaging waste. However, recycling may increase the levels of potentially hazardous chemicals in the packaging and-after migration-in the food. Since exposure to certain chemicals migrating from food packaging has been associated with chronic diseases, it is of high importance to assess the safety of recycled packaging. Therefore, we describe recycling processes of commonly used food packaging materials, including plastics, paper and board, aluminum, steel, and multimaterial multilayers (e.g., beverage cartons). Further, we give an overview of typical migrants from all types of recycled food packaging materials, and summarize approaches to reduce chemical contamination. We discuss the role of food packaging in the circular economy, where recycling is only one of many complementary tools for providing environmentally-friendly and safe food packaging.

In this research we conduct a review of the scientific literature relative to CE and propose operational principles which join the theoretical goals of CE within the sustainable development framework to practical strategies of implementation. This research resulted in seven operational principles: i) adjusting inputs to the system to regeneration rates, ii) adjusting outputs from the system to absorption rates, iii) closing the system, iv) maintaining the value of resources within the system, v) reducing the system's size, vi) designing for CE, and vii) educating for CE.

In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy?

Coordinated development of social economic development and ecological environmental development is very necessary for sustainable urban development. We examined the coupling coordinated development situation among the vital urban areas-China's 31 provincial capital cities. Results show the cities are classified into four categories: joint high class (7 cites), social economy-high class (5 cites), joint-low class (9 cites), and ecological environment-high class (10 cites). We also discussed key issues existing in the coupling coordinated development. Beijing, Hangzhou, etc. show the best coupling coordinated degrees, presenting harmonious relationship between advanced social economy and sound eco-environment. Yinchuan and Lhasa rank at the bottom in the studied cities in terms of coupling coordinated development, they need to promote social economic development conforming to the unique ecological environment and capacity to achieve coordinated development. The overall spatial pattern of coupling coordinated development can be verbalized as east and south high, west and north low. Urban development paths for various areas and policy implications were provided based on this study.

As such, for a circular economy to thrive, products need to be designed for closed loops, as well as be adapted to generate revenues. This should not only be at the point of purchase, but also during use, and be supported by low-cost return chains and reprocessing structures, as well as effective policy and regulation. To date, most academic and grey literature on the circular economy has focused primarily on the development of new business models, with some of the latter studies addressing design strategies for a circular economy, specifically in the area of resource cycles and design for product life extension. However, these studies primarily consider a limited spectrum of the technical and biological cycles where materials are recovered and restored and nutrients (e.g., materials, energy, water) are regenerated. This provides little guidance or clarity for designers wishing to design for new circular business models in practice. As such, this paper aims to address this gap by systematically analysing previous literature on Design for Sustainability (DfX) (e.g., design for resource conservation, design for slowing resource loops and whole systems design) and links these approaches to the current literature on circular business models. A conceptual framework is developed for circular economy design strategies. From this conceptual framework, recommendations are made to enable designers to fully consider the holistic implications for design within a circular economy.","[Moreno, Mariale; De los Rios, Carolina; Rowe, Zoe; Charnley, Fiona] Cranfield Univ, Ctr Competit Creat Design C4D, Coll Rd, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"Charnley, F (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Ctr Competit Creat Design C4D, Coll Rd, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",m.moreno@cranfield.ac.uk; i.hdelosrios@gmail.com; z.o.rowe@cranfield.ac.uk; f.j.charnley@cranfield.ac.uk,,"Charnley, Fiona/0000-0001-5533-5375; Moreno, Mariale/0000-0002-1264-639X",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [EP/M017567/1]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/M017567/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/M017567/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"Part of this work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Grant (EP/M017567/1).

To that end, a survey was carried out in Navarra and the Basque Country, Spain. The main results show that companies are focused on complying with the law and, in many cases, they are worried about their company's image. Moreover, they do not tend to be committed to environmental issues because they do not think it would increase their profits and competitiveness. The focus on cost savings became clear from the Factor Analysis applied to the Take-Transform and Recovery phases of the Circular Economy. In this sense, three factors were associated with the companies' perception of the Circular Economy: 1) Material Provision, 2) Resources' Reutilization and 2) Financial Advantage. With regard to the barriers, another Factor Analysis suggested two different categories of barriers: Hard barriers and Human-based barriers, each requiring different strategies for addressing them, must be considered. Finally, the study briefly examines the integration opportunities between SMEs with other companies and industry associations or clusters to develop industrial symbiosis and close their materials loop.

However, as both CE and DTs are emerging fields, there exists little systematic guidance on how DTs can be applied to capture the full potential of circular strategies for improving resource efficiency and productivity. Furthermore, there is little insight into the supporting business analytics (BA) capabilities required to accomplish this. To address this gap, this paper conducts a theoryand practice-based review, resulting in the Smart CE framework that supports translating the circular strategies central to the goals of manufacturing companies in con-tributing the United Nation's (UN) 12th Sustainable Development Goal, that is, sustainable consumption and production, into the BA requirements of DTs. Both scholars and practitioners may find the framework useful to (1) create a common language for aligning activities across the boundaries of disciplines such as information systems and the CE body of knowledge, and (2) identify the gap between the current and entailed BA requirements and identify the strategic initiatives needed to close it. Additionally, the framework is used to organize a database of case examples to identify some best practices related to specific smart circular strategies.","[Kristoffersen, Eivind] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Mikalef, Patrick] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Li, Jingyue] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Area Software Engn & Artificial Intelligence, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Blomsma, Fenna] Univ Hamburg, Circular Econ & Syst Innovat, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Hamburg,"Kristoffersen, E (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Comp Sci, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",eivind.kristoffersen@ntnu.no; fenna.blomsma@uni-hamburg.de; patrick.mikalef@ntnu.no; jingyue.li@ntnu.no,"Mikalef, Patrick/GVU-5020-2022","Mikalef, Patrick/0000-0002-6788-2277; Kristoffersen, Eivind/0000-0002-9993-4414; Blomsma, Fenna/0000-0002-0996-4717","research project CIRCit (Circular Economy Integration in the Nordic Industry for Enhanced Sustainability and Competitiveness), Nordic Green Growth Research and Innovation Programme [83144]; NordForsk; Nordic Energy Research; Nordic Innovation","research project CIRCit (Circular Economy Integration in the Nordic Industry for Enhanced Sustainability and Competitiveness), Nordic Green Growth Research and Innovation Programme; NordForsk(NordForsk); Nordic Energy Research; Nordic Innovation","The authors would like to thank the reviewers of this paper.

In this regard, a bio-based circular economy considers organic wastes and residues as potential resources that can be utilized to supply chemicals, nutrients, and fuels needed by mankind. This review explored the role of aerobic and anaerobic digestion technologies for the advancement of a bio-based circular society. The developed routes within the anaerobic digestion domain, such as the production of biogas and other high-value chemicals (volatile fatty acids) were discussed. The potential to recover important nutrients, such as nitrogen through composting, was also addressed. An emphasis was made on the innovative models for improved economics and process performance, which include co-digestion of various organic solid wastes, recovery of multiple bio-products, and integrated bioprocesses.","[Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar; Awasthi, Sanjeev Kumar; Liu, Tao; Duan, Yumin; Zhang, Zengqiang] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wainaina, Steven; Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar; Taherzadeh, Mohammad J.] Univ Boras, Swedish Ctr Resource Recovery, S-50190 Boras, Sweden; [Singh, Ekta; Kumar, Aman] CSIR, Natl Environm Engn Res Inst, Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440020, Maharashtra, India; [Chen, Hongyu] Free Univ Berlin, Inst Biol, Altensteinstr 6, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Ravindran, B.; Kumar, Sunil] Kyonggi Univ, Dept Environm Energy & Engn, Suwon 16227, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Sarsaiya, Surendra] Zunyi Med Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Basic Pharmacol, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Sarsaiya, Surendra] Zunyi Med Univ, Minist Educ, Joint Int Res Lab Ethnomed, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; University of Boras; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI); Free University of Berlin; Kyonggi University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University,"Awasthi, MK (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",mukesh_awasthi45@yahoo.com,"Sarsaiya, Surendra/K-6970-2019; chen, hongyu/HHS-4314-2022; Kumar, Aman/AAC-4866-2021; Chen, Hongyu/JGM-9228-2023; Taherzadeh, Mohammad J./B-5950-2009; Kumar, Sunil/ACO-2985-2022; singh, ekta/AAB-4357-2021; Zhang, Zengqiang/J-3167-2014; Wainaina, Steven/AAD-2310-2020; Taherzadeh, Mohammad/AAM-5414-2021; Wainaina, Steven/K-4424-2017; Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar/P-8297-2017; Balasubramani, Ravindran/G-7798-2019","Sarsaiya, Surendra/0000-0002-0850-8592; Kumar, Aman/0000-0002-4061-562X; Taherzadeh, Mohammad J./0000-0003-4887-2433; Kumar, Sunil/0000-0003-1090-2684; singh, ekta/0000-0002-0115-7873; Zhang, Zengqiang/0000-0002-6860-9328; Taherzadeh, Mohammad/0000-0003-4887-2433; Wainaina, Steven/0000-0003-4709-5126; Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar/0000-0003-0879-184X; Balasubramani, Ravindran/0000-0001-8764-7840","National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [31750110469]; Shaanxi Introduced Talent Research Funding, China [A279021901]; Introduction of Talent Research Start-up Fund, College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi Province, China [Z101021904]; Mobility for Regional Excellence-2020 [RUN 2017-00771]; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant at University of Boras, Boras, Sweden [754412]; Guizhou Science and Technology Corporation Platform Talents Fund, China [[2017]5733-001, CK-1130-002]","National Natural Science Foundation of China, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shaanxi Introduced Talent Research Funding, China; Introduction of Talent Research Start-up Fund, College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi Province, China; Mobility for Regional Excellence-2020; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant at University of Boras, Boras, Sweden(European Union (EU)); Guizhou Science and Technology Corporation Platform Talents Fund, China","This work was supported by a research fund from the International Young Scientists from National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 31750110469), China; the Shaanxi Introduced Talent Research Funding (A279021901), China and The Introduction of Talent Research Start-up Fund (Grant No. Z101021904), College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi Province 712100, China.

In parallel to this, the circular economy discourse has been propagated in the industrial ecology and production economics literature and, lately, in business and practice. The ideals of circular economy principles suggests that the frontiers of environmental sustainability can be pushed by emphasising the idea of transforming products in such a way that there are workable relationships between ecological systems and economic growth. By arguing for these ideals to be integrated into green supply chain management theory and practice, the paper uses a case study from the construction industry to demonstrate the environmental gains in terms of carbon emissions that can be achieved through some circular economy principles as against traditional linear production systems. The paper therefore asserts that an integration of circular economy principles within sustainable supply chain management can provide clear advantages from an environmental point view despite some external supply chain influences and scenarios. Further to this, emerging supply chain management challenges and market dynamics are also highlighted and discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Through a systematic literature review, this paper identifies and systematises 24 challenges that may hamper a supply chain redesign for the Circular Economy. Sixteen among these challenges are well known from research in related topics. On the contrary, the remaining eight are relatively new or take a different relevance within the Circular Economy context. A multiple case study in the household appliance supply chain is carried out, to explore how these challenges appear in practice and how companies may tackle them. The cases analysed involve actors at different supply chain levels, and findings suggest that a great degree of vertical integration by one actor in the supply chain is not a necessary condition for Circular Economy implementation. The empirical study, in conjunction with the literature analysis, leads to the development of a framework linking the challenges to specific levers that companies may pursue to overcome them. The framework can be seen as a reference for managers undertaking the path towards Circular Economy.","[Bressanelli, Gianmarco; Perona, Marco; Saccani, Nicola] Univ Brescia, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, RISE Lab, Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia,"Bressanelli, G (corresponding author), Univ Brescia, Dept Mech & Ind Engn, RISE Lab, Brescia, Italy.",g.bressanelli002@unibs.it,"Bressanelli, Gianmarco/A-5115-2019; Saccani, Nicola/KEH-5062-2024","Bressanelli, Gianmarco/0000-0003-2255-9983; PERONA, MARCO/0000-0002-9082-2950; SACCANI, NICOLA/0000-0002-4603-5060",,,,,89,260,269,40,386,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0020-7543,1366-588X,,INT J PROD RES,Int.

Recognizing sludge as a resource, not as a waste, has made researchers consider the recovery of valuable components from sludge, such as carbon and nutrients. The energy that can be obtained from wastewater sludge may be a sustainable solution to fulfill present and future energy requirements. This review discusses about the types of sludge produced by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the technologies that can be implemented in the water and sludge line to reduce the sludge amount, as well as the conventional treatment and disposal methods. Moreover, the technologies that can be used to recover resources and energy in the context of circular economy are also presented, with a focus on Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and a critical overview of positive and negative aspects in implementation. A detailed description of some urban biorefineries aimed at the recovery of cellulose and nutrients and the production of bioplastics is further reported.

J,"Rhodes, CJ",,,,"Rhodes, Christopher J.",,,Plastic pollution and potential solutions,SCIENCE PROGRESS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,MICROPLASTIC POLLUTION; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; ORGANIC POLLUTANTS; SYNTHETIC-FIBERS; GARBAGE PATCH; HUMAN HEALTH; GREAT-LAKES; BISPHENOL-A; DEBRIS,"A review is presented of the manufacture and use of different types of plastic, and the effects of pollution by these materials on animal, human and environmental health, insofar as this is known. Since 2004, the world has made as much plastic as it did in the previous half century, and it has been reckoned that the total mass of virgin plastics ever made amounts to 8.3 billion tonnes, mainly derived from natural gas and crude oil, used as chemical feedstocks and fuel sources. Between 1950 and 2015, a total of 6.3 billion tonnes of primary and secondary (recycled) plastic waste was generated, of which around 9% has been recycled, and 12% incinerated, with the remaining 79% either being stored in landfills or having been released directly into the natural environment. In 2015, 407 million tonnes (Mt) of plastic was produced, of which 164 Mt was consumed by packaging (36% of total). Although quoted values vary, packaging probably accounts for around one third of all plastics used, of which approximately 40% goes to landfill, while 32% escapes the collection system. It has been deduced that around 9 Mt ofplastic entered the oceans in 2010, as a result of mismanaged waste, along with up to 0.5 Mt each of microplastics from washing synthetic textiles, and from the abrasion of tyres on road surfaces. However, the amount of plastics actually measured in the oceans represents less than 1% of the (at least) 150 Mt reckoned to have been released into the oceans over time. Plastic accounts for around 10% by mass of municipal waste, but up to 85% of marine debris items - most of which arrive from land-based sources. Geographically, the five heaviest plastic polluters are P.R. China, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, which between them contribute 56% of global plastic waste. Larger, primary plastic items can undergo progressive fragmentation to yield a greater number of increasingly smaller 'secondary' microplastic particles, thus increasing the overall surface area of the plastic material, which enhances its ability to absorb, and concentrate, persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), with the potential to transfer them to the tissues of animals that ingest the microplastic particles, particularly in marine environments. Although fears that such microparticles and their toxins may be passed via Pod webs to humans are not as yet substantiated, the direct ingestion of inicroplastics by humans via drinking water is a distinct possibility - since 92% of samples taken in the USA and 72% in Europe showed their presence - although any consequent health effects are as yet unclear. Foodstuffs may also become contaminated by microplastics from the air, although any consequent health effects are also unknown. In regard to such airborne sources, it is noteworthy that small plastic particles have been found in human lung tissue, which might prove an adverse health issue under given circumstances. It is also very striking that microplastics have been detected in mountain soils in Switzerland, which are most likely windborne in origin. Arctic ice core samples too have revealed the presence of microplastics, which were most likely carried on ocean currents from the Pacific garbage patch, and from local pollution from shipping and fishing. Thus, sea ice traps large amounts of microplastics and transports them across the Arctic Ocean, but these particles will be released into the global environment when the ice melts, particularly under the influence of a rising mean global temperature. While there is a growing emphasis toward the substitution of petrochemically derived plastics by bioplastics, controversy has arisen in regard to how biodegradable the latter actually are in the open environment, and they presently only account for 0.5% of the total mass of plastics manufactured globally. Since the majority of bioplastics are made from sugar and starch materials, to expand their use significantly raises the prospect of competition between growing crops to supply food or plastics, similarly to the diversion of food crops for the manufacture of primary biofuels. The use of oxo-plastics, which contain additives that assist the material to degrade, is also a matter of concern, since it is claimed that they merely fragment and add to the environmental burden of microplastics; hence, the European Union has moved to restrict their use. Since 6% of the current global oil (including natural gas liquids, NGLs) production is used to manufacture plastic commodities predicted to rise to 20% by 2050 the current approaches for the manufacture and use of plastics (including their end-use) demand immediate revision. More extensive collection and recycling of plastic items at the end of their life, for re-use in new production, to offset the use of virgin plastic, is a critical aspect both for reducing the amount of plastic waste entering the environment, and in improving the efficiency of fossil resource use. This is central to the ideology underpinning the circular economy, which has common elements with permacultum, the latter being a regenerative design system based on 'nature as teacher' which could help optimise the use of resources in town and city environments, while minimising and reputposing 'waste'. Thus food might be produced more on the local than the global scale, with smaller inputs of filels (including transportation fuels for importing and distributing food), water and fertilisers, and with a marked reduction in the use of plastic packaging. Such an approach, adopted by billions of individuals, could prove of immense significance in ensuring future food security, and in reducing waste and pollution - of all kinds.","[Rhodes, Christopher J.] Fresh Lands Environm Act, Www Fresh Lands Com, Caversham, Berks, England",,"Rhodes, CJ (corresponding author), Fresh Lands Environm Act, Www Fresh Lands Com, Caversham, Berks, England.",cjrhodes@fresh-lands.com,,,,,,,217,256,280,70,1197,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0036-8504,2047-7163,,SCI PROGRESS-UK,Sci.

It requires companies to design their business model (i.e., the value network, the relationships with the supply chain partners, and the value propositions towards customers) around a new concept of sustainable development that reduces consumption of natural resources and preserves the environment. However, extant research falls short in terms of explaining how companies design their business model according to the circular economy principles.

Therefore, envisioning a future where nothing is wasted; a future where every waste becomes an asset, and no value goes unrecovered; a future where all products at the end of their primary use are recovered and either reused, remanufactured, or recycled for multiple generations, has become more than a reality, but a necessity. This emerging concept of circular economy, although gaining attention, lacks a technological perspective for effective implementation. This paper presents the principles of sustainable manufacturing to serve as the basis, and to provide the technological elements to ensure the creation of a circular economy. 6R-based technological elements are identified and shown as essential ingredients for achieving economic growth, environmental protection and societal benefits.

This happens because the construction sector mostly adopts a linear economic model of take, make, dispose, using materials to the construction of buildings and disposing them at the end of life, since they are assembled for one time use and don't retain potential for reuse. Over the last decades, a paradigm shift has been occurring in the industry at large, with the adoption of a Circular Economy model, that aims at keeping the materials in a closed loop to retain their maximum value, therefore with a greater potential of reducing the waste generation and resources extraction for the Construction Industry. This article aims at finding the recent developments of how Circular Economy can be used inside the construction industry. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted, including 45 articles that were divided into six areas of research: development of Circular Economy, reuse of materials, material stocks, Circular Economy in the built environment, LCA analysis and material passport. An analysis of the content of these articles was made and the knowledge gaps in this area were identified, as well as table with known Circular Economy practices for the Construction Industry was created divided by life cycle stages.

Manufacturing industries have started adopting sustainable manufacturing practices and a circular economy in their supply chain to mitigate environmental concerns, as sustainable manufacturing practices and a circular economy result in the reduction of waste generation and energy and material usage. The leather industry, in spite of it contributing remarkably to a country's economic growth and stability, does not bear a good image because of its role in polluting the environment. Therefore, the leather industries of Bangladesh are trying to implement sustainable manufacturing practices as a part of undertaking green supply chain initiatives to remedy their image with the buyer and to comply with government rules and regulations. The main contribution of this study is to assess, prioritize and rank the drivers of sustainable manufacturing practices in the leather industries of Bangladesh. We have used graph theory and a matrix approach to examine the drivers. The results show that knowledge of the circular economy is paramount to implementing sustainable manufacturing practices in the leather industry of Bangladesh. This study will assist managers of leather companies to formulate strategies for the optimum utilization of available resources, as well as for the reduction of waste in the context of the circular economy.

To understand resource recirculation in practice, this paper analyses over 50 examples of products developed from discarded materials, categorising them into the recovery routes described in the circular economy literature. The examples were obtained during interviews with waste management professionals and designers who had developed products with discards. Practical challenges to implementing a circular economy were identified based on the example categorisation and comments from the interviews. The main difference observed was that the examples mostly recirculate resources to make different types of products, whereas a circular economy requires manufacturing companies to take back their own products to secure their material resources. This is partly because in practice the material collection system in place is waste management, rather than manufacturing-centred take-back systems. A revised model for recovery routes in society in which waste management is allocated an important role in facilitating material recirculation is therefore presented. The study highlights that current product design is facing a new challenge of anticipating social, economic and environmental challenges to realise the goals of a circular economy.

As a consequence, the production and the use of Lithium-ion batteries will continuously increase in the near future, focusing the global attention on their End-of-Life management. Unfortunately, wasted Lithium-ion batteries treatments are still under development, far from the optimization of recycling processes and technologies, and currently recycling represents the only alternative for the social, economic and environmental sustainability of this market, able to minimize toxicity of End-of-Life products, to create a monetary gain and to lead to the independence from foreign resources or critical materials. This paper analyses the current alternatives for the recycling of Lithium-ion batteries, specifically focusing on available procedures for batteries securing and discharging, mechanical pre-treatments and materials recovery processes (i.e. pyro- and hydrometallurgical), and it highlights the pros and cons of treatments in terms of energy consumption, recovery efficiency and safety issues. Target metals (e.g. Cobalt, Nickel and Lithium) are listed and prioritized, and the economic advantage deriving by the material recovery is outlined.

One of the key strategies to overcome these problems is using waste as a resource, i.e. evolving toward a circular economy. To monitor this transition, suitable indicators are needed that focus on sustainability issues whilst taking into account the technical reality. In this paper, we develop such an indicator to quantify the circular economy performance of different plastic waste treatment options. This indicator is based on the technical quality of the plastic waste stream and evaluates resource consumption by using the Cumulative Exergy Extraction from the Natural Environment (CEENE) method. To illustrate the use of this new indicator, it was applied in a case study on post-industrial plastic waste treatment. The results show that the indicator can be a very useful approach to guide waste streams towards their optimal valorization option, based on quality of the waste flow and the environmental benefit of the different options.

An intervention is needed to bring stakeholders together to solve these waste challenges. The objectives of this study are to investigate the fundamental issues and opportunities and to develop a sustainable and smart country-wide waste management system using industry 4.0 technologies. The system should provide a multi-dimensional approach, determine the maturity level of the waste management system in a technical method, and pursue the goal of designing a new strategy to minimise waste management problems. A comprehensive systematic literature review, intensive focus group discussions, and direct observation in Indonesian cities were approaches used to develop waste management business processes and their system design. Waste business processes consist of mixed-collecting, sorting, transporting, varied-treatment, and chained-disposal. The design of the proposed waste management system presents circular economy processes that can separate municipal waste, identify waste characteristics, and determine sustainable waste treatment technologies through the use of Internet of Thing (IoT) as the integrator. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Good health, and wellbeing (SDG 3); Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13). The study proposes a new design of smart and sustainable waste management which could achieve satisfactory economic, social, and environmental waste management performances. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Arrival of Industry 4.0 is set to transform organisational activities through various technological innovations. Blockchain is such a critical technology. Yet, the breadth of the blockchain concept and its application require nuanced investigation in different contexts, including examining some tensions with the applications. This paper examines how blockchain technology is likely to transform and advance circular economy realisation. Using grounded theory building from multiple case studies, we present early evidence linking the blockchain application to circular economy dimensions of regenerate, share, optimise, loop, virtualise, and exchange (ReSOLVE model). Case studies of blockchain application in various industrial sectors, at different adoption levels, for diverse organisational purposes are analysed and discussed. We systematically examine the practices, gaps, potential tensions, and critical reflections.

This study focuses on the environmental value propositions of the CE business models. The term environmental value proposition refers here to an absolute value being a promise of environmental improvement, which a company provides to the environment by its impacts throughout the whole value chain. The aim of this study is to outline a framework for evaluating the environmental value propositions of CE business models. The framework consists of an environmental value propositions table (EVPT) and a step-by-step approach towards an evaluation process. The framework was tested in three CE business model cases. The outlined framework enables a better understanding of circular economy principles, combining them with the environmental value proposition. With the framework, companies can plan and design new CE business models or they can verify intended environmental benefits and analyse their contribution to sustainability. The biggest challenges, when applying the framework, were related to the estimation of environmental benefits gained from the environmental value propositions at the system level. In the future, intensive scientific work should concentrate on developing environmental assessment methods specifically for companies developing new CE business models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In order for a circular economy to materialize, an integrated approach that focuses on a long-term system change or transition is required. To set the change process in motion, many (public and private) players (companies, authorities, citizens, and research institutions) need to be involved. Among the many stakeholders, a genuine enabler to implement a successful and sustainable circular strategy is the logistics industry. Given that The Netherlands is used as a case study, in this paper, we focus on the Dutch logistics industry and how this industry can contribute to the broader Dutch agenda to realize a more circular economy. It implies looking at the specific transition agenda for the logistics industry in relation to a circular economy, what barriers may exist that might hamper such a transition, and how public policy-makers are dealing with and can tackle these barriers.","[van Buren, Nicole; Demmers, Marjolein] Council Environm & Infrastruct Rli, Oranjebuitensingel 6,POB 20906, NL-2500 EX The Hague, Netherlands; [Demmers, Marjolein] Dutch Sustainable Business Assoc De Groene Zaak, Zuid Hollandlaan 7, NL-2596 AL The Hague, Netherlands; [van der Heijden, Rob] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen Sch Management, POB 9108, NL-6500 HK Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Witlox, Frank] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281,S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Witlox, Frank] Univ Tartu, Dept Geog, Vanemuise 46, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia",Radboud University Nijmegen; Ghent University; University of Tartu,"Witlox, F (corresponding author), Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, Krijgslaan 281,S8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;Witlox, F (corresponding author), Univ Tartu, Dept Geog, Vanemuise 46, EE-51014 Tartu, Estonia.",nicole.van.buren@rli.nl; marjolein.demmers@degroenezaak.com; r.vanderheijden@fm.ru.nl; frank.witlox@ugent.be,"Witlox, Frank/A-5143-2008","Witlox, Frank/0000-0002-8966-6823",,,,,39,239,252,3,79,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2016,8,7,,,,,,,647,10.3390/su8070647,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su8070647,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DS4OM,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000380760400058,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, in the past landfill mining was not performed with a focus on resource recovery. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the concept of Enhanced Landfill Mining, defined as the safe conditioning, excavation and integrated valorization of landfilled waste streams as both materials and energy, using innovative transformation technologies and respecting the most stringent social and ecological criteria. The feasibility of ELFM is studied by synthesizing the research on the Closing the Circle project, the first ELFM project targeting the 18 million metric ton landfill in Houthalen-Helchteren in the East of Belgium. It is argued that Environmental Impact Assessments of ELFM projects should be wide in scope and time. Embedded in a broad resource management perspective, the worldwide potential of ELFM is highlighted, in terms of climate gains, materials and energy utilization, job creation and land reclamation. The potential is quantified for the EU-27 with its 150,000-500,000 landfills. However, for ELFM to reach its full potential, strategic policy decisions and tailored support systems, including combined incentives for material recycling, energy utilization and nature restoration, are required.

Chosen as a demonstration city, Dalian has implemented the CE strategy as a means of conserving water, materials, energy and land. This paper outlines some of the regional CE initiatives that have been successful to date in Dalian, including those focusing on conserving energy and water resources and others focusing on reduced industrial emissions. The paper details the approach used in implementing the CE concept in Dalian, tracing the foci and goals of the program, and the sectoral approach used to implement a CE. Although Dalian municipality has achieved many successes in implementing a CE, our paper identifies several challenges that, until recently. have held back complete implementation. These include: the lack of incentives for older industries to 'green' their operations, the lack of financial support to expand the CE concept, and a broad-based need for heightened public awareness and participation in CE initiatives. Our paper then identifies several responses by Dalian municipality to overcome these challenges, including pricing and tax reforms that serve as conservation incentives, the provision of financial support for CE promotion through budget reorganization, and the organization of CE training programs. Our paper concludes that, although CE initiatives have been successful in Dalian, more is possible and more is needed before Dalian can be designated a true 'eco-city'.

This will enable the reduction of eutrophication of surface waters due to the presence of nitrogen and phosphorus, originating from agricultural fields fertilizers. The use of biological waste is a practical solution to recover valuable fertilizer components.

However, successful adoption and implementation of this paradigm of managing business remains a challenge. In this article, we build a case for utilizing big data analytics (BDA) as a fundamental basis for informed and data driven decision making in supply chain networks supporting CE. We view this from a stakeholder perspective and argue that a collaborative association among all supply chain members can positively affect CE implementation. We propose a model highlighting the facilitating role of big data analytics for achieving shared sustainability goals. The model is based on integrating thematic categories coming out of 10 semi-structured interviews with key position holders in industry. We argue that mutual support and coordination driven by a stakeholder perspective coupled with holistic information processing and sharing along the entire supply chain network can effectively create a basis for achieving the triple bottom line of economic, ecological and social benefits. The proposed model is useful for managers in that it provides a reference point for aligning activities with the circular economy paradigm. The conceptual model provides a theoretical basis for future empirical research in this domain.","[Gupta, Shivam] Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, F-34185 Montpellier, France; [Chen, Haozhe] Iowa State Univ, Coll Business, 3183 Gerdin Business Bldg,2167 Union Dr, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Hazen, Benjamin T.] Air Force Inst Technol, Logist & Supply Chain Management, 2950 Hobson Way, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45419 USA; [Kaur, Sarabjot] Indian Inst Technol IIT Kanpur, Dept Ind & Management Engn, Kanpur 208016, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Santibanez Gonzalez, Ernesto D.

In this study, we examine how knowledge of remanufactured products in terms of cost, quality, and green attributes affects consumers' perception of both risk and value associated with purchasing remanufactured products, and how these perceptions subsequently affect consumers' purchase intentions in China. Based on prospect theory and literature on consumer perceived value and perceived risk, we use a 2 x 2 x 2 inter-group experiment to assess consumers' intention to purchase remanufactured products. The results of our structural equation modeling indicate that purchase intention is positively influenced by perceived value and negatively influenced by perceived risk. Perceived value is most influenced by quality knowledge, followed by cost knowledge and green knowledge. Perceived risk is most influenced by quality knowledge, followed by cost knowledge. The findings can help remanufacturers and closed-loop supply chain managers to develop management policies and marketing strategies. Our theory-based model can be used as the basis for future research regarding the consumer's role in the close-loop supply chain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Trends such as circular economy, fair trade, lowsumerism, and sharing economy are some of the many emerging entrepreneurial approaches that address this issue, but there is still a gap between what theory argues and the levels of environmental and social sustainability realized when theory is put into practice. In fact, most research on the topic of sustainable business models is still exploratory and does not fully acknowledge these emerging approaches, whose definitions, boundaries, and defining characteristics are still somewhat vague. This study seeks to contribute to the understanding of the inner entrepreneurial dynamics of innovative sustainable business models. In particular, we focus on the fashion business, a resource-intensive industry in which opportunities to reduce environmental impacts and to innovate business models abound. The aim of our research is to investigate innovative business models in the fashion industry that have sustainability as their defining characteristic, especially in terms of value proposition. In order to do that, we combine a systematic review of the literature with empirical research comprised of six interviews with specialists in sustainability, business model innovation, and the fashion industry, along with eight case studies on innovative fashion startups we define as 'born sustainable.' As a result, we propose a synthesizing framework that discloses trends and drivers of innovative and sustainable business models in the fashion industry. We also highlight opportunities and challenges for researchers and entrepreneurs interested in this topic. (C) 2017 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The findings show that institutional pressure has a significant positive impact on supply chain relationship management and sustainable supply chain design; sustainable supply chain management practice is an important factor promoting the improvement of the circular economy capability of companies, and coercive pressure, normative pressure, and mimetic pressure exert different degrees of negative moderating effects.

The database was obtained from Scopus and includes a total of 3148 articles, which were analysed using the bibliometric method. This method focuses on the identification, evolution, approaches and trends referred to in the use and transformation of agricultural waste. The results of the analysis of the most specific variables, some of which are represented graphically through clusters in networking maps using VOSviewer software, establishes that agricultural waste has been studied worldwide for more than 60 years and that research on this issue has become more relevant from 1998. However, it has been in the last 13 years that more than 60% of the scientific production on this field of study has been generated. The United States, India and China are the countries with the greatest number of studies, whose central axis has been the use and exploitation of agricultural residues, derived from cereal crops, mainly wheat and corn, as they are the main producers of this type of crops. Many authors, mainly from government and academic institutions, have contributed considerably to this research topic. The evolution of their studies evidences a change in the original approach, due to the influence of the new global energy and environmental policies developed during the last decade. Undoubtedly, the international regulatory framework on sustainable development has been transforming the role of agriculture and especially the policies and strategies on the circular economy and bioeconomy. New and better techniques for the recovery of agricultural waste have been developed, based on industrial innovation and high technology, which has contributed to guaranteeing resource efficiency, sustainable production and consumption and the reduction of negative environmental impact.

The connection between I4.0 and CE is unveiled by addressing the case-based model affecting the economic and environmental performances imparting two important dimensions: (i) the information sharing with the reverse logistics system is in real-time mode, and (ii) diffusion of green product in the market. The effectiveness of the virtual world in I4.0 environment is explored using simulation of reverse logistics model involving operations such as inventory and production planning policy, family-based dispatching rules of remanufacturing, and additive manufacturing. The remanufacturing model examines the trade-off between set-up delays and the availability of green transportation. For managerial insights, Taguchi experimental design framework has been used for the analysis. Based on the trade-off analysis between environmental and economic performances, the findings of the paper suggest appropriate combinations of information-sharing and family-based dispatching rules. Further, the findings suggest that, given the I4.0 and circular capabilities, it is necessary to focus on the cost of the socially influenced operations involving factors such as collection investment and size of the end-user market that governs the product returns. Therefore, in the present paper, the integration of I4.0 and CE represents a real-time decision model for the sustainable reverse logistics system.","[Dev, Navin K.] Dayalbagh Educ Inst, Dept Mech Engn, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Shankar, Ravi] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Management Studies, New Delhi, India; [Qaiser, Fahham Hasan] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England",Dayalbagh Educational Institute (DEI); Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi; University of Nottingham; Nottingham Trent University,"Dev, NK (corresponding author), Dayalbagh Educ Inst, Dept Mech Engn, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.",navinkumardev@yahoo.com; ravi1@dms.iitd.ac.in; fahham.qaiser@ntu.ac.uk,"Qaiser, Fahham Hasan/GXM-9078-2022; Shankar, Ravi/HSF-1169-2023","SHANKAR, RAVI/0000-0001-8724-593X; Qaiser, Fahham Hasan/0000-0002-2191-8553","University Grant Commission, New Delhi, India under UGC-UKIERI Joint Research Programme (UKIERI-III) [F.184-11/2017(IC)]","University Grant Commission, New Delhi, India under UGC-UKIERI Joint Research Programme (UKIERI-III)","One of the co-authors of this paper would like to acknowledge the funding support received through University Grant Commission, New Delhi, India.

However, research finds that consumers have a poor opinion of remanufactured products and are typically not prepared to adopt them. Thus, development of the circular economy is dependent upon deeper understanding of consumers' attitudes and behaviors. Research typically considers either micro-level or macro-level factors when assessing consumer perceptions of remanufactured products. The current research incorporates macro-level factors of price, government incentives and environmental benefits with the moderating influence of micro-level consumer attitudes to examine consumers' intention to switch from purchasing new products to remanufactured products. The findings suggest that a consumer's attitude toward remanufactured products is an important moderating factor predicting consumer switching behavior to remanufactured products.

C&DW generation has been identified as one of the major issues in the construction industry due to its direct impacts on the environment as well as the efficiency of construction industry. It is estimated that an overall of 35% of C&DW is landfilled globally, therefore, effective C&DW management is crucial in order to minimize detrimental impacts of C&DW for the environment. As the industry cannot continue to practice if the resources on which it depends are depleted, C&DW management needs to be implemented in an effective way. Despite considering many well-developed strategies for C&DW management, the outputs of the implementation of these strategies is far from optimum. The main reason of this inefficiency is due to inadequate understanding of principal factors, which play a vital role in C&DW management. Therefore, the aim of this research is to critically scrutinize the concept of C&DW and its managerial issues in a systematic way to come up with the effective C&DW management. In order to achieve this aim, and based on a systematic review of 97 research papers relevant to effective C&DW management, this research considers two main categories as fundamental factors affecting C&DW management namely, C&DW management hierarchy including reduce, reuse, and recycle strategies, and effective C&DW management contributing factors, including C&DW management from sustainability perspective, C&DW stakeholders' attitudes, C&DW project life cycle, and C&DW management tools. Subsequently, these factors are discussed in detail and findings are scrutinized in order to clarify current and future practices of C&DW management from both academic and practical perspectives.

Framed as a technologically driven and economically profitable vision of continued growth in a resource-scarce world, the CE has of late been taken up by the European Commission and global business leaders alike. However, within CE debates and documentation, little is said about the social and political implications of such transformative agendas. Whilst CE proponents claim their agenda is 'radical', this paper outlines its inability to address many deeply embedded challenges around issues of consumption and the consumer, echoing as it does the problematic (and arguably failed) agendas of sustainable consumption/lifestyles. Using the Sharing Economy as an example, we argue here that the ontological and sociological assumptions of the CE must be open to more 'radical' critique and reconsideration if this agenda is to deliver the profound transformations that its advocates claim are within our collective reach.

Case: making water tourism more sustainable,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Environment; Sustainability; Eco-costs; Product-service system; Eco-efficient value creation; Circular transition framework,EFFICIENT VALUE CREATION; SERVICES; PRODUCTS; DELIGHT; MODEL,"There is a need for metrics to analyse complex business models in the circular economy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) currently is the best defined system to analyse the environmental aspects, and is capable to analyse circular systems, Product Service Systems, and systems for recycling. However LCA falls short of analysis of the added value of business models. Since new sustainable business models are part of the transition towards a circular economy, there is a need for combined analyses of value and eco-burden. This paper applies the LCA-based Eco-costs Value Ratio (EVR) Model to analyse potential negative environmental effects of business initiatives on a system level, and to provide a theoretical approach to the design of sustainable business models by means of a three dimensional approach of costs, eco-costs and market value. Two methods are applied for analysis and design: Eco-efficient Value Creation (EVR benchmarking) and the Circular Transition Framework (describing stakeholder activities which are required for the transition towards sustainable business models). The practical case of the analysis, design and implementation of a business model for sustainable water recreation in Friesland (a province in the Netherlands) is used to validate the usefulness of these two LCA-based methods. The conclusion is that the approach of Eco-efficient Value Creation helps to avoid many pitfalls of the design of circular business models (e.g. having a positive result on product level, but having a negative effect on societal level; having a positive effect on the environment but having insufficient customer perceived value to overcome fierce market competition). The Circular Transition Framework reveals pitfalls and opportunities in implementation (e.g. the coordination between business models and governmental policies). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Then the key cross-disciplinary elements in sustainable tourism, including green energy, green transportation, green buildings, green infrastructure, green agriculture and smart technologies, are discussed. To overcome the challenges and barriers, a few implementation strategies on achieving sustainable tourism from the aspects of policy/regulation, institution, finance, technology and culture are proposed, along with the framework and details of a key performance indicator system. Finally, prospects of the potential for tourism to contribute to the transformative changes, e.g., a green economy system, are illustrated.

Aiming to boost resource exploitation efficiency, circular economy is contemplated a pertinent C&D waste management practice. However, transitioning to circular economy in C&D waste management is hindered by barriers which are to be found and overcome to adeptly handle this kind of waste. In this paper 22 potential crisp barriers are identified through reviewing the seminal literature which could be categorized under three dimensions of behavioral, technical, and legal. Six experts in behavioral, technical, and legal sciences working in sustainable C&D projects were asked to rate the dimensions and the barriers through a questionnaire survey on the results of which fuzzy TOPSIS method is applied to prioritize the barriers followed by advancing a framework to facilitate pushing C&D waste management toward circular economy. The study concluded that from behavioral, technical, and legal perspectives, using finitely recyclable construction materials; ineffective C&D wastes dismantling, sorting, transporting, and recovering processes; and using finitely recyclable construction materials are ranked first. Also from an aggregate perspective, agency and ownership issues in C&D waste management, lack of integration of sustainable C&D waste management, and uncertain aftermaths of moving toward circular economy in C&D waste management are three high priority barriers which should be removed before transforming current linear economy to circular economy in C&D waste management.","[Mahpour, Amirreza] Sharif Univ Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Construct Engn & Management Grp, Azadi Ave, Tehran, Iran",Sharif University of Technology,"Mahpour, A (corresponding author), Sharif Univ Technol, Civil Engn Dept, Construct Engn & Management Grp, Azadi Ave, Tehran, Iran.",mahpour-amirreza@alum.sharif.edu,,,,,,,45,229,237,22,162,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

However, a circular economy requires a transformation of both production and consumption systems; the standard approach for creation, fabrication, and commerce of products is challenged. Authors repeatedly call for the development of new proficiencies to attend to system transformations, but these so far have not been described for design and engineering. Given that the design of a product directly influences the way a value chain will be managed, building circular, globally sustainable value chains inevitably signifies a fundamental change in the practice of design. Comprehensive analyses were conducted on case studies from a variety of multinational enterprises that are transforming their product strategies for climate change. Changes in design processes were identified, revealing a growing necessity for industry to employ new proficiencies that support closure of material loops. This paper contributes to existing literature by depicting successful practices being implemented in industry. A variety of new capabilities are key to design for a sustainable future; these range from deeper knowledge of material composition to rich understanding of social behaviour. Resulting from this research, learning goals are proposed to serve as guidance for manufacturing companies seeking to tackle climate change. Conclusions aim to encourage researchers and academics to respond to emerging needs by re-thinking education in design and engineering. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is a remarkable difference between their rate of production and rate of recycling. At the end of their lifecycle, only a limited number of LIBs undergo any recycling treatment, with the majority go to landfills or being hoarded in households. Further losses of LIB components occur because the the state-of-the-art LIB recycling processes are limited to components with high economic value, e.g., Co, Cu, Fe, and Al. With the increasing popularity of concepts such as circular economy (CE), new LIB recycling systems have been proposed that target a wider spectrum of compounds, thus reducing the environmental impact associated with LIB production. This review work presents a discussion of the current practices and some of the most promising emerging technologies for recycling LIBs. While other authoritative reviews have focused on the description of recycling processes, the aim of the present was is to offer an analysis of recycling technologies from a CE perspective. Consequently, the discussion is based on the ability of each technology to recover every component in LIBs. The gathered data depicted a direct relationship between process complexity and the variety and usability of the recovered fractions. Indeed, only processes employing a combination of mechanical processing, and hydro- and pyrometallurgical steps seemed able to obtain materials suitable for LIB (re)manufacture. On the other hand, processes relying on pyrometallurgical steps are robust, but only capable of recovering metallic components.","[Velazquez-Martinez, Omar; Valio, Johanna; Serna-Guerrero, Rodrigo] Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, POB 16200, Aalto 0076, Finland; [Santasalo-Aarnio, Annukka] Aalto Univ, Sch Engn, Dept Mech Engn, POB 14400, Aalto 0076, Finland; [Reuter, Markus] Helmholtz Inst Freiberg Resource Technol, Chemnitzer Str 40, D-09599 Freiberg, Germany",Aalto University; Aalto University; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR),"Serna-Guerrero, R (corresponding author), Aalto Univ, Sch Chem Engn, Dept Chem & Met Engn, POB 16200, Aalto 0076, Finland.",omar.velazquezmartinez@aalto.fi; johanna.valio@pirkanmaa.fi; annukka.santasalo@aalto.fi; m.reuter@hzdr.de; rodrigo.serna@aalto.fi,"Serna-Guerrero, Rodrigo I/N-6460-2015; Santasalo-Aarnio, Annukka/E-2879-2013","Reuter, Markus A/0000-0003-0500-4863; Serna-Guerrero, Rodrigo/0000-0002-2223-142X",METYK-project - Finnish innovation agency (TEKES) [3254/31/2015]; Closing the loop for high-added value materials (CloseLoop) project - Academy of Finland [303454],METYK-project - Finnish innovation agency (TEKES); Closing the loop for high-added value materials (CloseLoop) project - Academy of Finland,"This research was funded by the METYK-project (grant number 3254/31/2015), funded by Finnish innovation agency (TEKES), as well as the Closing the loop for high-added value materials (CloseLoop) project (grant number 303454) supported by the Academy of Finland.",,122,227,235,23,160,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2313-0105,,BATTERIES-BASEL,Batteries-Basel,DEC,2019,5,4,,,,,,,68,10.3390/batteries5040068,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/batteries5040068,,,33,"Electrochemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Electrochemistry; Energy & Fuels; Materials Science,KB7AV,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000506644300005,View Full Record in Web of Science

While in the building sector issues around energy efficiency are being widely explored, CE is still a relatively new topic. This article reports on three CE pilots in the Dutch building sector and develops a collaboration tool for developing and operating circular buildings and their supply chain collaborations. First, a conceptual framework is developed to study supply chain collaboration in circular buildings, which uses theoretical building blocks for visions, actor learning, network dynamics and business model innovation. Second, a case study is presented where the framework is applied to three cases using semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Third, an empirically-based tool is developed to enhance collaboration for CE in the building sector. The cases include a newly built project, a renovation project and a demolition project. It was found that developing circular buildings requires (i) a new process design where a variety of disciplines in the supply chain is integrated upfront, (ii) the co-creation of an ambitious vision, (iii) extension of responsibilities to actors along the entire building supply chain, and (iv) new business and ownership models.

Yet, by considering mainly cost-effective opportunities within the realm of economic competitiveness, it stops short of grappling with the institutional and social predispositions necessary for societal transitions to a CE. The distinction of noncompetitive and not-for-profit activities remains to be addressed, along with other societal questions relating to labor conditions, wealth distribution, and governance systems. In this article, we recall some underlying biophysical aspects to explain the limits to current CE approaches. We examine the CE from a biophysical and social perspective to show that the concept lacks the social and institutional dimensions to address the current material and energy throughput in the economy. We show that reconsidering labor is essential to tackling the large share of dissipated material and energy flows that cannot be recovered economically. Institutional conditions have an essential role to play in setting the rules that differentiate profitable from nonprofitable activities. In this context, the social and solidarity economy, with its focus on equity with respect to labor and governance, provides an instructive and practical example that defies the constraints related to current institutional conditions and economic efficiency. We show how insights from the principles of the social and solidarity economy can contribute to the development of a CE by further defining who bears the costs of economic activities.","[Moreau, Vincent] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Coll Humanities, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Sahakian, Marlyne] Univ Lausanne, Fac Geosci & Environm, Lausanne, Switzerland; [van Griethuysen, Pascal] Un Res Inst Social Dev, Geneva, Switzerland; [Vuille, Francois] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Energy Ctr, Lausanne, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; University of Lausanne; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne,"Vuille, F (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, CEN, ENT, BAC 103,Stn 5, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.",f.vuille@epfl.ch,,"Moreau, Vincent/0000-0002-2887-3976; Sahakian, Marlyne/0000-0003-0196-7865",,,,,87,227,235,3,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

The recycling of the plastic waste can help in reducing it and its environmental threat. The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors that influence the consumer's return/recycling intention regarding plastic waste. Moreover, recycling behavior of consumer was explored in detail. The theory of planned behavior was adapted and extended to measure the determinants of recycling behavior. Survey research design was employed whereas data includes valid 243 households, collected through survey questionnaire, by employing purposive sampling. PLS-SEM was applied on the collected data for hypotheses testing. The finding of this study indicates that subjective norms, awareness consequences and convenience are major predictors of return/recycling intention. Whereas, hypothesis for the attitude, perceived behavioral control and moral norms were rejected and they all have insignificant impact on return/recycling intention. Moreover, return intention have positive significant impact on resell, reuse, dispose and donate. Reuse was the most predicted by the return intention. This study enriches the literature of reverse logistics helping to understand the consumers' perspective. Provides the insights that will help government and organizations to understand consumers' return/recycling intention and formulate such strategies that will increase the involvement of consumers in recycling activities.","[Khan, Farhana; Ahmed, Waqar; Najmi, Arsalan] IQRA Univ, Dept Management Sci, Karachi 75300, Pakistan; [Najmi, Arsalan] Univ Malaya, Fac Business & Accountancy, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Iqra University; Universiti Malaya,"Ahmed, W (corresponding author), IQRA Univ, Dept Management Sci, Karachi 75300, Pakistan.",fkfarhanakhan@gmail.com; waqar120@gmail.com; arsalan-najmi@hotmail.com,"Ahmed, Waqar/JPA-2138-2023; Najmi, Arsalan/AAP-6426-2021; Ahmed, Waqar/AGQ-9318-2022","Ahmed, Waqar/0000-0002-7003-552X; Najmi, Arsalan/0000-0003-0905-8412",,,,,71,226,235,20,209,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Currently, the increasing amount and handling of composite waste at their end-of-life (EoL) has a negative impact on resources conservation and the environment. Pyrolysis, a two-step process, appeared as most viable process to recover not only valuable materials but also produce fuel and chemicals. However, the testing facilities and optimized operation of composite waste in pyrolysis processes to produce materials with low energy consumption and acceptable mechanical properties are still under development and discussion before commercialization. The aim of this article is to review the studies on CFRC/GFRC recycling via pyrolysis processes and highlight their technical challenges and re-use possibilities in high performance composites. The forthcoming commercialization challenges and respective market potential to recyclates using the pyrolysis process will be addressed. This study will also introduce the strong connection between recycling and re-usability of fibres which would help to explain the concept of circular economy and cradle-to-cradle approach. Finally, based on updated studies and critical analysis, research gaps in the recycling treatments of fibrous composite waste using pyrolysis processes are discussed with recommendations.","[Naqvi, S.

At present, however, there is no standardized method for measuring the circularity of products. We start by reviewing existing product-level metrics in terms of validity and reliability, taking note of theoretically justified principles for aggregating different types of material flows and cycles into a single value. We then argue that the economic value of product parts may constitute a useful basis for such aggregation; describe a set of principles for using economic value as a basis for measuring product circularity; and outline a metric that utilizes this approach. Our recommendation is to use the ratio of recirculated economic value to total product value as a circularity metric, using value chain costs as an estimator. In order to protect value chain actors' sensitive financial data and facilitate neutrality regarding outsourcing or insourcing, we suggest a means to calculate product-level circularity based on sequential approximations of adding one product part and activity at a time. We conclude by suggesting potential avenues for further research, including ways in which the proposed metric can be used in wider assessments of the circular economy, and ways in which it may be further refined.","[Linder, Marcus; Sarasini, Steven; van Loon, Patricia] RISE Viktoria Sustainable Business, Lindholmspiren 3A, S-41756 Gothenburg, Sweden",RISE Research Institutes of Sweden,"Linder, M (corresponding author), RISE Viktoria Sustainable Business, Lindholmspiren 3A, S-41756 Gothenburg, Sweden.",marcus.linder@ri.se,"Sarasini, Steven/IAQ-1274-2023","Sarasini, Steven/0000-0003-4313-4538; Linder, Marcus/0000-0003-2554-2300; van Loon, Patricia/0000-0002-7894-7128",Vinnova [2014-00880],Vinnova(Vinnova),The research for this study was supported by a grant from Vinnova (No. 2014-00880).,,76,226,230,7,73,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

However, to avoid burden shifting to other resources such as Ni, circular economy strategies with enhanced battery traceability and recycling could contribute substantially to the reduction of primary Co demand from the automotive industry. The wide adoption of lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles will require increased natural resources for the automotive industry. The expected rapid increase in batteries could result in new resource challenges and supply-chain risks. To strengthen the resilience and sustainability of automotive supply chains and reduce primary resource requirements, circular economy strategies are needed. Here we illustrate how these strategies can reduce the extraction of primary raw materials, that is, cobalt supplies. Material flow analysis is applied to understand current and future flows of cobalt embedded in electric vehicle batteries across the European Union. A reference scenario is presented and compared with four strategies: technology-driven substitution and technology-driven reduction of cobalt, new business models to stimulate battery reuse/recycling and policy-driven strategy to increase recycling. We find that new technologies provide the most promising strategies to reduce the reliance on cobalt substantially but could result in burden shifting such as an increase in nickel demand. To avoid the latter, technological developments should be combined with an efficient recycling system. We conclude that more-ambitious circular economy strategies, at both government and business levels, are urgently needed to address current and future resource challenges across the supply chain successfully.","[Baars, Joris; Heidrich, Oliver] Newcastle Univ, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Domenech, Teresa; Bleischwitz, Raimund] UCL, Bartlett Sch Environm Energy & Resources, London, England; [Melin, Hans Eric] Circular Energy Storage Res & Consulting, London, England",Newcastle University - UK; University of London; University College London,"Heidrich, O (corresponding author), Newcastle Univ, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England.",Oliver.heidrich@ncl.ac.uk,"Rosa, Raquel/ACY-6683-2022; Aparisi, Teresa Domenech/AAA-6137-2020; Bleischwitz, Raimund/JJF-2415-2023","Aparisi, Teresa Domenech/0000-0002-6131-5538; Bleischwitz, Raimund/0000-0001-8164-733X; Baars, Joris/0000-0002-3222-1508; Heidrich, Oliver/0000-0002-6581-5572; Melin, Hans Eric/0000-0001-5864-0092","Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM); UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Faraday Institution [EP/S003053/1]; Recycling of Li-Ion Batteries (ReLIB) project [FIRG005]; Newcastle University; ISCF [EP/S003053/1, 2437842] Funding Source: UKRI",Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM); UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Faraday Institution(The Faraday Institution); Recycling of Li-Ion Batteries (ReLIB) project; Newcastle University; ISCF(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)),"This research was kindly supported by the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management (CIWM), the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the Faraday Institution (EP/S003053/1) and its Recycling of Li-Ion Batteries (ReLIB) project (FIRG005), and Newcastle University.

Because of the importance of the development strategy used for this purpose, an implementation framework is proposed in this paper. First, a program is suggested for practically implementing a circular economy in China to serve as a demonstration, beginning at the level of enterprises, then industrial parks, then expanding to cities and regions, thus enabling accumulation of experience to facilitate reasonable decision-making at each successive step. Legislation is also urgent. Certain issues involving legislation, for example the rules the law requires, maneuverability, public involvement, and referencing of developed countries' experiences, must be effectively addressed. Finally, a scientific and effective assessment system should be developed to obtain accurate information and improve guidance. Assessment indices should include an economic development index, a green development index, and a human development index.","[Yan Nailing] China Execut Leadership Acad, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China; [Feng Zhijun] Natl Peoples Congress Environm & Resource Commiss, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Yan, NL (corresponding author), China Execut Leadership Acad, Shanghai 201204, Peoples R China.",nlyan@celap.org.cn,,,,,,,13,223,235,2,119,SPRINGER JAPAN KK,TOKYO,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG EAST, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN",1862-4065,1862-4057,,SUSTAIN SCI,Sustain.

Here we report a class of biorenewable and degradable plastics, based on copolymers of gamma-butyrolactone and its ring- fused derivative, with competitive permeability and elongation at break compared to commodity polymers and superior mechanical and transport properties to those of most promising biobased plastics.

Based on three company case studies in the information technology and electronic industries in China, we identify and demonstrate how a blended business and environmental value can be created from adopting a sustainable supply chain management approach. The adoption of a sustainable supply chain management approach is rapidly becoming a key business challenge and opportunity in China and other large emerging economies around the world, where our greatest environmental management challenges currently reside and will continue to exist for many years to come. The value creation framework proposed in research focuses on evaluating three case study companies who appear in various stages of an electronic industry supply chain. Value creation within a supply chain can provide the impetus for organizations to adopt circular economy, sustainable supply chain practices, for competitive reasons. In addition, we describe how a value proposition can be evaluated at two levels of analysis, a more specific micro-level and a more general meso-level of analysis. The four major business value dimensions include cost reduction, revenue generation, resiliency, and legitimacy and image. The initial findings are that a variety of opportunities exist for electronic firms in emerging and developing countries, while results from this study provide an important scholarly foundation to develop and refine sustainable supply chain management practices in emerging and developing economies.

While some scholarly work has been carried out on barriers towards a circular economy, there are relatively few academic studies on policies that may accelerate a transition towards a circular economy. Those that focus on policies mostly scrutinize existing policies. The study at hand utilizes data from semi-structured interviews with 47 public and private sector circular economy experts from the European Union to explore expectations regarding circular economy policies, with expectations possibly going beyond existing policies. Expectations identified via this work include more robust standards and norms in production, expansion of circular procurement, tax relief for circular products, liberalization of waste trading and its facilitation through virtual platforms, support for eco-industrial parks, and awareness campaigns. The set of policy recommendations is presented from a life-cycle perspective that is necessary for a transition towards a circular economy. The study aims to contribute to the nascent body of circular economy literature concerning policies and may be of particular interest to practitioners.","[Hartley, Kris] Educ Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [van Santen, Ralf; Kirchherr, Julian] Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Utrecht University,"van Santen, R (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Copernicus Inst Sustainable Dev, Princetonlaan 8a, NL-3584 CB Utrecht, Netherlands.",hartley@eduhk.hk; ralfvansanten@gmail.com,"Hartley, Kris/GQP-0052-2022","Hartley, Kris/0000-0001-5349-0427",,,,,107,221,225,32,184,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

It is responsible for an estimated nine million premature deaths per year, enormous economic losses, erosion of human capital, and degradation of ecosystems. Ocean pollution is an important, but insufficiently recognized and inadequately controlled component of global pollution. It poses serious threats to human health and well-being. The nature and magnitude of these impacts are only beginning to be understood. Goals: (1) Broadly examine the known and potential impacts of ocean pollution on human health. (2) Inform policy makers, government leaders, international organizations, civil society, and the global public of these threats. (3) Propose priorities for interventions to control and prevent pollution of the seas and safeguard human health. Methods: Topic-focused reviews that examine the effects of ocean pollution on human health, identify gaps in knowledge, project future trends, and offer evidence-based guidance for effective intervention. Environmental Findings: Pollution of the oceans is widespread, worsening, and in most countries poorly controlled. It is a complex mixture of toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals, agricultural runoff, and sewage. More than 80% arises from land-based sources. It reaches the oceans through rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and direct discharges. It is often heaviest near the coasts and most highly concentrated along the coasts of low- and middle-income countries. Plastic is a rapidly increasing and highly visible component of ocean pollution, and an estimated 10 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the seas each year. Mercury is the metal pollutant of greatest concern in the oceans; it is released from two main sources - coal combustion and small-scale gold mining. Global spread of industrialized agriculture with increasing use of chemical fertilizer leads to extension of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) to previously unaffected regions. Chemical pollutants are ubiquitous and contaminate seas and marine organisms from the high Arctic to the abyssal depths. Ecosystem Findings: Ocean pollution has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, and these impacts are exacerbated by global climate change. Petroleum-based pollutants reduce photosynthesis in marine microorganisms that generate oxygen. Increasing absorption of carbon dioxide into the seas causes ocean acidification, which destroys coral reefs, impairs shellfish development, dissolves calcium-containing microorganisms at the base of the marine food web, and increases the toxicity of some pollutants. Plastic pollution threatens marine mammals, fish, and seabirds and accumulates in large mid-ocean gyres. It breaks down into microplastic and nanoplastic particles containing multiple manufactured chemicals that can enter the tissues of marine organisms, including species consumed by humans. Industrial releases, runoff, and sewage increase frequency and severity of HABs, bacterial pollution, and anti-microbial resistance. Pollution and sea surface warming are triggering poleward migration of dangerous pathogens such as the Vibrio species. Industrial discharges, pharmaceutical wastes, pesticides, and sewage contribute to global declines in fish stocks. Human Health Findings: Methylmercury and PCBs are the ocean pollutants whose human health effects are best understood. Exposures of infants in utero to these pollutants through maternal consumption of contaminated seafood can damage developing brains, reduce IQ and increase children's risks for autism, ADHD and learning disorders. Adult exposures to methylmercury increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia. Manufactured chemicals - phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, and perfluorinated chemicals, many of them released into the seas from plastic waste - can disrupt endocrine signaling, reduce male fertility, damage the nervous system, and increase risk of cancer. HABs produce potent toxins that accumulate in fish and shellfish. When ingested, these toxins can cause severe neurological impairment and rapid death. HAB toxins can also become airborne and cause respiratory disease. Pathogenic marine bacteria cause gastrointestinal diseases and deep wound infections. With climate change and increasing pollution, risk is high that Vibrio infections, including cholera, will increase in frequency and extend to new areas. All of the health impacts of ocean pollution fall disproportionately on vulnerable populations in the Global South - environmental injustice on a planetary scale. Conclusions: Ocean pollution is a global problem. It arises from multiple sources and crosses national boundaries. It is the consequence of reckless, shortsighted, and unsustainable exploitation of the earth's resources. It endangers marine ecosystems. It impedes the production of atmospheric oxygen. Its threats to human health are great and growing, but still incompletely understood. Its economic costs are only beginning to be counted. Ocean pollution can be prevented. Like all forms of pollution, ocean pollution can be controlled by deploying data-driven strategies based on law, policy, technology, and enforcement that target priority pollution sources. Many countries have used these tools to control air and water pollution and are now applying them to ocean pollution. Successes achieved to date demonstrate that broader control is feasible. Heavily polluted harbors have been cleaned, estuaries rejuvenated, and coral reefs restored. Prevention of ocean pollution creates many benefits. It boosts economies, increases tourism, helps restore fisheries, and improves human health and well-being. It advances the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These benefits will last for centuries. Recommendations: World leaders who recognize the gravity of ocean pollution, acknowledge its growing dangers, engage civil society and the global public, and take bold, evidence-based action to stop pollution at source will be critical to preventing ocean pollution and safeguarding human health. Prevention of pollution from land-based sources is key. Eliminating coal combustion and banning all uses of mercury will reduce mercury pollution. Bans on single-use plastic and better management of plastic waste reduce plastic pollution. Bans on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) have reduced pollution by PCBs and DDT. Control of industrial discharges, treatment of sewage, and reduced applications of fertilizers have mitigated coastal pollution and are reducing frequency of HABs. National, regional and international marine pollution control programs that are adequately funded and backed by strong enforcement have been shown to be effective. Robust monitoring is essential to track progress. Further interventions that hold great promise include wide-scale transition to renewable fuels; transition to a circular economy that creates little waste and focuses on equity rather than on endless growth; embracing the principles of green chemistry; and building scientific capacity in all countries. Designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) will safeguard critical ecosystems, protect vulnerable fish stocks, and enhance human health and well-being. Creation of MPAs is an important manifestation of national and international commitment to protecting the health of the seas.","[Landrigan, Philip J.; Fisher, Samantha; Judson, Bret; Mu, Jenna; Shanmugam, Hariharan; Taghian, Gabriella] Boston Coll, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA; [Stegeman, John J.; Anderson, Donald M.; Fisher, Samantha; Hahn, Mark E.] Woods Hole Oceanog Inst, Wood Hole Ctr Oceans & Human Hlth, Woods Hole, MA 02543 USA; [Fleming, Lora E.; Depledge, Michael] Univ Exeter, Med Sch, Exeter, Devon, England; [Allemand, Denis; Czerucka, Dorota; van de Water, Jeroen A.

An innovative sustainable packaging aims to address food waste and loss reduction by preserving food quality, as well as food safety issues by preventing food-borne diseases and food chemical contamination. Moreover, it must address the long-term crucial issue of environmentally persistent plastic waste accumulation as well as the saving of oil and food material resources. This paper reviews the major challenges that food packaging must tackle in the near future in order to enter the virtuous loop of circular bio-economy. Some solutions are proposed to address pressing international stakes in terms of food and plastic waste reduction and end-of-life issues of persistent materials. Among potential solutions, production of microbial biodegradable polymers from agro-food waste residues seems a promising route to create an innovative, more resilient, and productive waste-based food packaging economy by decoupling the food packaging industry from fossil feed stocks and permitting nutrients to return to the soil. To respond to the lack of tools and approach to properly design and adapt food packaging to food needs, mathematical simulation, based on modeling of mass transfer and reactions into food/packaging systems are promising tools. The next generation of such modeling and tools should help the food packaging sector to validate usage benefit of new packaging solutions and chose, in a fair and transparent way, the best packaging solution to contribute to the overall decrease of food losses and persistent plastic accumulation.","[Guillard, Valerie; Gaucel, Sebastien; Angellier-Coussy, Helene; Buche, Patrice; Gontard, Nathalie] Univ Montpellier, UMR IATE, INRA, SupAgro,CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Fornaciari, Claudio] Coopbox Grp SpA, Bibbiano, Italy",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Universite de Montpellier; INRAE; CIRAD,"Guillard, V (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier, UMR IATE, INRA, SupAgro,CIRAD, Montpellier, France.",valerie.guillard@umontpellier.fr,"GONTARD, Nathalie Georgette Jeanne/AAY-6124-2021; Gontard, Nathalie Georgette Jeanne/JZU-0744-2024; Buche, Patrice/E-1516-2011; Gaucel, Sébastien/HPD-8008-2023; Buche, Patrice/AAE-5276-2019; Angellier-Coussy, Helene/F-1635-2019","GONTARD, Nathalie Georgette Jeanne/0000-0002-8544-3139; Gaucel, Sébastien/0000-0002-8018-2291; Buche, Patrice/0000-0002-9134-5404; Angellier-Coussy, Helene/0000-0001-5482-7095",European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [773375]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [773375] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No 773375.,,75,221,225,26,175,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-861X,,,FRONT NUTR,Front.

These developments were largely triggered by environmental considerations (sustainability, resource efficiency), concerns regarding the finite and geopolitically concentrated deposits of raw phosphate ore, and phosphate price increases. Municipal wastewater is a promising and viable source to recover P in larger quantities, to re-establish a circular economy and therefore increase net use efficiency. This work compiles the latest knowledge on approaches to recover P from municipal wastewater and related waste flows with a specific focus on the existing well-developed wastewater management infrastructure, available in significant parts of Europe (e.g., secondary treated effluent, digester supernatant, sewage sludge, sewage sludge ash). About 50 technologies were identified at various levels of development (industrial-, full-, pilot- and laboratory scale). The current selection of P recovery processes is broad and ranges from simple precipitation of dissolved P to complex multi-step approaches, and only a few of these displayed potential for full-scale implementation. They are discussed with regard to their technical principles, process parameters, recovery efficiency, resource demand, possible effects on wastewater treatment, waste flows, and fate of pollutants. We also evaluated them with respect to their rates of P removal from wastewater and their access points of P recovery. For selected technologies, material flow models are presented to facilitate the understanding of even complex processes. This work serves as a basis for future integrated comparative assessments of selected recovery approaches according to technical, environmental and economic criteria. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the EU, readiness to develop a full commercial plant is becoming increasingly important given the ambitious goal to recycle all plastics by 2030. Household packaging streams tend to be of lower quality and lower recycling performance compared to industrial and commercial waste streams, thus requiring particular attention. This paper assesses chemical recycling technologies available and identifies the most suitable for recycling of household plastic waste. We identify eight different technologies and compare them in terms of process temperature, sensitivity to feedstock contamination and level of polymer breakdown, three critical factors affecting the cost and attractiveness of a chemical process. In addition, we carry out a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessment for eight technologies based on the stage of their present development. The review is based on peer-reviewed scientific papers and information collected from technology developers and providers, as well as interviews with experts. Our analysis outlines advantages and disadvantages of technologies available for chemical plastic recycling and their TRL. The chemical recycling technologies with the highest TRL are pyrolysis, catalytic cracking and conventional gasification. However, the economic feasibility of these technologies is difficult to assess due to the low number of projects in operation and scarcity of data available for comparison. The results of this analysis provide timely information as policy makers and developers set targets for recycling, and contemplate investments on research and chemical plastic recovering plants.

More recently, the research on this realm has grown rapidly, with diverse research activity covering a wide range of application areas. Considering the sustainable development goals, the innovative business models have brought a competitive advantage to improve the sustainability performance of organizations. The concept of the sustainable business model describes the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers, and captures value, in economic, social, cultural, or other contexts, in a sustainable way. The process of sustainable business model construction forms an innovative part of a business strategy. Different industries and businesses have utilized sustainable business models' concept to satisfy their economic, environmental, and social goals simultaneously. However, the success, popularity, and progress of sustainable business models in different application domains are not clear. To explore this issue, this research provides a comprehensive review of sustainable business models literature in various application areas. Notable sustainable business models are identified and further classified in fourteen unique categories, and in every category, the progress -either failure or success- has been reviewed, and the research gaps are discussed. Taxonomy of the applications includes innovation, management and marketing, entrepreneurship, energy, fashion, healthcare, agri-food, supply chain management, circular economy, developing countries, engineering, construction and real estate, mobility and transportation, and hospitality. The key contribution of this study is that it provides an insight into the state of the art of sustainable business models in various application areas and future research directions. This paper concludes that popularity and the success rate of sustainable business models in all application domains have been increased along with the increasing use of advanced technologies.","[Nosratabadi, Saeed] Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Business Studies, H-2103 Godollo, Hungary; [Mosavi, Amir] Oxford Brookes Univ, Sch Built Environm, Oxford OX3 0BP, England; [Mosavi, Amir] Obuda Univ, Inst Automat, Kando Kalman Fac Elect Engn, H-1034 Budapest, Hungary; [Mosavi, Amir; Rakotonirainy, Andry] QUT, CARRS Q, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Shamshirband, Shahaboddin] Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Inst Sustainable Construct, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Rakotonirainy, Andry] QUT, IHBI, 130 Victoria Pk Rd, Kelvin Grove, Qld 4059, Australia; [Chau, Kwok Wing] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Hung Hom, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Oxford Brookes University; Obuda University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Ton Duc Thang University; Ton Duc Thang University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Dept Management Sci & Technol Dev, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.;Shamshirband, S (corresponding author), Ton Duc Thang Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.",Saeed.Nosratabadi@phd.uni-szie.hu; amir.mosavi@kvk.uni-obuda.hu; shahaboddin.shamshirband@tdtu.edu.vn; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; r.andry@qut.edu.au; dr.kwok-wing.chau@polyu.edu.hk,"S.

In spite of its increased popularity, little is known about the implementation struggles of incumbent firms across industrial sectors. Furthermore, although the notion of circular production systems is at the intersection of different research areas such as sustainable product design, sustainable supply chains, and reverse logistics, knowledge on how these concepts combine to ease or impede firms' transition towards circularity is scarce. To shed light on these gaps, I used multiple case studies from Cradle to Cradle certified companies in the textile industry in Europe. By employing qualitative research, I identified a set of factors along the textile value chain, from product design to take-back and reprocessing, that are crucial in expediting or delaying a firm's aspirations to develop a circular product. The main contribution of this paper is the dynamic understanding of how certain collaborative supplier-buyer innovation factors (i.e., supply chain position, power balance, and a shared vision) coupled with complex aspects in product design, namely in basic materials, architecture, and functionality, combine to determine the output speed and quantity of circular products to be sold, taken back, and ultimately regenerated.

Sustainable waste management necessitates that industries shift from the current linear model to a circular based economy, utilizing wastes as raw materials for the production of new products, eg. fuels and chemicals. Biomass and associated waste materials can be converted into value-added products using thermochemical processes. The pyrolysis process is a convenient thermochemical method, whereby biomass is efficiently converted into biofuels, biochars and BBQ briquettes; and further processing yields additional value added products, such as activated carbons, carbon black and printing ink. This paper reviews current development work and evaluates potential opportunities for food waste pyrolysis focusing on the conversion of food waste to biochar products. Overall, it was found that the constituents of the food waste together with the process conditions play a major role in the yield and composition of the produced chars. Moreover, more research work needs to be conducted on food waste to biochar and on mixed food blends in particular.","[Elkhalifa, Samar; Al-Ansari, Tareq; Mackey, Hamish R.; McKay, Gordon] Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Div Sustainable Dev, Qatar Fdn, Educ City, Doha, Qatar",Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar,"McKay, G (corresponding author), Hamad Bin Khalifa Univ, Div Sustainable Dev, Qatar Fdn, Educ City, Doha, Qatar.",gmckay@hbku.edu.qa,"McKay, Gareth/HNJ-3797-2023","Al-Ansari, Tareq/0000-0002-2932-8240; McKay, Gordon/0000-0001-9965-7659; Elkhalifa, Samar/0000-0002-2534-6919",Hamad Bin Khalifa University; Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy in Qatar; Qatar Foundation,Hamad Bin Khalifa University; Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy in Qatar; Qatar Foundation(Qatar Foundation (QF)Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)),The authors would like to express their gratitude to Hamad Bin Khalifa University and Qatar Foundation for the provision of support during this project.

This is due to the high volume of CDW that is produced and its inadequate management. This situation leads to serious environmental effects, which are mainly associated with manufacturing processes for new building materials because of low product recovery rates. In this context, the concept of Circular Economy (CE) is a potential solution in many sectors, as it involves more efficient use of resources and energy, which leads to waste minimization and reduction of the environmental impacts of product cycles. Moreover, it represents potential economic opportunities. The main aim of this study was to identify factors that could influence the adoption of the Circular Economy concept in the construction and demolition sector. A systematic literature review was conducted to understand the main strategies involved in the development of integral circular strategies. The main contribution of this paper is a theoretical framework for the Circular Economy in the construction and demolition sector. The framework is comprised of 14 strategies within the five lifecycle stages of construction and demolition activities. Particularly, the framework emphasizes waste management and recirculation of recovered materials for their use as secondary building materials. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Biomass is highly significant in a circular economy in terms of material products and the provision of energy. To establish a circular bioeconomy, the practical implications of biomass use need to be appreciated by stakeholders throughout the value chain, from product design to waste management. This review addresses sustainable biomass production and its function as a feedstock from a European perspective. Anaerobic digestion of food waste is used as a case study to represent appropriate waste treatments. Crucial challenges are (1) Uncoupling the petrochemical industry and biomass production with renewable fertilisers; (2) Providing plentiful biomass for bio-based products by prioritising other renewable sources of energy; (3) Waste arising from food and agriculture must be minimised and returned to the economy; (4) Enhancing stakeholder cooperation across value chains.","[Sherwood, James] Univ York, Dept Chem, Green Chem Ctr Excellence, Heslington YO10 5DD, England",University of York - UK,"Sherwood, J (corresponding author), Univ York, Dept Chem, Green Chem Ctr Excellence, Heslington YO10 5DD, England.",james.sherwood@york.ac.uk,"Clark, James/JPK-8317-2023",,,,,,99,216,219,47,323,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-8524,1873-2976,,BIORESOURCE TECHNOL,Bioresour.

A critical component of the government's sustainability strategies concerns way in which construction and demolition waste (C&DW) is managed. In this study a mixed method approach was adopted to investigate current practices of C&DW management and circular construction (re-use, recycle and recovery of materials) concept awareness in the UK. Relevant stakeholders from the construction industry (contracting, demolition and C&DW organisations) were selected and their views solicited on arguments about circular construction to help establish common visions and further encourage sustainable behaviour across the sector. The study revealed that legislation by the government on the re-use and recycling threshold for every new project can substantially improve circularity within the built environment. More specifically, focus should be on smart dismantling of buildings and ways of optimising cost effective processes. This will enable fair competition between stakeholders and eventually lead to investments in innovative approaches for resource recovery from C&DW. Further incentives and appreciations from government should also be given to stakeholders who are innovating and setting benchmarks in circular construction. This can lead to harmonised technological and non-technological solutions, closed-loop material processes and a circular economy.

E-waste is one of the fastest growing waste streams, and threatens to grow into a global problem of unmanageable proportions. An effective form of management of resource recycling and environmental improvement is available, in the form of extraction and purification of precious metals taken E from waste streams, in a process known as urban mining. In this work, we demonstrate utilizing real cost data from e-waste processors in China that ingots of pure copper and gold could be recovered from e-waste streams at costs that are comparable to those encountered in virgin mining of ores. Our results are confined to the cases of copper and gold extracted and processed from e-waste streams made up of recycled TV sets, but these results indicate a trend and potential if applied across a broader range of e-waste sources and metals extracted. If these results can be extended to other metals and countries, they promise to have positive impact on waste disposal and mining activities globally, as the circular economy comes to displace linear economic pathways.","[Zeng, Xianlai; Li, Jinhui] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Mathews, John A.] Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Grad Sch Management, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Tsinghua University; Macquarie University,"Li, JH (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Mathews, JA (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Macquarie Grad Sch Management, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",john.mathews@mgsm.edu.au; jinhui@tsinghua.edu.cn,"Zeng, Xianlai/J-9753-2019; Zeng, Xianlai/HGU-9273-2022","Zeng, Xianlai/0000-0001-5563-6098; Zeng, Xianlai/0000-0001-5563-6098; Mathews, John/0000-0002-4380-7563",Major Research Plan of National Social Science Foundation of China [16ZDA071],Major Research Plan of National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),The work is financially supported by Major Research Plan of National Social Science Foundation of China (16ZDA071).

Despite the many benefits of plastics, the global plastic system is increasingly being recognized as the source of severe environmental problems. Rather than orient the investigation around specific venues, levels, or architectures of governance, our survey first follows plastic through its life cycle, and then considers the major categories of plastic objects addressed in the current literature, and the different approaches taken to each category. The politics of plastics is a growing field of inquiry, with the most rapid expansion in the areas of marine pollution and microplastics. Our consideration of plastic flows reveals increasing politicization towards the latter end of the life cycle, that is, plastic as waste and pollution. Turning to plastic objects, we observe different forms of mobilization, and varying connections between flows and objects, which allow for multiple interpretations of what is at stake. In the closing section, we consider two recent trends in the plastic governance discussion that take a more holistic view of the plastic crisis: attempts to construct (a) a circular plastics economy and (b) global plastics conventions or treaties. We end the paper by highlighting the need for studies to further investigate the norms and practices that maintain the role of plastics in society, as well as the political and economic arrangements that secure its overabundance and low price.","[Nielsen, Tobias D.; Hasselbalch, Jacob; Holmberg, Karl; Stripple, Johannes] Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Nielsen, TD (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Lund, Sweden.",tobias.nielsen@svet.lu.se,,"Holmberg, Karl/0000-0001-8444-4466; Hasselbalch, Jacob Adam/0000-0001-5491-7023",H2020 Environment [730053]; Kamprad Foundation; Stiftelsen for Miljostrategisk Forskning [2016/1489]; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research,H2020 Environment(Horizon 2020); Kamprad Foundation; Stiftelsen for Miljostrategisk Forskning; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research(Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research),"H2020 Environment, Grant/Award Number: 730053; Kamprad Foundation, Grant/Award Number: SUSPLAST; Stiftelsen for Miljostrategisk Forskning, Grant/Award Number: No. 2016/1489; Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research",,132,215,233,33,215,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",2041-8396,2041-840X,,WIRES ENERGY ENVIRON,Wiley Interdiscip.

Almost all existing techniques evaluate resource use based on their burden relative to value, while the central point of Circular Economy is to create value through material retention. The existing burden-orientated techniques are therefore unsuitable for guiding managers in relation to Circular Economy objectives. This paper presents a new performance metric, the longevity indicator, which measures contribution to material retention based on the amount of time a resource is kept in use. The measure is composed of three generic components: initial lifetime, earned refurbished lifetime and earned recycled lifetime. Management of these components can be used for decision making and performance assessment in the Circular Economy. The example of precious metals in mobile phone handsets is used to illustrate the general application and suitability of this indicator. Findings show that for materials to be retained, managers should encourage longer lifetime use, increase product return levels for initial use and refurbished phones, and select the most effective recycling processes available. This paper advances performance indicators for Circular Economy, and provides a tool which can be applied at managerial and organizational levels to measure the impact of business decisions on the longevity of precious materials.

For this purpose, repair and remanufacturing are highly considered as proper techniques to return the value of the product during its life. Directed Energy Deposition (DED) is a very flexible type of additive manufacturing (AM), and among the AM techniques, it is most suitable for repairing and remanufacturing automotive and aerospace components. Its application allows damaged component to be repaired, and material lost in service to be replaced to restore the part to its original shape. In the past, tungsten inert gas welding was used as the main repair method. However, its heat affected zone is larger, and the quality is inferior. In comparison with the conventional welding processes, repair via DED has more advantages, including lower heat input, warpage and distortion, higher cooling rate, lower dilution rate, excellent metallurgical bonding between the deposited layers, high precision, and suitability for full automation. Hence, the proposed repairing method based on DED appears to be a capable method of repairing. Therefore, the focus of this study was to present an overview of the DED process and its role in the repairing of metallic components. The outcomes of this study confirm the significant capability of DED process as a repair and remanufacturing technology.","[Saboori, Abdollah; Aversa, Alberta; Marchese, Giulio; Biamino, Sara; Lombardi, Mariangela; Fino, Paolo] Politecn Torino, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin,"Saboori, A (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, Dept Appl Sci & Technol, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",abdollah.saboori@polito.it,"Saboori, Abdollah/N-2634-2016; Aversa, Alberta/AAM-5669-2020; Lombardi, Mariangela/G-7953-2012","Saboori, Abdollah/0000-0001-7135-1316; Lombardi, Mariangela/0000-0002-1546-8525; Biamino, Sara/0000-0003-1840-7717; Aversa, Alberta/0000-0002-0347-4821",Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [723795]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [723795] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme,Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(Horizon 2020); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),This research was funded by Horizon 2020 research and innovation program with grant number [723795].,,100,214,233,56,321,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3417,,APPL SCI-BASEL,Appl.

In this article, we extend the state-of-the-art literature on CE business models through the inclusion of the 'human side' of such issues. This goal is met by offering an original integrative GHRM framework for organizations developing CE. The theoretical lenses of stakeholders' theory and the resource based view (RBV) form the foundation of this framework, which represents a 'middle range theory'. We underline the practices and dimensions of the links between GHRM and the 'ReSOLVE' CE model.

However, despite the individual prominence of the Circular Economy and Sustainable Development in the academic and wider literature, the exact relationship between the two concepts has neither been thoroughly defined nor explored. The consequent result is various inconsistencies occurring across the literature regarding how the Circular Economy can serve as a tool for Sustainable Development and an incomplete understanding of how its long-term effects differ from those of the linear economy. A literature review was conducted to interpret the current conceptual relationship between the Circular Economy and Sustainable Development. The review highlights numerous challenges concerning conceptual definition, economic growth and implementation that inhibit the use of the Circular Economy as a tool for Sustainable Development in its current form. The review concludes by providing suggestions for how research concerning the Circular Economy should proceed if it is to provide a potential approach for achieving Sustainable Development.","[Millar, Neal; McLaughlin, Eoin; Borger, Tobias] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Millar, N (corresponding author), Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",millar.neal@gmail.com,"McLaughlin, Eoin/ABA-2401-2021","Millar, Neal/0000-0001-5287-0049; McLaughlin, Eoin/0000-0002-0307-3374",,,,,84,213,220,33,321,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-8009,1873-6106,,ECOL ECON,Ecol.

Cutting-edge technologies such as big data and internet of things (IoT) have the potential to leverage the adoption of CE concepts by organizations and society, becoming more present in our daily lives. Therefore, it is fundamentally important for researchers interested in this subject to understand the status quo of studies being undertaken worldwide and to have the overall picture of it. We conducted a bibliometric literature review from the Scopus Database over the period of 2006-2015 focusing on the application of big data/IoT on the context of CE. This produced the combination of 30,557 CE documents with 32,550 unique big data/IoT studies resulting in 70 matching publications that went through content and social network analysis with the use of 'R' statistical tool. We then compared it to some current industry initiatives. Bibliometrics findings indicate China and USA are the most interested countries in the area and reveal a context with significant opportunities for research. In addition, large producers of greenhouse gas emissions, such as Brazil and Russia, still lack studies in the area. Also, a disconnection between important industry initiatives and scientific research seems to exist. The results can be useful for institutions and researchers worldwide to understand potential research gaps and to focus future investments/studies in the field.","[Nobre, Gustavo Cattelan; Tavares, Elaine] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPEAD Grad Business Sch, Rua Pascoal Lemme 355,Cidade Univ, BR-21941918 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Nobre, GC (corresponding author), Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, COPPEAD Grad Business Sch, Rua Pascoal Lemme 355,Cidade Univ, BR-21941918 Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",gustavo.nobre@coppead.ufrj.br; elaine.tavares@coppead.ufrj.br,"Tavares, Elaine/Q-4680-2018; Nobre, Gustavo Cattelan/V-7570-2019","Nobre, Gustavo Cattelan/0000-0002-0175-060X; Tavares, Elaine/0000-0002-1107-2101",,,,,77,213,217,21,333,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0138-9130,1588-2861,,SCIENTOMETRICS,Scientometrics,APR,2017,111,1,,,,,463,492,,10.1007/s11192-017-2281-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-017-2281-6,,,30,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science,ER4LH,,,Y,N,2024-04-26,WOS:000398770700026,View Full Record in Web of Science

The conventional fossil fuels are unable to satiate this requirement causing price inflation and significant environmental damage due to unrestrained emission of greenhouse gases. The focus now has shifted towards alternative, economical, renewable and green sources of energy such as hydrogen to deal with this bottleneck. Hydrogen is a clean energy-source having high energy content (122 kJ/g). Recently, biological methods for the hydrogen production have attracted much attention because traditional methods are expensive, energy-exhaustive and not eco-friendly. The employment of biological methods promises utilization of waste or low-value materials for producing energy and building waste-to-energy nexus. Around 94% of the waste is discarded precariously in India and waste generation is growing at an alarming rate of 13% per year. The waste-to-energy techniques follow 'Reuse, Reduce, Recycle, Recovery and Reclamation' system solving three subjects at once; waste-management, energy-demand and environmental concern. Moreover, these methods have easy operability, cost-effectiveness and they help to shift from linear to circular model of economy for sustainable development. Biological processing of waste materials like agricultural discard (lignocellulosic biomass), food-waste and industrial discharge can be used for biohydrogen production. Dark and photo fermentation are the chief biological processes for the transformation of organic substrates to hydrogen. Dark fermentation is the acidogenic fermentation of carbohydrate-rich materials without light and oxygen. Clostridia, Enterobacter and Bacillus spp. are appropriate heterotrophic bacteria for dark fermentation. Various pretreatment methods like heat treatment, acid or base treatment ultrasonication, aeration, electroporation, etc., can be applied on inoculums to increase H-2 producing bacteria eventually improving the hydrogen yield. However, only around 33% of COD in organic materials is transformed to H-2 by this method. Photofermentation by the photosynthetic non-sulfur bacteria (PNS) converts organic substrate to H-2 and CO2 in the presence of nitrogenase enzyme in ammonium-limited and anoxygenic conditions. Rhodobacter or Rhodopseudomonas strains have been widely examined in this regard. But these methods are only able to produce H-2 with a poor yield. Combining dark and photofermentation is a noteworthy alternative for procuring enhanced hydrogen yields. Two-stage sequential method utilizes volatile fatty adds accumulated as byproducts after dark fermentation ( in the first stage) for photofermentation by suitable bacteria (in the second stage). A proper investigation of the dark fermenter effluents is required before using them as a substrate for photo-fermentation. In a single-stage dark and photofermentation, co-culture of anaerobic and PNS bacteria in a single reactor is carried out for obtaining improved yield. The single stage system is comparatively inexpensive and less laborious; moreover, a limited requirement for an intermediate dilution stage is necessary. Economic analysis of hydrogen production showed that H-2 production by the present methods, save pyrolysis, is reasonably higher than the conventional approaches of fuel production. Probable routes to make H-2 production more cost-effective are reducing the cost of photobioreactor. installing proper storage system. etc. A constructive effort in the area of research and development of biological approaches of H-2 production technologies is vital. The commercial viability of biohydrogen production is imperative for accomplishment of circular economy system and sustainable development. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Among these minor components, phenolics are relevant molecules for human health. This review is focused on their beneficial activity, in particular of hydroxytyrosol (HT), oleuropein (OLE), oleocanthal (OLC), and lignans found in EVOO, olive oil by-products and leaves. Specifically, the cardioprotective properties of the Mediterranean diet (MD) related to olive oil consumption, and the biological activities of polyphenols recovered from olive oil by-products and leaves were described. Recent European projects such as EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) and EPICOR (long-term follow-up of antithrombotic management patterns in acute coronary syndrome patients) have demonstrated the functional and preventive activities of EVOO showing the relation both between cancer and nutrition and between consumption of EVOO, vegetables, and fruit and the incidence of coronary heart disease. The data reported in this review demonstrate that EVOO, one of the pillars of the MD, is the main product of Olea europaea L. fruits; leaves and by-products are secondary but precious products from which bioactive compounds can be recovered by green technologies and reused for food, agronomic, nutraceutical, and biomedical applications according to the circular economy strategy.","[Romani, Annalisa; Ieri, Francesca; Urciuoli, Silvia] Univ Florence, PHYTOLAB Pharmaceut Cosmet Food Supplement Techno, Via U Schiff 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy; [Noce, Annalisa; Marrone, Giulia] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, UOC Internal Med, Ctr Hypertens, Via Montpellier 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Noce, Annalisa; Marrone, Giulia] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Nephrol Unit, Dept Syst Med, Via Montpellier 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Marrone, Giulia] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, PhD Sch Appl Med, Surg Sci, Via Montpellier 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Nediani, Chiara] Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Biomed Sci Mario Serio, Viale Morgagni 50, I-50134 Florence, Italy; [Bernini, Roberta] Univ Tuscia, Dept Agr & Forest Sci DAFNE, Via San Camillo de Lellis, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy",University of Florence; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Florence; Tuscia University,"Romani, A (corresponding author), Univ Florence, PHYTOLAB Pharmaceut Cosmet Food Supplement Techno, Via U Schiff 6, I-50019 Sesto Fiorentino, Italy.;Noce, A (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, UOC Internal Med, Ctr Hypertens, Via Montpellier 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",annalisa.romani@unifi.it; annalisa.noce@uniroma2.it,"Nediani, Chiara/AAO-8919-2020; Marrone, Giulia/IQR-7760-2023","Nediani, Chiara/0000-0003-3190-3539; Marrone, Giulia/0000-0002-5854-2086; Ieri, Francesca/0000-0002-5655-629X; URCIUOLI, SILVIA/0000-0001-8139-3229; NOCE, ANNALISA/0000-0003-1310-3730; BERNINI, Roberta/0000-0002-2548-3876",Ministero delle Politiche Agricole e Forestali-MIPAF [30311]; Federazione Medico Sportiva Italiana,Ministero delle Politiche Agricole e Forestali-MIPAF; Federazione Medico Sportiva Italiana,"The authors thank EXTRANUTRAOILS Project (DM n.30311, October 31st 2018, Ministero delle Politiche Agricole e Forestali-MIPAF) and Federazione Medico Sportiva Italiana for financial support; Caterina Gola for the revision of the English language.",,127,212,216,12,131,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-6643,,NUTRIENTS,Nutrients,AUG,2019,11,8,,,,,,,1776,10.3390/nu11081776,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu11081776,,,33,Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Nutrition & Dietetics,IV8HH,31374907,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",Y,N,2024-04-26,WOS:000484506000027,View Full Record in Web of Science

Only 600 urban areas with just 20 % of the world population generate 60 % of the GWP. Rapid urbanization, climate change, inadequate maintenance of water and wastewater infrastructures and poor solid waste management may lead to flooding, water scarcity, water pollution, adverse health effects and rehabilitation costs that may overwhelm the resilience of cities. These megatrends pose urgent challenges in cities as the cost of inaction is high. We present an overview about population growth, urbanization, water, waste, climate change, water governance and transitions. Against this background, we discuss the categorization of cities based on our baseline assessments, i.e. our City Blueprint research on 45 municipalities and regions predominantly in Europe. With this bias towards Europe in mind, the challenges can be discussed globally by clustering cities into distinct categories of sustainability and by providing additional data and information from global regions. We distinguish five categories of sustainability: (1) cities lacking basic water services, (2) wasteful cities, (3) water-efficient cities, (4) resource-efficient and adaptive cities and (5) water-wise cities. Many cities in Western Europe belong to categories 3 and 4. Some cities in Eastern Europe and the few cities we have assessed in Latin America, Asia and Africa can be categorized as cities lacking basic water services. Lack of water infrastructures or obsolete infrastructures, solid waste management and climate adaptation are priorities. It is concluded that cities require a long-term framing of their sectoral challenges into a proactive and coherent Urban Agenda to maximize the co-benefits of adaptation and to minimize the cost. Furthermore, regional platforms of cities are needed to enhance city-to-city learning and to improve governance capacities necessary to accelerate effective and efficient transitions towards water-wise cities. These learning alliances are needed as the time window to solve the global water governance crisis is narrow and rapidly closing. The water sector can play an important role but needs to reframe and refocus radically.","[Koop, S. H. A.; van Leeuwen, C.

As such, mushroom-forming fungi convert low-quality waste streams into high-quality food. Spent mushroom substrate (SMS) is usually considered a waste product. This review discusses the applications of SMS to promote the transition to a circular economy. SMS can be used as compost, as a substrate for other mushroom-forming fungi, as animal feed, to promote health of animals, and to produce packaging and construction materials, biofuels, and enzymes. This range of applications can make agricultural production more sustainable and efficient, especially if the CO2 emission and heat from mushroom cultivation can be used to promote plant growth in greenhouses.","[Grimm, Daniel; Wosten, Han A.

These technicalities determine the ability of materials, components and products (MCPs) to be properly recovered and redistributed for reuse, recycling or recovery, given their remaining functionality, described here as the remaining properties and characteristics of MCPs. The different properties of MCPs make them useful for various functions and purposes. A transition, therefore, towards a CE would require the utmost exploitation of the remaining functionality of MCPs; ideally, enabling recirculation of them back in the economy. At present, this is difficult to succeed. This short communication article explains how the remaining functionality of MCPs, defined here as quality, is perceived at different stages of the supply chain, focusing specifically on plastic packaging, and how this affects their potential recycling. It then outlines the opportunities and constraints posed by some of the interventions that are currently introduced into the plastic packaging system, aimed at improving,- plastic materials circularity. Finally, the article underpins the need for research that integrates systemic thinking, with technological innovations and policy reforms al all stages of the supply chain, to promote sustainable practices become established.

The identities of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) responsible for the establishment and function of biofilms are poorly understood. The lack of information on the chemical and physical identities of EPS limits the potential to rationally engineer biofilm processes, and impedes progress within the water and wastewater sector towards a circular economy and resource recovery. Here, a multidisciplinary roadmap for addressing this EPS identity crisis is proposed. This involves improved EPS extraction and characterization methodologies, cross-referencing between model biofilms and full-scale biofilm systems, and functional description of isolated EPS with in situ techniques (e.g. microscopy) coupled with genomics, proteomics and glycomics. The current extraction and spectrophotometric characterization methods, often based on the principle not to compromise the integrity of the microbial cells, should be critically assessed, and more comprehensive methods for recovery and characterization of EPS need to be developed.

Built on an integrative review of the literature, this study offers insights into the potential of smart cities and connected communities in facilitating waste management efforts. Shortcomings of existing waste management practices are highlighted and a conceptual framework for a centralized waste management system is proposed, where three interconnected elements are discussed: (1) an infrastructure for proper collection of product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibility throughout the entire lifespan of a product, (2) a set of new business models relied on product lifecycle data to prevent waste generation, and (3) an intelligent sensor-based infrastructure for proper upstream waste separation and on-time collection. The proposed framework highlights the value of product lifecycle data in reducing waste and enhancing waste recovery and the need for connecting waste management practices to the whole product life cycle. An example of the use of tracking and data sharing technologies for investigating the waste management issues has been discussed. Finally, the success factors for implementing the proposed framework and some thoughts on future research directions have been discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the important end-of-life (EOL) products considered in the RL/CLSC is Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)/E-waste. Numerous research papers were published in the RL and CLSC disciplines focusing WEEE separately. However, there is no single review article found on the product-specific issues. To bridge this gap, a total of 157 papers published between 1999 and May 2017 were selected, categorized, analyzed using content analysis method. The method involves four steps: material collection, descriptive analysis, category selection and material evaluation. For the systematic literature review, the steps were followed and four main types of research in the field of RL and CLSC of E-waste, namely designing and planning of reverse distribution, decision making and performance evaluation, conceptual framework, and qualitative studies were identified and reviewed. Research gaps in literature were diagnosed to suggest future research opportunities. The review first of its kind that may provide a useful reference for academicians, researchers and industry practitioners for a better understanding of WEEE focused RL/CLSC activities and research.","[Islam, Md Tasbirul; Huda, Nazmul] Macquarie Univ, Sch Engn, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Islam, MT; Huda, N (corresponding author), Macquarie Univ, Sch Engn, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",md-tasbirul.islam@hdr.mq.edu.au; nazmul.huda@mq.edu.au,"Islam, Md Tasbirul/AFL-3493-2022; Huda, Nazmul/AAI-4807-2020","Islam, Md Tasbirul/0000-0002-6323-2795; Huda, Nazmul/0000-0002-2349-7019",Macquarie University under the scholarship scheme International Macquarie University Research Training Program (iMQRTP),Macquarie University under the scholarship scheme International Macquarie University Research Training Program (iMQRTP),The authors would like to thank Dr Keith Imrie for proof-reading this paper.

As urban populations swell across the planet, cities are faced with increasing pressure on infrastructure, economic and ecological systems. Yet, with their high population densities and ubiquity of information and communication technologies, cities are becoming breeding grounds for a new, circular economy driven by emerging and long-standing sharing activities. This research provides a comprehensive view of SCP systems in cities by integrating and examining sharing economy activities in the context of two continuums, i.e. SCP and private/public orientation. Based on these two analytical dimensions, the paper evaluates and plots five groups of 18 sharing activities to create a Sharing Cities-SCP Typology comprised by five ideal types. Each of these five types represents a unique form of SCP activity, with the potential to directly impact SCP systems in the context of urban environments. By enabling diversity and hybridity in the SCP analysis, we allow for a theoretical expansion of SCP models and a new way of understanding how they may play out in cities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In reality, however, many economies are producing more and more waste, which poses a serious challenge to environmental sustainability. The problem is enormously complex as it involves a variety of stakeholders, demands behavioral changes, and requires a complete rethinking of the current waste management systems and the dominant linear economic model. Smart enabling technologies can aid in a transformation of waste management toward a circular economy, but many barriers persist. This study first shortlists twelve important barriers to smart waste management in China based on interviews with experienced practitioners. It then prioritizes these barriers through a scientific prioritization technique, fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), based on the survey data from three representative stakeholders. It identified three key causal barriers: the lack of regulatory pressures, the lack of environmental education and culture of environmental protection, and the lack of market pressures and demands. Practical and theoretical implications were discussed based on the research results and findings. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Transition towards a CE is underway, therefore, understanding the nature and state of this transition is important for creating effective policies and business strategies. Some studies have focused on specific contexts and pockets of good practice. This exploratory, survey-based study of 77 companies investigates the shift towards the CE using a taxonomy of practices and barriers. Results show that firms favour practices related to resource and energy utilisation efficiency, while practices related to investment recovery, green purchasing and customer cooperation are less prevalent. Eco-design and internal environmental management practices have a medium level of implementation. The significant upfront investment cost, lack of awareness or sense of urgency were identified as implementation barriers. Results suggest the CE is driven by economic not environmental considerations, and the deployment of practices remains within a firm rather than across the supply chain.","[Masi, Donato; Godsell, Janet] Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Kumar, Vikas] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Operat & Supply Chain Management, Bristol, Avon, England; [Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo] Univ Derby, Ctr Supply Chain Improvement, Derby, England",University of Warwick; University of West England; University of Derby,"Masi, D (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",donato.masi@warwick.ac.uk,"Kumar, Vikas/E-3272-2018; Reyes, José Antonio Reyes/GXZ-6957-2022; Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo/ABD-5164-2021","Kumar, Vikas/0000-0002-8062-7123; Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo/0000-0002-5493-877X; Masi, Donato/0000-0002-4553-3244",,,,,65,203,206,7,103,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-7287,1366-5871,,PROD PLAN CONTROL,Prod.

Given the socio-ecological challenges of the Anthropocene, the concept of CE could indeed help the transition to a sustainable, just and resilient future. However, the actual definition, objectives and forms of implementation of the CE are still unclear, inconsistent, and contested. Different actors and sectors are thus articulating circular discourses which align with their interests, and which often do not sufficiently examine the ecological, social and political implications of circularity. In this context, this research asks how to better navigate and analyse the history, complexity and plurality of circularity discourses by conceptually differentiating them in a comprehensive discourse typology. To answer this question a critical literature review has been carried out, which first, examines and reflects on the core challenges, gaps and limitations of the CE concept. Second, this research develops a comprehensive timeline of circularity thinking, which identifies and conceptually classifies 72 different CE-related concepts from the Global North and South (such as Gandhian and steady-state economics, buen vivir, doughnut economics and degrowth). This leads to the development of a typology of circularity discourses, which classifies circularity visions according to their position on fundamental social, technological, political and ecological issues. This research thus seeks to provide a basis for a more inclusive and comprehensive discussion on the topic, which opens the imaginary regarding the many circular futures that can exist and allows for a cross-pollination of ideas, policy options, strategies, practices and solutions.","[Friant, Martin Calisto; Vermeulen, Walter J.

At first, we developed a new categorizing system for GCP dividing to (i) pollution and accident prevention, (ii) safety and resource sustainability, and (iii) energy and resource sustainability. To assess the GCP practice towards the circular economy, the implementation of international movement of GCP in worldwide policy, especially those of Canada, China, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Sweden, Taiwan, United States and United Kingdom were reviewed. The policy implementation of GCP practices among governance, industries and education was analyzed. To integrate GCP into the circular economy concept, we also proposed five strategies of priority governance direction as follows: (i) establishment of cross-departmental collaboration, (ii) development of cleaner production and green product, (iii) provision of integrated chemical management system, (iv) implementation of green chemistry education program, and (v) construction of a business model.

In the food sector, despite the fact that valuable natural resources are intensively used to produce and distribute food products, little is done to upcycle residues generated along the supply chain. Circular economy strategies are crucial for restructuring the take-make-dispose model through the active participation of all actors of supply chains. However, little is known about consumers' willingness to participate in circular economy. A structured questionnaire was submitted to a representative sample of Italian households to assess the willingness of consumers to be actively involved in closed loops aiming at reducing food waste. Consumers are involved by returning their organic food waste to retailers in exchange for discounts on the purchase of animal products. The organic food waste returned enters in the production process of animal products. A choice experiment was designed to analyse alternative programs. Two scenarios were presented: one with a traditional technology (composting), and a second one with a radically innovative technology (insects as feed). Preferences and trade-offs, in monetary terms, among attributes were computed. Results depict a comprehensive portrait of the potential participation of consumers to closed loops inspired by the principles of circular economy.","[Borrello, Massimiliano; Caracciolo, Francesco; Lombardi, Alessia; Cembalo, Luigi] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Agr Sci, Via Univ 100, I-80055 Portici, Italy; [Pascucci, Stefano] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Penryn Campus,G16 SERSF Bldg, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England",University of Naples Federico II; University of Exeter,"Pascucci, S (corresponding author), Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Penryn Campus,G16 SERSF Bldg, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England.",massimiliano.borrello@unina.it; francesco.caracciolo@unina.it; alessia.lombardi@unina.it; s.pascucci@exeter.ac.uk; cembalo@unina.it,"Caracciolo, Francesco/D-6147-2013; Borrello, Massimiliano/AAS-3220-2020","Caracciolo, Francesco/0000-0001-9430-7529; Borrello, Massimiliano/0000-0003-1508-713X; Lombardi, Alessia/0000-0002-5862-0283; Cembalo, Luigi/0000-0002-3808-5797",,,,,57,201,207,6,150,MDPI AG,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JAN,2017,9,1,,,,,,,141,10.3390/su9010141,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9010141,,,18,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EL8AO,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000394842700139,View Full Record in Web of Science

The packaging industry is the largest and growing consumer of synthetic plastics derived from fossil fuels. Food packaging plastics account for the bulk of plastic waste that are polluting the environment. Additionally, given the fact that petroleum reserves are finite and facing depletion, there is a need for the development of alternative materials that can serve the same purpose as conventional plastics. This paper reviews the function of packaging materials and highlights the future potential of the adoption of green materials. Biopolymers have emerged as promising green materials although they still have very low market uptake. Polylactic acid (PLA) has emerged as the most favoured bioplastic. However, it is limited by its high cost and some performance drawbacks. Blending with agricultural waste and natural fillers can result in green composites at low cost, low greenhouse gas emissions, and with improved performance for food packaging applications. The continent of Africa is proposed as a rich source of fibres and fillers that can be sustainably exploited to fabricate green composites in a bid to achieve a circular economy.","[Ncube, Lindani Koketso; Ude, Albert Uchenna] Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol BIUST, Fac Engn & Technol FET, Dept Mech Energy & Ind Engn, Private Mail Bag 16, Palapye, Botswana; [Ogunmuyiwa, Enoch Nifise] BIUST, Dept Chem Mat & Met Engn Acad, FET, Private Mail Bag 16, Palapye, Botswana; [Zulkifli, Rozli] Natl Univ Malaysia, Fac Engn & Built Environm, Dept Mech & Mat Engn, UKM, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Beas, Isaac Nongwe] Botswana Inst Technol Res & Innovat BITRI, Private Bag 0082, Gaborone, Botswana",,"Ude, AU (corresponding author), Botswana Int Univ Sci & Technol BIUST, Fac Engn & Technol FET, Dept Mech Energy & Ind Engn, Private Mail Bag 16, Palapye, Botswana.",nl19100062@studentmail.biust.ac.bw; udea@biust.ac.bw; ogunmuyiwae@biust.ac.bw; rozlizulkifli@ukm.edu.my; ibeas@bitri.co.bw,"Beas, Isaac N./JCF-1130-2023; Ogunmuyiwa, Enoch/ABA-6792-2021; Zulkifli, Rozli/Q-1570-2017","Beas, Isaac N./0000-0002-8636-7895; Ogunmuyiwa, Enoch/0000-0002-3537-661X; Zulkifli, Rozli/0000-0002-4125-6163; Ude, Albert Uchenna/0000-0003-2781-2335; Ncube, Lindani/0000-0001-6697-4172","Botswana International University of Science and Technology [0073, 0073] Funding Source: Medline",Botswana International University of Science and Technology,,,134,200,201,47,231,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1996-1944,,MATERIALS,Materials,NOV,2020,13,21,,,,,,,4994,10.3390/ma13214994,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma13214994,,,24,"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics,OR3GW,33171895,"gold, Green Published",Y,N,2024-04-26,WOS:000589363100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The construction and demolition waste has been correspondingly increased enormously which results in nasty and fatal impacts on urban sustainability and survival in the term of economic values and environmental safety. Considering construction and demolition waste management (CDWM) in the USA and China and its comparison has not been discussed, this study explores some research questions to fill such gaps: What are the existing CDWM policies and regulations in these two countries? What is the market mode for CDWM? What are the key challenges of CDWM? What are the CDWM contribution and limitations toward circular economy? What are the lessons that must be exemplary for the two economies through mutual learning? Our results show that the CD waste generation and its management are influenced by several factors including population, urbanization, gross domestic product (GDP), and CDWM regulatory measures. The USA has more developed CDWM system. Whereas, China is a growing economy and it has some management deficiencies in the construction industry. Key suggestions for improving CDWM include: i. Government supervision along with an economic incentive approach, ii. Interaction between Stakeholders, iii. Mutual coordination among operational departments, iv. Audit and inspection setup, and v.

In 2016, the global amount of e-waste reached an all-time high of 44.7 million tons. E-waste is an invaluable unconventional resource due to its high metal content, as nearly 40% of e-waste is comprised of metals. Unfortunately, the rapid growth of e-waste is alarming due to severe environmental impacts and challenges associated with complex resource recovery that has led to the use of toxic chemicals. Furthermore, there is a very unfortunate ethical issue related to the flow of e-wastes from developed countries to developing countries. At this time, e-waste is often open pit burned and toxic chemicals are used without adequate regulations to recover metals such as copper. The recovered metals are eventually exported back to the developed countries. Thus, the current global circular economy of e-waste is not sustainable in terms of environmental impact as well as creation of ethical dilemmas. Although traditional metallurgical processes can be extended to e-waste treatment technologies, that is not enough. The complexity of e-waste requires the development of a new generation of metallurgical processes that can separate and extract metals from unconventional components such as polymers and a wide range of metals. This review focuses on the science and engineering of both conventional and innovative separation and recovery technologies for e-wastes with special attention being given to the overall sustainability. Physical separation processes, including disassembly, density separation, and magnetic separation, as well as thermal treatment of the polymeric component, such as pyrolysis, are discussed for the separation of metals and non-metals from e-wastes. The subsequent metal recovery processes through pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and biometallurgy are also discussed in depth. Finally, insights on future research towards sustainable treatment and recovery of e-waste are presented including the use of supercritical CO2.","[Hsu, Emily; West, Alan C.; Park, Ah-Hyung A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Chem Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Hsu, Emily; Barmak, Katayun; West, Alan C.; Park, Ah-Hyung A.] Columbia Univ, Lenfest Ctr Sustainable Energy, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Barmak, Katayun] Columbia Univ, Dept Appl Phys & Appl Math Mat Sci & Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA; [West, Alan C.; Park, Ah-Hyung A.] Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University,"Park, AHA (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Chem Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Park, AHA (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Lenfest Ctr Sustainable Energy, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Park, AHA (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Earth & Environm Engn, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ap2622@columbia.edu,"Barmak, Katayun/AFU-8454-2022","Barmak, Katayun/0000-0003-0070-158X; Park, Ah-Hyung Alissa/0000-0002-6482-3589; Hsu, Emily/0000-0002-2297-5330",NSF [CBET 1706905],NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)),The authors acknowledge NSF (CBET 1706905) for financially funding this work.,,168,200,208,22,315,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,CAMBRIDGE,"THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND",1463-9262,1463-9270,,GREEN CHEM,Green Chem.,MAR 7,2019,21,5,,,,,919,936,,10.1039/c8gc03688h,http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8gc03688h,,,18,"Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Green & Sustainable Science & Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics,HP5NG,,,Y,N,2024-04-26,WOS:000461723200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Through a three-step workflow consisting of bibliometric literature search, scientometric analysis, and qualitative discussion, this study identified the most influential journals, scholars, articles, and countries that have been active and influential in the C&D waste management research since 2009. Keyword analysis revealed the emerging research topics, such as BIM, prefabricated construction, Big Data, and Circular Economy. The follow-up discussion summarized the mainstream research areas (e.g., qualification of waste generation), discussed research gaps (e.g., integration of BIM and Big Data into C&D waste management), and proposed the framework for near-future research, such as a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of C&D waste diversion, human factors, and design and planning for waste diversion. By providing the big picture of the latest research in C&D waste management since 2009, the paper serves as a multi-disciplinary guide for practitioners and researchers to link current research areas into future trends.","[Jin, Ruoyu] Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Cockcroft Bldg 616, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Yuan, Hongping] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Management, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Qian] Ohio State Univ, Dept Food Agr & Biol Engn, 590 Woody Hayes Dr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University of Brighton; Guangzhou University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Jin, RY (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Sch Environm & Technol, Cockcroft Bldg 616, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",R.Jin@brighton.ac.uk; hpyuan2005@gmail.com; chen.1399@osu.edu,"Jin, Ruoyu/K-6433-2019; Yuan, Hongping/G-7441-2014; Chen, Qian/AAQ-2519-2021; Jin, Ruoyu/A-8520-2017","Yuan, Hongping/0000-0002-2383-4249; Jin, Ruoyu/0000-0003-0360-6967",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71573216]; Sichuan Science and Technology Program [2017ZR0150],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Science and Technology Program,This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.: 71573216) and the Sichuan Science and Technology Program (No.: 2017ZR0150).,,146,198,203,27,549,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

This systematic literature review (n = 77) analyses and discusses the fragmented body of knowledge on the meso-level of supply chains (SCs): (a) to find common ground that underpins the current implementation of the CE on this level; and (b) to identify drivers, inhibitors, and enablers from which CE SC configurations emerge. The review finds that there remain differences in CE definitions that result from claimed antecedents and scopes, resulting in distinct research streams. On the meso-level, eco-industrial parks, environmental SCs, and closed-loop SCs each face significant challenges. The latter potentially offers the largest environmental benefits but engenders radical changes for business models and exposes SCs to more risk. We firstly argue for moving away from using a prescriptive set of practices as definitions for the CE towards a set of overarching goals to allow for the inclusion of future practices and techniques. Secondly, we highlight that research going beyond the meso-level to consider the wider social and institutional environment is needed to solve current challenges.","[Masi, Donato; Day, Steven; Godsell, Janet] Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Day, S (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, Warwick Mfg Grp, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",donato.masi@warwick.ac.uk; S.J.Day@warwick.ac.uk; j.godsell@warwick.ac.uk,"Day, Steven/HNI-1229-2023; Day, Steven/AAG-4579-2020","Day, Steven/0000-0003-2534-1373; Masi, Donato/0000-0002-4553-3244",,,,,87,197,204,5,164,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2017,9,9,,,,,,,1602,10.3390/su9091602,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9091602,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FI0MT,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold, Green Accepted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000411621200172,View Full Record in Web of Science

We present a harmonized multiregional solid waste account, covering 48 world regions, 11 types of solid waste, and 12 waste treatment processes for the year 2007. The account is part of the physical layer of EXIOBASE v2, a multiregional supply and use table. EXIOBASE v2 was used to build a waste-input-output model of the world economy to quantify the solid waste footprint of national consumption. The global amount of recorded solid waste generated in 2007 was approximately 3.2 Gt (gigatonnes(1)), of which 1 Gt was recycled or reused, 0.7 Gt was incinerated, gasified, composted, or used as aggregates, and 1.5 Gt was landfilled. Patterns of waste generation differ across countries, but a significant potential for closing material cycles exists in both high-and low-income countries. The European Union (EU), for example, needs to increase recycling by approximately 100 megatonnes per year (Mt/yr) and reduce landfilling by approximately 35 Mt/yr by 2030 to meet the targets set by the Action Plan for the Circular Economy. Solid waste footprints are strongly coupled with affluence, with income elasticities of around 1.3 for recycled waste, 2.2 for recovery waste, and 1.5 for landfilled waste, respectively. The EXIOBASE v2 solid waste account is based on statistics of recorded waste flows and therefore likely to underestimate actual waste flows.","[Tisserant, Alexandre; Wood, Richard] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol NTNU, Dept Energy & Proc Engn, Ind Ecol Program, Trondheim, Norway; [Pauliuk, Stefan] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, Freiburg, Germany; [Merciai, Stefano; Schmidt, Jannick] 2 0 LCA Consultants, Aalborg, Denmark; [Schmidt, Jannick] Aalborg Univ, Dept Dev & Planning, Aalborg, Denmark; [Fry, Jacob] Univ Sydney, Grp Integrated Sustainabil Anal ISA, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Tukker, Arnold] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Leiden, Netherlands",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); University of Freiburg; Aalborg University; University of Sydney; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Tisserant, A (corresponding author), NTNU, Ind Ecol Program, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",tisserant.alexandre@gmail.com,"Fry, Jacob/AAD-2959-2021; Pauliuk, Stefan/AAC-8274-2022; Tukker, Arnold/M-4596-2013; Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015","Fry, Jacob/0000-0002-2349-6745; Tukker, Arnold/0000-0002-8229-2929; Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324; Schmidt, Jannick/0000-0003-3086-7118; Pauliuk, Stefan/0000-0002-6869-1405",European Commission under DESIRE Project [308552],European Commission under DESIRE Project,"The work of S.P., R.W, S.M., and J.S. was partially funded by the European Commission under the DESIRE Project (grant number 308552).

However, there is a paucity of supporting methodologies and real-life applications to demonstrate how service-oriented companies can implement circular economy principles in daily business practice. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the potential of service-oriented companies in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector to build and implement circular economy business models. To this end, the Backcasting and Eco-design for the Circular Economy (BECE) framework is applied in an ICT firm. BECE, previously developed and demonstrated for product-oriented applications, has been developed further here for applications in the service sector. By shifting the focus from a product-oriented approach to a user centred eco-design, the paper shows how ICT firms can identify, evaluate and prioritise sustainable business model innovations for circular economy. The two most promising business model innovations are explored strategically with the aim of designing circular economy models consistent with the company's priorities of customer satisfaction and profitability. The findings suggest that ICT companies may be able to support the deployment of a circular economy in the service-oriented technology sector. Importantly, micro and small organisations can play a fundamental role if provided with macro-level support to overcome company-level barriers. Finally, the BECE framework is shown to be a valuable resource to explore, analyse and guide the implementation of circular economy opportunities in service oriented organisations. Further research to verify the application of the findings to other service-oriented organisations is recommended. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A circular economy is an alternative to a traditional economy (fabrication, use and dispose) in which we keep resources in a loop for as much time as possible, try to maintain their value while in use, and repurpose for generation of new products at the end of utilization. The value of the global fashion industry is 3000 Billion dollars that accounts for more than 2% of the world's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (https://fashionunited.corn/global-fash ion-industry-statistics/). In the last two decades not only the textile industry has doubled the production but also an average global annual consumption of textiles has doubled from 7 to 13 kg per person and reached to the threshold of 100 million tonnes of textiles consumption. More than two thirds of the textile goes to landfill at the end of their use and just around 15% is recycled. Various scientific studies confirm that the disposal nature of fast fashion and throwaway culture is resulting in a serious environmental, health, social and economic concern. One of the global environmental challenges arising from micro-plastic and micro-textile waste entering into the oceans that can end up in fish and eventually food chain. Herein, through a systematic literature review, the significance of circular fashion and textile is highlighted and various approaches for reuse, recycle and repurposing of the textiles waste as well as disruptive scientific breakthroughs, innovations and strategies towards a circular textile economy have been discussed. Looking into the future, remarks have been made in regards to tackling the key challenges in recycling of textile materials in different stages of their manufacturing process. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In order to achieve this goal, new approaches of Industry 4.0 are being developed and implemented in the field of waste management. The innovative K-project: Recycling and Recovery of Waste 4.0 - ReWaste4.0 deals with topics such as digitalisation and the use of robotic technologies in waste management. Here, a summary of the already published results in these areas, which were divided into the four focused topics, is given: Collection and Logistics, Machines and waste treatment plants, Business models and Data Tools. Presented are systems and methods already used in waste management, as well as technologies that have already been successfully applied in other industrial sectors and will also be relevant in the waste management sector for the future. The focus is set on systems that could be used in waste treatment plants or machines in the future in order to make treatment of waste more efficient. In particular, systems which carry out the sorting of (mixed) waste via robotic technologies are of interest. Furthermore smart bins with sensors for material detection or level measurement, methods for digital image analysis and new business models have already been developed. The technologies are often based on large amounts of data that can contribute to increase the efficiency within plants. In addition, the results of an online market survey of companies from the waste management industry on the subject of waste management 4.0 or digital readiness are summarized. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The heavy metals adsorption efficiency of the sludge-derived biochar was also examined. Among the biochar samples tested, ADSBC600 possessing highly porous structure, special surface chemical behaviors and high thermal stability was found to remove Pb2+ from aqueous solutions efficiently with an adsorption capacity of 51.20 mg/g. The Pb2+ adsorption kinetics and isotherm for ADSBC600 can be described using the pseudo second-order model and Langmuir isotherm, respectively. Analysis of the characteristics of biochar before and after metal treatment suggests that electrostatic attraction, precipitation, surface complexation and ion exchange are the possible Pb2+ removal mechanisms. This study demonstrates a successful example of waste refinery by converting anaerobic digestion sludge to feasible heavy metal adsorbents to implement the concept of circular economy.","[Ho, Shih-Hsin; Chen, Yi-di; Yang, Zhong-kai; Chang, Jo-Shu; Ren, Nan-qi] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Municipal & Environm Engn, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Nagarajan, Dillirani; Chang, Jo-Shu] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Tainan, Taiwan; [Nagarajan, Dillirani] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Chem Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Chang, Jo-Shu] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Res Ctr Energy Technol & Strategy, Tainan, Taiwan",Harbin Institute of Technology; National Cheng Kung University; National Taiwan University; National Cheng Kung University,"Ren, NQ (corresponding author), Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Municipal & Environm Engn, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150090, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",rnq@hit.edu.cn,"Chang, Dr Jo/JUF-2538-2023; Nagarajan, Dillirani/JYP-7139-2024; Chang, Jo-Shu/AAX-4466-2020; Ho, Shih-Hsin/ABI-4317-2020; Ho, Shih-Hsin/D-6187-2013; Chen, Yidi/AAI-7806-2021","Nagarajan, Dillirani/0000-0002-7293-2400; Ho, Shih-Hsin/0000-0001-5187-5235; Ho, Shih-Hsin/0000-0002-9884-1080; Chen, Yidi/0000-0001-8670-4831; Chang, Jo-Shu/0000-0003-3469-9553",State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment (Harbin Institute of Technology - China) [2016TS07]; Project of Thousand Youth Talents,State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment (Harbin Institute of Technology - China)(Harbin Institute of Technology); Project of Thousand Youth Talents,This work was supported by the State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment (Harbin Institute of Technology - China) (No. 2016TS07).

The impact of Industry 4.0 technology adoption on sustainable manufacturing and circular economy has been under-researched. This paper aims to review the latest articles in the area of Industry 4.0, sustainable manufacturing and circular economy and further developed a research framework showing key paths. Design/methodology/approach Qualitative research is performed in two stages. In the first stage, a review of the extant literature is performed to identify the barriers, drivers, challenges and opportunities. In the second stage, a research framework is proposed to integrate Industry 4.0 technology (big data analytics powered artificial intelligence) adoption, sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities. Findings This research extends the knowledge base by providing a detailed review of Industry 4.0, sustainable manufacturing, and circular economy and proposes a research framework by integrating these three contemporary concepts in the context of supply chain management. Through an exploration of this integrative research framework, the authors propose a future research agenda and seven research propositions. Research limitations/implications It is important to understand the interplay between institutional pressures, tangible resources and human skills for Industry 4.0 technology (big data analytics powered artificial intelligence) adoption. Industry 4.0 technology (big data analytics powered artificial intelligence) adoption can positively influence sustainable manufacturing and circular economy capabilities. Managers must also put more attention to sustainable manufacturing to develop circular economic capabilities. Social implications Factory workers and the local communities generally suffer from various adverse effects resulting from the traditional manufacturing process. The quality of the environment is deteriorating to such an extent that people even staying miles away from the factory are also affected due to environmental pollution that is generated from factory operations. Hence, sustainable manufacturing is the only choice left to manufacturers that can help in the transition to a circular economy.

Recent reviews on the topic of the circular economy have indicated that cultural barriers are a significant factor hindering the diffusion of so-called circular' business models, particularly the lack of consumeror useracceptance. However, none of them has provided an overview of the existing literature addressing such issues that can help academics and practitioners better understand consumption considerations when addressing the circular economy. Motivated by these observations, this paper presents the results of a literature review that summarises and discusses insights from 111 articles in terms of the problem area, theoretical approaches, methods, and tools that have been used to collect and analyse data, the main issues, and identified research gaps. The results show that most of the existing scientific work on the circular economy and circular solutions addressing consumption has focussed on identifying factors that drive or hinder the consumption of circular solutions. A smaller but expanding set of articles has focussed on offering insights into the nature, meaning, and dynamics of consumption in the context of the circular economy. According to this set of articles, consumption in the circular economy is anonymous, connected, political, uncertain, and based on multiple values, not only utility. A smaller set of papers has explored the integration of user and consumer perspectives into design processes. Although these contributions are relevant, opportunities for further research are still open, particularly regarding socio-material and cultural aspects of consumption in the context of the circular economy, and the role of digitalisation. In addition, more work could be done regarding strategies to foster not only acceptance but also the adoption and diffusion of the circular economy. Based on the findings of this literature review, some ideas for a research agenda on the issue of consumption in the circular economy are outlined.","[Camacho-Otero, Juana; Boks, Casper; Pettersen, Ida Nilstad] NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture & Design, Dept Design, Kolbjorn Hejes Vei 2b, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Camacho-Otero, J (corresponding author), NTNU Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Architecture & Design, Dept Design, Kolbjorn Hejes Vei 2b, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",juana.camacho-otero@ntnu.no; casper.boks@ntnu.no; ida.nilstad.pettersen@ntnu.no,"Camacho-Otero, Juana/S-2072-2019","Pettersen, Ida Nilstad/0000-0003-3979-9772; Boks, Casper/0000-0002-3410-0582; Camacho-Otero, Juana/0000-0001-6855-565X",EU through the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network Action,EU through the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network Action,This research was conducted as part of the Circular European Economy Innovative Training Network funded by the EU through the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network Action.,,167,193,204,38,253,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2018,10,8,,,,,,,2758,10.3390/su10082758,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10082758,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3CI,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000446767700174,View Full Record in Web of Science

Packaging industry is the sector using the largest share of plastics, hence packaging dominates in the plastic waste flow. The aim of this paper was to sum up the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging waste in Finland. This potential was evaluated based on the quantity, composition and mechanical quality of the plastic packaging waste generated by consumers and collected as a source-separated fraction, within the mixed municipal solid waste (MSW) or within energy waste. Based on the assessment 86,000-117,000 tons (18 kg/person/a) of post-consumer plastic packaging waste was generated in Finland in 2014. The majority, 84% of the waste was in the mixed MSW flow in 2014. Due to the launching of new sorting facilities and separate collections for post-consumer plastic packaging in 2016, almost 40% of the post-consumer plastic packaging could become available for recycling. However, a 50% recycling rate for post-consumer plastic packaging (other than PET bottles) would be needed to increase the overall MSW recycling rate from the current 41% by around two percentage points. The share of monotype plastics in the overall MSW plastics fraction was 80%, hence by volume the recycling potential of MSW plastics is high. Polypropylene (PP) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) were the most common plastic types present in mixed MSW, followed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS) and high density polyethylene (HDPE). If all the Finnish plastic packaging waste collected through the three collection types would be available for recycling, then 19,000-25,000 tons of recycled PP and 6000-8000 tons of recycled HDPE would be available on the local market. However, this assessment includes uncertainties due to performing the composition study only on mixed MSW plastic fraction. In order to obtain more precise figures of the recycling potential of post-consumer plastic packaging, more studies should be performed on both the quantities and the qualities of plastic wastes. The mechanical and rheological test results indicated that even plastic wastes originating from the mixed MSW, can be useful raw materials. Recycled HDPE showed a smaller decline in the mechanical properties than recycled PP. The origin and processing method of waste plastic seemed to have less effect on the mechanical quality than the type of plastic. The applicability of a plastic waste for a product needs to be assessed case by case, due to product specific quality requirements. In addition to mechanical properties, the chemical composition of plastic wastes is of major importance, in order to be able to restrict hazardous substances from being circulated undesirably. In addition to quantity and quality of plastic wastes, the sustainability of the whole recycling chain needs to be assessed prior to launching operations so that the chain can be optimized to generate both environmental and economic benefits to society and operators.

However, a PSS is no implicit guarantee for a CE, and CE strategies do not necessarily lead to decoupling economic growth from resource consumption in absolute terms. Absolute resource decoupling only occurs when the resource use declines, irrespective of the growth rate of the economic driver. In this forum paper, we propose a two-step framework that aims to support analyses of PSS and their potential to lead to absolute resource decoupling. In the first step, we present four PSS enablers of relative resource reduction that qualify as CE strategies. In the second step, three subsequent requirements need to be met, in order to successfully achieve absolute resource decoupling. Conditions and limitations for this accomplishment are discussed. Danish textile cases are used to exemplify the framework elements and its application. We expect that the framework will challenge the debate on the necessary conditions for CE strategies to ensure absolute resource decoupling.","[Kjaer, Louise Laumann; Pigosso, Daniela C.

The GSCM implementation and performance assessment is relatively important for survival in an ever-increasingly competitive environment. Within the circular economy context; companies that aim to improve GSCM must constantly monitor their performance. In order to integrate the circular economy concept into GSCM, it is required to achieve an optimal balance of environmental, economic, logistics, organizational, and marketing performance indicators. However, in the literature, these indicators were investigated separately in terms of GSCM performance assessment, therefore, to achieve this optimal balance, it is necessary to assess these different indicators. Within this context, the aim of this paper is to propose a new holistic conceptual GSCM performance assessment framework which integrates environmental, economic, logistics, operational, organizational and marketing performance. The framework has three-dimensional hierarchy which includes the main criteria, sub-criteria, and the measures for the GSCM performance assessment which have great significance to implement effective GSCM.

It can help closing the material loops by providing accurate information on the availability, location and condition of products. Digitalisation also enables more efficient processes in companies, helps minimise waste, promotes longer life for products and minimises the transaction costs. Thus, digitalisation boosts the circular economy business models by helping to close the loop, slow the material loop and narrow the loop with increased resource efficiency. However, there are still many challenges to be solved in order to gain the desired benefits and gaps hindering digital technology-aided circular business models implementation. The existing literature that discusses the opportunities and challenges of digitalisation is still very limited, and therefore, our exploratory and qualitative study seeks to clarify these perspectives. There is a significant research gap in understanding those challenges and finding solutions to them. In our study, we identified challenges related to adopting novel business models, data collection and management, collaboration and competence requirements. The virtualization of products and processes, collaboration with stakeholders and utilising digitalization were highlighted to be major opportunities in adopting CE-based business models.

A review of the extant literature was carried out to identify factors that influence salvage performance of structural components of buildings during their useful life. Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated. The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life. BWPE will therefore provide a decision support mechanism for the architects and designers to analyse the implication, of designs decision on the salvage performance of buildings over time. It will also be useful to the demolition engineers and consultants to generate pre-demolition audit when the building gets to end of its life.","[Akanbi, Lukman A.; Oyedele, Lukumon O.; Akinade, Olugbenga O.; Ajayi, Anuoluwapo O.; Delgado, Manuel Davila; Bilal, Muhammad] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, BERIC, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Bello, Sururah A.] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Ife, Nigeria",University of West England; Obafemi Awolowo University,"Oyedele, LO (corresponding author), Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, BERIC, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.;Oyedele, LO (corresponding author), Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Enterprise & Project Management, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",Ayolook2001@yahoo.co.uk,"Akanbi, Lukman Adewale/HMW-1378-2023","Akanbi, Lukman Adewale/0000-0003-1258-9142; Akinade, Olugbenga/0000-0003-3950-3775","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); Innovate UK [54832-413479, 102473]; EPSRC [EP/N509012/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Innovate UK [102473] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/N509012/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Innovate UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Innovate UK(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Innovate UK); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),The authors would like to acknowledge and express their sincere gratitude to the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and Innovate UK (grant applications No. 54832-413479/File No. 102473) for providing the financial support for this study.,,68,191,197,19,158,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Although the concept draws on contributions from various academic disciplines, and despite its increasingly frequent use, few scholars clearly define what a circular business model is. Understanding about what makes a business model circular is diverse, hampering the theoretical development and practical application of circular business models. This study aims to help frame the field of circular business model research, by clarifying the fundamentals of the concept from the perspectives of resource efficiency and business model innovation. Expanding on these findings, a review of how the concept is used in recent academic literature is provided. It shows that a coherent view is lacking on which resource efficiency strategies classify a business model as circular. This study clarifies which resource efficiency strategies can be deemed as relevant key strategies for circular business models, and suggests a new definition of the concept. With the definition grounded in analysis of the fundamentals in terms of resource efficiency and business models, the study contributes to theoretical advancement and effective implementation of circular business models.","[Nussholz, Julia L.

The available commercial or close-to-commercial techniques facing this challenge can be divided into mechanical, thermal, and chemical processing. However, these methods typically require a high energy input and do not take the recycling of the thermoset matrix itself into account. Rather, they focus on retrieving the more valuable fibers, fillers, or substrates. To increase the circularity of thermoset products, many academic studies report potential solutions which require a reduced energy input by using degradable linkages or dynamic covalent bonds. However, the majority of these studies have limited potential for industrial implementation. This review aims to bridge the gap between the industrial and academic developments by focusing on those which are most relevant from a technological, sustainable and economic point of view. An overview is given of currently used approaches for the recycling of thermoset materials, the development of novel inherently recyclable thermosets and examples of possible applications that could reach the market in the near future.","[Post, Wouter; Susa, Arijana; Blaauw, Rolf; Molenveld, Karin; Knoop, Rutger J.

However, progress is promoting a shift in perspective from environmental impacts to resource recovery. Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) has been increasing in developed countries, thus the amount of air pollution control residues (APCr) and fly ashes (FA) have followed the same upward trend. APCr from MSWI is classified as hazardous waste in the List ofWaste (LoW) and as an absolute entry (19 01 07*), but FA may be classified as a mirror entry (19 0 13*/19 01 14). These properties arise mainly fromtheir content in soluble salts, potentially toxicmetals, trace organic pollutants and high pHin contact with water. Since these residues have been mostly disposed of in underground and landfills, other possibilities must be investigated to recover secondary raw materials and products. According to the literature, four additional routes of recovery have been found: detoxification (e.g. washing), product manufacturing (e.g. ceramic products and cement), practical applications (e.g. CO2 sequestration) and recovery of materials (e.g. Zn and salts). This work aims to identify the best available technologies for material recovery in order to avoid landfill solutions. Within this scope, six case studies are presented and discussed: recycling in lightweight aggregates, glass-ceramics, cement, recovery of zinc, rare metals and salts. Finally, future perspectives are provided to advance understanding of this anthropogenic waste as a source of resources, yet tied to safeguards for the environment. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Refurbishment is a process in which a professional company collects and restores used products in order to resell these products to new consumers. Building on insights from the remanufacturing literature, this research is the first to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that influence consumer acceptance of refurbished products, and in specific refurbished mobile phones. We adopted a qualitative approach using in-depth interviews with consumers (n = 20) of new and refurbished phones to gain rich insights into consumers' considerations that play a role in the choice of a refurbished product over a new product. This paper maps out the main factors that influence consumer acceptance of refurbished mobile phones. Our findings uncover that the majority of consumers do not take a refurbished product into consideration as a consequence of a lack of awareness and a misunderstanding of what refurbishment actually entails. In addition, refurbished products are often rejected as a consequence of a negative trade-off between perceived risks and benefits. Personal, contextual and product-related factors have been identified that influence consumers' assessment of a refurbished product's risks and benefits. Finally, the findings have been translated into practical guidelines for designers and marketers to positively steer consumer perception of refurbished products. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, limited attention has been given in the literature to explore the drivers and barriers in CE implementation in emerging and developing countries besides China. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to identify the drivers and barriers to implementing a CE in Pakistan's automobile manufacturing industry. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts an explorative approach to understand the drivers and barriers at the micro-level CE implementation in Pakistan's automobile industry. The research design includes both qualitative and quantitative methods using a survey instrument and interviews to gather data. The use of the two main sources of data provides the opportunity for triangulation of the data to improve the validity of the findings, and enables greater inferences from the results. Findings This study shows that profitability/market share/benefit (30 percent), cost reduction (22 percent) and business principle/concern for environment/appreciation (19 percent) are the top three drivers. Similarly, unawareness (22 percent), cost and financial constraint (20 percent) and lack of expertise (17 percent) are the top three barriers in implementing CE principles in Pakistan automobiles industry. Research limitations/ implications - This study considers only Pakistan automobiles industry, and the practical implications potentially limit to emerging Asian economies. Originality/value This study is the first of its kind that has investigated the drivers and barriers of CE at the organizational level in the automobile industry of Pakistan. Thus, it helps to advance the understanding of the subject matter and enables the formulation of effective policies and business strategies by practitioners for upscaling CE and sustainability.","[Agyemang, Martin] Dalian Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Kusi-Sarpong, Simonov] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England; [Kusi-Sarpong, Simonov; Kusi-Sarpong, Horsten] Ecoengn & Management Consult Ltd, Accra, Ghana; [Khan, Sharfuddin Ahmed] Univ Sharjah, Ind Engn & Engn Management Dept, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Mani, Venkatesh] Montpellier Business Sch, Montpellier, France; [Rehman, Syed Tahaur] NED Univ Engn & Technol, Karachi, Pakistan",Dalian University of Technology; University of Portsmouth; University of Sharjah; Montpellier Business School; Ned University of Engineering & Technology,"Kusi-Sarpong, S (corresponding author), Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Portsmouth, Hants, England.;Kusi-Sarpong, S (corresponding author), Ecoengn & Management Consult Ltd, Accra, Ghana.",martinon463@yahoo.com; simonov2002@yahoo.com; skhan@sharjah.ac.ae; m.venkatesh@montpellier-bs.com; s.taharehman@gmail.com; horstenk@yahoo.com,"Venkatesh, Mani/Q-1842-2016; Agyemang, Martin/AAI-7054-2020; jam, amir/O-6460-2019","Venkatesh, Mani/0000-0001-5291-6115; Agyemang, Martin/0000-0002-9313-1207; Kusi-Sarpong, Simonov/0000-0003-1618-2518",,,,,105,189,191,22,181,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0025-1747,1758-6070,,MANAGE DECIS,Manag.

With the renewed interest of policy makers in the circular economy, material efficiency (ME) strategies such as light-weighting and downsizing of and lifetime extension for products, reuse and recycling of materials, and appropriate material choice are being promoted. Yet, the emissions savings from ME remain poorly understood, owing in part to the multitude of material uses and diversity of circumstances and in part to a lack of analytical effort. We have reviewed emissions reductions from ME strategies applied to buildings, cars, and electronics. We find that there can be a systematic trade-off between material use in the production of buildings, vehicles, and appliances and energy use in their operation, requiring a careful life cycle assessment of ME strategies. We find that the largest potential emission reductions quantified in the literature result from more intensive use of and lifetime extension for buildings and the light-weighting and reduced size of vehicles. Replacing metals and concrete with timber in construction can result in significant GHG benefits, but trade-offs and limitations to the potential supply of timber need to be recognized. Repair and remanufacturing of products can also result in emission reductions, which have been quantified only on a case-by-case basis and are difficult to generalize. The recovery of steel, aluminum, and copper from building demolition waste and the end-of-life vehicles and appliances already results in the recycling of base metals, which achieves significant emission reductions. Higher collection rates, sorting efficiencies, and the alloy-specific sorting of metals to preserve the function of alloying elements while avoiding the contamination of base metals are important steps to further reduce emissions.","[Hertwich, Edgar G.; Fishman, Tomer; Heeren, Niko; Asghari, Farnaz Nojavan; Tu, Qingshi; Wolfram, Paul] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Ali, Saleem] Univ Delaware, Coll Earth Ocean & Environm, Newark, DE 19716 USA; [Ciacci, Luca] Univ Bologna, Dept Ind Chem, Viale Risorgimento 4, I-40136 Bologna, Italy; [Fishman, Tomer] Interdisciplinary Ctr, Herzliyya, Israel; [Masanet, Eric] Northwestern Univ, Dept Mech Engn, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Olivetti, Elsa] MIT, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Pauliuk, Stefan] Univ Freiburg, Fac Environm & Nat Resources, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",Yale University; University of Delaware; University of Bologna; Reichman University; Northwestern University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Freiburg,"Hertwich, EG (corresponding author), Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",,"Ciacci, Luca/T-9280-2019; Ali, Saleem H./I-1545-2013; Hertwich, Edgar G/D-2169-2011; Pauliuk, Stefan/AAC-8274-2022; Masanet, Eric/I-5649-2012; Heeren, Niko/N-3390-2017; Fishman, Tomer/C-9772-2015","Ciacci, Luca/0000-0002-5151-5384; Ali, Saleem H./0000-0002-2943-9557; Hertwich, Edgar G/0000-0002-4934-3421; Heeren, Niko/0000-0003-4967-6557; Fishman, Tomer/0000-0003-4405-2382; Pauliuk, Stefan/0000-0002-6869-1405; /0000-0002-8043-2385; Tu, Qingshi/0000-0001-7113-0564",UN Environment,UN Environment,"This review was conducted as part of an assessment requested by the G7 environment ministers at their meeting in Bologna in June 2017 [9], which is currently carried out by the International Resource Panel.

A key question in feeding the future world is: how much ASF should we eat? We demonstrate that livestock raised under the circular economy concept could provide a significant, nonnegligible part (9-23g/per capita) of our daily protein needs (similar to 50-60g/per capita). This livestock then would not consume human-edible biomass, such as grains, but mainly convert leftovers from arable land and grass resources into valuable food, implying that production of livestock feed is largely decoupled from arable land. The availability of these biomass streams for livestock then determines the boundaries for livestock production and consumption. Under this concept, the competition for land for feed or food would be minimized and compared to no ASF, including some ASF in the human diet could free up about one quarter of global arable land. Our results also demonstrate that restricted growth in consumption of ASF in Africa and Asia would be feasible under these boundary conditions, while reductions in the rest of the world would be necessary to meet land use sustainability criteria. Managing this expansion and contraction of future consumption of ASF is essential for achieving sustainable nutrition security.","[Van Zanten, Hannah H.

Highly porous and lightweight fly ash-based geopolymers were produced and then evaluated as methylene blue adsorbents. The geopolymers' porosity strongly affects the dye extraction, a threefold increase (from 5.4 to 15.4 mg/g) being observed when the porosity rises from 40.7 to 80.6%. The maximum uptake reported here (15.4 mg/g) surpasses several other powdered adsorbents, which demonstrates the interesting potential of this innovative adsorbent. Moreover, these monolithic adsorbents can be used directly in packed beds as membranes, this being a major advantage over powdered adsorbents. Furthermore, these adsorbents were successfully regenerated and reused (up to five cycles) without compromising the performances. In fact, enhanced methylene blue uptake (up to 20.5 mg/g) was observed after regeneration. Additionally, an unexplored waste stream was used as raw material which mitigates the waste environmental footprint contributing towards a circular economy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Results indicated that the firms had a relatively good understanding about the circular economy and its values and had a strong willingness to operate a circular economy, but this was not indicative of enthusiastic behavior. A striking gap existed between a firm's awareness and its actual behavior in developing a circular economy. Reasons for the gap are explored mainly based on the results of interviews.

J,"Fischer, A; Pascucci, S",,,,"Fischer, Aglaia; Pascucci, Stefano",,,Institutional incentives in circular economy transition: The case of material use in the Dutch textile industry,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CRADLE,"The aim of this paper is to gain insight into how requirements for transitioning to circular economy creates new organizational forms in inter-firm collaborations, and ultimately how they stimulate the emergence of new institutions enhancing sustainability. Two strands of literature, one on circular economy and one on institutional analysis, provide the theoretical background for this research. Currently a clearly formulated and unified theory on the institutions of circular economy is lacking. Therefore this research compares and contrasts empirical evidence from cases derived from the textile industry in The Netherlands, and concepts derived from institutional analysis and literature on circular economy to inductively build a cohesive conceptual framework. Using information from cases we identified two pathways to transition into circular economy and to manage circular material flows. We define these pathways Status Quo arrangements (SQ), when firms focus on optimizing up-cycling technologies and infrastructure in their circular relations and collaborations, and Product as Service arrangements (PAS), to indicate a focus on providing products in service contracts. Chain coordination, contracting, and financial mechanisms were identified as key organizational elements for creating new pathways to transition into circular materials flows. However in analyzing these elements we also highlight differences between SQ and PAS arrangements. SQ arrangements may have implications at the level of formal rules, for example by creating a new industry standards for up-cycled fabrics. PAS arrangements may have wider implications, for example by reshaping ownership in service contracts and creating cascading activities. Moving ownership to the supply chain will result in increased responsibility for materials and will create an incentive for improving quality of products, including their environmental performance. This is expected to generate positive socio-environmental impacts at a system level as well. Moreover PAS arrangements may have bottom up effects at a formal institutional level, resulting in alteration and creation of formal rules, for example in terms of new approaches to the ownership of materials.

Business with ethical and sustainable operations has become the need of the day in the present environment of Industry 4.0 and circular economy. It has been observed that the application of Industry 4.0 technologies may help in achieving the goal of ethical and sustainable operations. Although a lot of research has been done in context to larger enterprises, limited research is available on the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in SMEs for ethical and sustainable operations. The espousal of Industry 4.0 technologies is a challenging task for SMEs due to various operational and financial constraints. The problem is more acute, specifically in context to developing countries like India. Keeping in mind the role of technologies in ethical business and circular economy, we have identified fifteen challenges, impacting the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in SMEs. A questionnaire was designed for collecting the response from industry and academic experts. On the collected data, the DEMATEL approach has been applied to check the degree of influence and interrelationship among challenges. It has also helped in the categorization of factors as cause and effect. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to validate the results obtained from the DEMATEL approach. Authors have observed that lack of motivation from partners and customers on the application of I4.0 technologies is the leading challenge. Fear of failure of I4.0 technologies is the main effect group challenge. The findings of the study will help SMEs in formulating strategies for implementing Industry 4.0 technologies for ethical and sustainable business processes.

Interest in the concept of Circular Economy has surged in recent years among policy makers and business actors. An increasing amount of literature touches upon the conceptualisation of Circular Economy, the development of 'circular solutions' and circular business models, and policies for a Circular Economy. However, relevant studies on resource efficiency policies mostly utilise a case-by-case or sector-by-sector approach and do not consider the systemic interdependencies of the underlying operational policy framework. In this contribution, a mapping of the existing resource policy framework in the European Union (EU) is undertaken, and used as a basis for identifying policy areas that have been less prominent in influencing material resource efficiency. Employing a life cycle approach, policies affecting material efficiency in the production and consumption stages of a product have been found to be poorly utilised so far in the EU. Taking this as a point of departure, three policy areas that can contribute to closing material loops and increasing resource efficiency are thoroughly discussed and their application challenges are highlighted. The three policy areas are: (1) policies for reuse, repair and remanufacturing; (2) green public procurement and innovation procurement; and (3) policies for improving secondary materials markets. Finally, a potential policy mix, including policy instruments from the three mentioned policy areas-together with policy mixing principles-is presented to outline a possible pathway for transitioning to Circular Economy policy making.","[Milios, Leonidas] Lund Univ, Int Inst Ind Environm Econ, POB 196,Tegnersplatsen 4, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Milios, L (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Int Inst Ind Environm Econ, POB 196,Tegnersplatsen 4, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",leonidas.milios@iiiee.lu.se,,,Mistra REES (Resource Efficient and Effective Solutions) programme - Mistra (The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research),Mistra REES (Resource Efficient and Effective Solutions) programme - Mistra (The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research),"This research was supported by the Mistra REES (Resource Efficient and Effective Solutions) programme, funded by Mistra (The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research).

We found that political leadership, building adaptable future visions, using experimental approaches (such as living labs), developing contextual knowledge about resource use, and engaging with diverse stakeholders to be important. However, we also expose that there is a lack of consensus on what a circular city constitutes and a need to further untangle the how and why of the circular city concept.

Driven by a low carbon circular economy, bioplastics production is estimated to reach a 40% share of the plastics market by 2030 (Bioplastics Market Data, 2018). It is expected to substitute petrochemical-based plastics in many applications, from food packaging, pharmaceuticals, electronics, agriculture to textiles. The current biodegradable bioplastics have met challenges in competing with engineering polymers such as PET and Nylon in terms of processing capacity at the industry scale, mechanical robustness, thermal resistance, and stability. Poly(glycolic acid) (PGA) has a similar chemical structure to PLA but without the methyl side group, which allows the polymer chains to pack together tightly and results in a high degree of crystallinity (45-55%), high thermal stability (T-m= 220-230 degrees C), exceptionally high gas barrier (3 times higher than EVOH), as well as high mechanical strength (115 MPa) and stiffness (7 GPa). Meanwhile, PGA is rapidly biodegradable and 100% compostable, showing a similar biodegradation profile to cellulose. To date, PGA has been mainly used in the form of copolymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). Its unique properties have often been overlooked and are yet to be explored. This is caused by its intrinsic characteristics such as high hydrophilicity, rapid degradation, insolubility in most organic solvents and brittleness that have hindered its practical applications. Here we introduced the synthetic chemistry, processing methods, modification, and applications of PGA, aiming to provide a critical discussion about the technical challenges, development opportunities, and solutions for PGA-based materials. The future direction and perspectives for high-performance PGA are proposed. Given its synthesis diversity and unique properties, PGA shows great potential to substitute engineering petrochemical-based polymers for high temperature and high gas barrier packaging applications.","[Samantaray, Paresh Kumar; Little, Alastair; McNally, Tony; Wan, Chaoying] Univ Warwick, WMG, Int Inst Nanocomposites Mfg IINM, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Haddleton, David M.] Univ Warwick, Dept Chem, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Tan, Bowen; Sun, Zhaoyang; Huang, Weijie; Ji, Yang] PJIM Polymer Sci Co Ltd, Shanghai 201102, Peoples R China",University of Warwick; University of Warwick,"Wan, CY (corresponding author), Univ Warwick, WMG, Int Inst Nanocomposites Mfg IINM, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Chaoying.Wan@warwick.ac.uk,"Huang, Weijie/KCJ-7179-2024; Haddleton, David M/A-6233-2009; Samantaray, Paresh K/B-2108-2019; wan, chaoying/O-6921-2015","Samantaray, Paresh K/0000-0003-2533-929X; wan, chaoying/0000-0002-1079-5885; Haddleton, David/0000-0002-4965-0827; McNally, Tony/0000-0001-5436-4211; Little, Alastair/0000-0002-5313-8527",Pujing Chemical Industry co.

Due to the concern on significant resources consumption in the construction industry without concerning the physical limit resources, a paradigm shift of linear economy to CE model is inevitable for conserving the resources and promoting the efficient use of resources. Adopting CE into the construction industry can promote the successful transition to sustainable construction. Although early stage of development in the construction industry, the scientific contribution of CE agenda in the construction industry is significantly increasing. Therefore, this review aimed to identity the implications, considerations, contributions and challenges of CE in the construction industry by systematically analyzing the recent literature. In addition to existing trends and considerations, this study highlighted the numerous challenges under design, materials selection, supply chain, business model, uncertainty and risk, collaborations among actions, knowledge of understanding, relevant policy, integration of urban metabolism, and methodology for CE evaluation. The study found that CE implementation into the case-specific building with full scale evaluation is yet to be conducted, and a comprehensive CE integration and methodology framework is yet to be developed. A prospective integrated framework for CE adoption and evaluation method is proposed by analyzing the contemporary issues. It is believed that the analyzed critical issues for CE adoption, identified future research direction, and proposed frameworks and methodology should help further development of CE research and contribution to effective implementation of CE into the industry for promoting sustainable construction.","[Hossain, Md Uzzal; Ng, S.

Circular Economy concepts are well suited to the building and construction sector in cities. For example, refurbishing and adaptively reusing underutilized or abandoned buildings can revitalize neighborhoods whilst achieving environmental benefits. Cultural heritage buildings hold a unique niche in the urban landscape. In addition to shelter, they embody the local cultural and historic characteristics that define communities. Therefore, extending their useful lifespan has multiple benefits that extend beyond the project itself to the surrounding area, contributing to economic and social development. To explore this complex issue, the research applies systematic literature review and synthesis methods. Decision makers lack knowledge of the environmental benefits of adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings and lack tools to implement these projects. A new comprehensive circular economy framework for the adaptive reuse of cultural heritage buildings to reduce environmental impacts intends to meet these needs. The framework integrates methods and techniques from the building and construction literature that aim to reduce lifecycle environmental impact of buildings with a circular product supply chain approach.","[Foster, Gillian] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Ecol Econ, Dept Socioecon, Welthandelspl 1-D5, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Foster, G (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Ecol Econ, Dept Socioecon, Welthandelspl 1-D5, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",gillian.foster@wu.ac.at,,"Foster, Gillian/0000-0001-6978-3830",European Union [776758]; CLIC - Circular models Leveraging Investments in Cultural heritage adaptive reuse,European Union(European Union (EU)); CLIC - Circular models Leveraging Investments in Cultural heritage adaptive reuse,"This research was funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 Project ID: 776758, CLIC - Circular models Leveraging Investments in Cultural heritage adaptive reuse.

In this sense, Industrial Ecology (IE) with its tools can assist in the transition to CE. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to present the theoretical contribution of IE to CE. The methodology used was based on bibliometric analysis in the international context. With regard to the bibliometric analyses, we have identified that the evolution of CE would not be possible without the existence of IE concepts and tools, especially with tools such as Industrial Symbiosis (IS) and Eco-Industrial Parks (EIPs). Furthermore, three levels of IE contribution to CE were identified, such as: conceptual, technical and policy aspects. Finally, new CE based researches from an IE perspective with bibliometric analysis and with co-citation networks are possible, including, solid waste management and policies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The stock and emissions of PBDE congeners were estimated using a dynamic substance flow analysis model, CiP-CAFE. To evaluate our results, the emission estimates were used as input to the BETR-Global model. Estimated concentrations were compared with observed concentrations in air from background areas. The global (a) in-use and (b) waste stocks of Sigma 5BDE(28, 47, 99, 153, 183) and BDE209 are estimated to be (a) similar to 25 and 400 kt and (b) 13 and 100 kt, respectively, in 2018. A total of 6 (0.3-13) and 10.5 (9-12) kt of Sigma 5BDE and BDE209, respectively, has been emitted to the atmosphere by 2018. More than 70% of PBDE emissions during production and use occurred in the industrialized regions, while more than 70% of the emissions during waste disposal occurred in the less industrialized regions. A total of 70 kt of Sigma 5BDE and BDE209 was recycled within products since 1970. As recycling rates are expected to increase under the circular economy, an additional 45 kt of PBDEs (mainly BDE209) may reappear in new products.","[Abbasi, Golnoush; Breivik, Knut] Norwegian Inst Air Res, Box 100, NO-2027 Kjeller, Norway; [Li, Li] Univ Toronto Scarborough, Dept Phys & Environm Sci, 1265 Mil Trail, Toronto, ON M1C 1A4, Canada; [Breivik, Knut] Univ Oslo, Dept Chem, Box 1033, NO-0315 Oslo, Norway",NILU; University of Toronto; University Toronto Scarborough; University of Oslo,"Abbasi, G (corresponding author), Norwegian Inst Air Res, Box 100, NO-2027 Kjeller, Norway.",goa@nilu.no,"Li, Li/AAH-4031-2019; Breivik, Knut/D-2311-2011","Li, Li/0000-0002-5157-7366; Breivik, Knut/0000-0003-1112-1900; Abbasi, Golnoush/0000-0002-0486-8363","Research Council of Norway [213577, 244298]; MITACS Elevate postdoctoral fellowship",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); MITACS Elevate postdoctoral fellowship,This study was financed by the Research Council of Norway (213577 and 244298).

At the same time there is no generally accepted monitoring framework. Rather, what exists is a large variety of measurement approaches that aim to assess the progress. The different assessment methodologies cover different and varied aspects of the CE transition and are seemingly unrelated to each other. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is the provision of a structured picture of the current stock of CE metrics, including the identification of methodology clusters and the related assessment perspectives. The method of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was used to assess 63 CE metrics and 24 features relevant to CE, such as recycling efficiency, longevity and stock availability. The MCA was used to assess how the different CE features are associated to each other and how they are related with each of the 63 metrics. Also, it was determined which combinations of CE features are frequently assessed together. The analysis identified three main clusters of metrics, (1) a resource-efficiency cluster, (2) a materials stocks and flows cluster, (3) a product-centric cluster. The results of the analysis show poor integration of resource-efficiency and product-centric perspectives, while the product-centric and system-dynamic perspectives are least frequently assessed. Further, the analysis provides the most prevailing CE perspectives and it is shown that only a few CE metrics assess CE features that are related to the maintenance of value. The MCA provides a guidance for further metrics development, as it identifies areas with a lower metrics density. For a detailed analysis, a standardized visualisation framework for CE metrics is derived, which allows to compare individual metrics in a simple and illustrative way. The goal of the visualisation framework is to provide guidance for (i) the integration of the most complementary CE metrics and (ii) facilitate further metrics development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Many barriers should be overcome, concerning the introduction of environmental policies, effective investments, social inclusion and public awareness, which are significant issues in low-middle income countries. The Circular Economy could represent the answer for improving current solid waste management activities worldwide, since denote the principle of waste valorization and recycling for boosting developing economies. This paper is focused on this theme, analyzing main opportunities for improving the current state of solid waste management in developing big cities. The solid waste management of two countries are reviewed: Romania is the emerging country where Circular Economy is becoming a future objective due to economic aids and strength regulations which the European Union (EU) established for the nations forming parts the alliance; as a comparison, Bolivia is reported for evaluating main differences founded for developing recycling systems in a no-EU country. These two case studies could be of interest for highlighting main pros and cons of the participation into a wide organization like the EU for introducing in short terms Circular Economy principles. Moreover, a theoretical Circular Economy model for developing big cities in low-middle income countries is described within the study for effectively comparing which chances can spread for these countries as regard municipal solid waste exploitation. Despite the economic level, Romania and Bolivia are both facing with many solid waste management issues although in different magnitude. For the Romanian case study, it is visible how it cannot achieve the European goals for 2020 due the need of change in public recycling behavior. Bolivia, instead, represents the case where international aids and new investments are required, considering the informal sector into the formal management system as a real opportunity for improving local recycling rate. In conclusion, the comparison suggests how external supports led to implement the principles of the Circular Economy within a developing region. The model of Circular Economy proposed is recommended for developing big cities in order to advance a new form of safe employment, encouraging the activities that are still in action (i.e. informal sector) and boosting the principles of sustainable development.","[Ferronato, Navarro; Rada, Elena Cristina; Torretta, Vincenzo] Univ Insubria, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Via GB Vico 46, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Rada, Elena Cristina; Ragazzi, Marco] Univ Trento, Dept Civil Environm & Mech Engn, Via Mesiano 77, I-38123 Trento, Italy; [Rada, Elena Cristina; Cioca, Lucian Ionel] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Fac Engn, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Sibiu, Romania; [Portillo, Marcelo Antonio Gorritty] Univ Mayor San Andres, Inst Res & Dev Chem Proc, Calle 30, La Paz, Bolivia; [Cioca, Lucian Ionel] Acad Romanian Scientists, Bucharest 010071, Romania",University of Insubria; University of Trento; Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu; Universidad Mayor de San Andres; Academy of Romanian Scientists (AOSR),"Ferronato, N (corresponding author), Univ Insubria, Dept Theoret & Appl Sci, Via GB Vico 46, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",nferronato@uninsubria.it,"Rada, Elena Cristina/AAA-8329-2019; CIOCA, Lucian-Ionel/B-5517-2012","CIOCA, Lucian-Ionel/0000-0002-5467-9114; Ferronato, Navarro/0000-0001-7850-5461; Torretta, Vincenzo/0000-0002-7594-1169",,,,,67,182,188,7,199,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

At the same time, eco-innovation (EI) has been recognised as a key element in carrying out the transition from a linear to a circutar system of production and consumption. However, little information can be found concerning whether and how El can actually facilitate the change to a CE. While extensive literature on El, and a growing body of research exploring the CE, already exist, there is, as yet, no comprehensive understanding concerning the connections between these two concepts. Drawing on academic contributions from the fields of El and CE, this analysis seeks to clarify and synthesise findings at the intersection of these two fields. The aim is threefold: derive literature-based working definitions of CE and El; review the role of EI at CE's macro, meso, and micro levels; and characterise CE-inducing EI in terms of targets, mechanisms and impacts. Our literature review shows that an El-driven techno-economic transition to a CE requires specific solutions, i.e. different forms of El-driven clean congruence at distinct levels of operation. Generally speaking, movement toward a CE is found to be contingent on systemic El, that is, not only intense in technology but also involving dynamic and holistic combinations of service innovations and novel organisational set-ups.

Meanwhile, industries are ever increasingly adopting service business models (i.e. servitization), so as to offer not only physical products but also services as a solution bundle to meet individual customer needs. Such convergence of both digitalization and servitization (i.e. digital servitization) has triggered an emerging IT-driven business paradigm, smart product-service systems (Smart PSS). As a novel paradigm coined in 2014, to the authors' knowledge, only 2 conference papers have provided some literature review to date, and many issues remain uncovered or not comprehensively investigated. Aiming to fill this gap, this paper has conducted a systematic review of Smart PSS or related papers published ever since its first brought up to date (30/06/2019), and selected 97 representative items together with other 37 supplementary works to summarize the tendency towards Smart PSS, its business and technical aspects, current challenges, and future perspectives. From the survey, it is found that several hybrid concerns are the key challenges faced, and self-adaptiveness with sustainability, advanced IT infrastructure, human-centric perspectives, and circular lifecycle management are the core future perspectives to explore. It is hoped that this work can attract more open discussions and provide useful insights to both academics and industries in their exploration and implementation of Smart PSS.","[Zheng, Pai; Wang, Zuoxu; Chen, Chun-Hsien; Khoo, Li Pheng] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Zheng, Pai] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Elect & Elect Engn, Delta NTU Corp Lab Cyber Phys Syst, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University; Nanyang Technological University,"Zheng, P (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Mech & Aerosp Engn, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",ericzheng@ntu.edu.sg,"Khoo, Li Pheng/A-3817-2011; Wang, Zuoxu/AAZ-2850-2020; ZHENG, PAI/K-7989-2012; Chen, Chun-Hsien/A-3877-2011","Wang, Zuoxu/0000-0003-2524-1217; ZHENG, PAI/0000-0002-2329-8634; Chen, Chun-Hsien/0000-0003-2193-5270","Delta Electronics Inc; National Research Foundation (NRF) Singapore under the Corporate Laboratory @ University Scheme at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore [RCA-16/434, SCO-RP1]","Delta Electronics Inc; National Research Foundation (NRF) Singapore under the Corporate Laboratory @ University Scheme at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore","The authors wish to acknowledge the funding support from Delta Electronics Inc and the National Research Foundation (NRF) Singapore under the Corporate Laboratory @ University Scheme (Ref.

Still, compact urban areas record low-performing rates of recyclables. Improving the recycling performance in order to recover qualitative materials, save resources and keep waste out of landfills belongs to the pressing challenges of our time. Moving towards a circular economy requires active public participation in waste management and pre-sorting of wastes at home. In the process of establishing and improving well-performing municipal solid waste management systems (MSWMS) the understanding of fundamental social factors to influence household behaviour is commonly underestimated but of utmost importance. Compiling theory and good practices from cities globally, this paper intends to support practitioners and policy makers from different backgrounds to design future strategies and interventions to motivate household waste separation behaviour. By means of an extensive literature review a general overview of the main social factors influencing household recycling behaviour is given and key motivation drivers for behavioural change are identified. Followed by a presentation of international good practices and recommendations for urban areas, special attention was given to high-density contexts. The results in combination are supposed to serve as a resource for practitioners and as a basis to develop further studies focusing on the improvement of recycling behaviour in defined urban areas and tailored to the local situation.

Future development on food waste management is expected to capitalise on the multi-functionality of products, boundary and allocation in a circular system, and trade-off between food waste and resources. With future technological advances, food waste management in circular bioeconomy policy can facilitate the accomplishment of sustainable development goals.","[Mak, Tiffany M.

However, the majority of modern companies are still based on traditional business models thus, it is important to study how to get these companies to adopt more circular practices. Data were collected through a questionnaire-based survey of 821 Italian companies. A cluster analysis was performed to classify their current level of implementation of the circular economy principles and a logit regression was carried out to identify the most effective drivers. Five clusters were identified: 1) information-oriented companies (24%), the best at communication and marketing-related activities, but the worst in relation to all the other aspects; 2) linear companies (41.6%), those that perform poorly in all five phases; 3) green marketers (15.5%), which perform well in relation to design, production and consumption; 4) optimizers (10.6%), which focus more on production and logistics and 5) circular companies (8.1%), those that register a good performance with respect to all aspects. The bad performers, clusters 1 and 2, also registered the worst economic results in the last three years, whereas the circular champions reported the best performance. Finally, the logit regression showed that economic drivers were the most effective at encouraging linear companies to adopt more circular business models. On the other hand, no significant evidence was found of any influence exerted by the drivers related to regulatory pressure, resource exploitation risks, and the pursuit of environmental values.

However, effective implementation requires a systemic change across supply chains, involving both technological and nontechnological innovations. Frameworks are beginning to emerge to foster CE thinking in organizations. However, literature review carried out as part of this research has revealed gaps in their ability to fulfil CE requirements. Furthermore, few frameworks provide support on how CE requirements may be implemented. To address these issues, this article presents a new framework, BECE (backcasting and eco-design for the circular economy), to ensure that businesses can implement CE requirements more readily. BECE empowers organizations to tackle the CE holistically by embedding the concept into corporate decision making and by bringing operational and systems thinking together, thus increasing the likelihood of successful implementation. The potential of the BECE framework was tested through a pilot workshop focusing on the development of a CE business model through redesign of products and supply chains. Using vacuum cleaners as an illustrative case study, several product design and supply-chain alternatives were identified, including the development of scenarios and action plans for their implementation at the business level. Although the case study focuses on a particular product, the BECE framework is generic and applicable across different products and business sectors.","[Mendoza, Joan Manuel F.; Gallego-Schmid, Alejandro; Azapagic, Adisa] Univ Manchester, Sustainable Ind Syst SIS Grp, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Sharmina, Maria; Heyes, Graeme] Univ Manchester, Tyndall Ctr Climate Change Res, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Mendoza, JMF (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sustainable Ind Syst, Sch Chem Engn & Analyt Sci, Sackville St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",joan.mendoza@manchester.ac.uk,"Sharmina, Maria/GWC-2144-2022; Heyes, Graeme/ABC-4844-2021; Mendoza, Joan Manuel F./F-5979-2018; Gallego Schmid, Alejandro/B-2332-2016","Heyes, Graeme/0000-0002-8073-1975; Fernandez Mendoza, Joan Manuel/0000-0003-1666-0268; Gallego Schmid, Alejandro/0000-0002-0583-2143","project Designing sustainable supply chains through the Sustainable Consumption Institute at the University of Manchester, Manchester, UK","project Designing sustainable supply chains through the Sustainable Consumption Institute at the University of Manchester, Manchester, UK","This work has been carried out as part of the project Designing sustainable supply chains funded through the Sustainable Consumption Institute at the University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.",,125,177,180,5,97,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

The reduction of food waste has been also included within the European strategy of circular economy and ambitious objectives have been assigned to the European member states. Youths proved to be the segment of the population most inclined to waste food and therefore they need to be monitored. This exploratory study, based on a survey involving 380 youths residing in Italy and Spain, aims at investigating the complexities of food waste behaviour within the framework of the Theory of Planned Behaviour. By referring to the PLS-SEM approach, we analyse the validity of the relationships between individual habits, attitudes, addiction to marketing ploys and sales strategies, and attitudes towards food waste. It also aims at verifying the existence of mediator effects in order to better understand these relationships. The construction of the Importance Performance Matrix Analysis enables identification of the dimensions which greatly influence positive behaviour, and whether urgent attention and interventions are required. The results confirm that behavioural models are appropriate for explaining youths' behaviour towards food waste with an important role played by the perceived behavioural control. Situational factors which characterize the moment of purchase should be carefully considered and monitored. This paper concludes that marketing and sale strategies negatively influence the waste behaviour of individuals, emphasizing the important role of retailers in preventing the generation of food waste.

This work applies dynamic material flow analysis to forecast production, recycling, and iron ore consumption in the Chinese steel cycle until 2100 by using steel services in terms of in-use stock per capita as driver of future. development. The whole cycle is modeled to determine possible responses of the steel industry in light of the circular economy concept. If per-capita stock saturates at 8-12 tons as evidence from industrialized countries suggests, consumption may peak between 2015 and 2020, whereupon it is likely to drop by up to 40% until 2050. A slower growing in-use stock could mitigate this peak and hence reduce overcapacity in primary production. Old scrap supply will increase substantially and it could replace up to 80% of iron ore as resource for steel making by 2050. This would require advanced recycling technologies as manufacturers of machinery and transportation equipment would have to shift to secondary steel as well as new capacities in secondary production which could, however, make redundant already existing integrated steel plants.","[Pauliuk, Stefan; Wang, Tao; Muller, Daniel B.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Pauliuk, Stefan; Wang, Tao; Muller, Daniel B.] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Hydraul & Environm Engn, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Wang, Tao] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Res Ctr Mat Cycles & Waste Management, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan",Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU); National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan,"Müller, DB (corresponding author), Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, Ind Ecol Programme, NO-7491 Trondheim, Norway.",daniel.mueller@ntnu.no,"Pauliuk, Stefan/AAC-8274-2022","Pauliuk, Stefan/0000-0002-6869-1405",,,,,33,177,197,11,203,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,WASHINGTON,"1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0013-936X,1520-5851,,ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL,Environ.

This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy.

Yet the complexity and interdependencies of such an undertaking mean that no single company can achieve it alone and ecosystem-wide orchestration is necessary. Based on a qualitative study of six large manufacturing companies (ecosystem orchestrators) and their ecosystem partners, we develop a process model that describes the scarcely understood process of ecosystem transformation toward a circular economy paradigm. We provide evidence that ecosystem orchestrators achieve the transition toward a circular economy in two stages: 1) ecosystem readiness assessment and 2) ecosystem transformation. In each stage, specific and complementary mechanisms are deployed.

As well as microplastics, chemical additives added to plastics during manufacture which may leach out upon ingestion, will enter food chains and potentially cause humans serious health problems. Regulations in many counties/regions have been setup or to be implemented to ban the production/sale and use of primary microplastics (e.g., microbeads), which could reduce microplastics in the aquatic environment in certain level. However, the fragments from larger plastic items (second microplastics) are major contributors, and then new legislations have to be proposed and implemented in order to substantially reduce the amounts of microplastics in the environment and the associated environmental impact. Moreover, approaches and measures are to be taken by encouraging companies and all users to adopt the Reduce-Reuse-Recycle circular economy as this will represent a cost-effective way of reducing the quantity of plastic objects and microplastics particles entering and gathering in the marine/aquatic environment.","[Jiang, Jia-Qian] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland",Glasgow Caledonian University,"Jiang, JQ (corresponding author), Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Sch Engn & Built Environm, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",jiaqian.jiang@gcu.ac.uk,"Jiang, Jia-Qian/O-9493-2014","Jiang, Jia-Qian/0000-0003-3607-8910",,,,,73,176,185,21,277,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-5509,,,SUSTAIN PROD CONSUMP,Sustain.

This article identifies areas where green chemistry can contribute. Substituting plastics derived from fossil resources, with bio-based alternatives from renewable resources can reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, produce plastics that are easier to recycle to the virgin polymer and, at the end of their useful life, biodegrade in the environment.

First, current terminology related to food waste was reviewed and clarified, in particular, the terms food surplus, waste and losses. This work highlights why the clarity of these definitions is crucial for the sustain ability of future food waste management systems, especially in the context of circular economy. Through a simple matrix, definitions are linked to the concepts of edibility and possibility of avoidance, leading to six distinct categories of food waste: i) edible, ii) naturally inedible (pits), iii) industrial residue, iv) inedible due to natural causes (pests), v) inedible due to ineffective management and vi) not accounted for. Category I encompasses surplus food only; category II-V food waste and category VI food losses. Based on this, an updated pyramid for food waste hierarchy is proposed, distinguishing surplus food and a new category for material recycling, in order to reflect the future food waste biorefineries in the circular bioeconomy. Nutrient and energy recovery are two separate categories and the terms recovery and recycling are clarified. Finally, a circular economy framework is presented for food surplus and waste, considering closing the loop throughout the whole food supply chain, in connection with the concept of strong and weak sustainability. This is presented along with a review of key EU policies related to food waste and examples of initiatives from the Member States. (C) 2019 Elsevier BM.

However, the analysis of the internal factors has received much less attention than the external ones. This paper aims to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the role of resources, competences, and dynamic capabilities (RCCs) as determinants (drivers and barriers) of different eco-innovation (EI) types. Those EI types contribute differently to the sustainable transition of the economy and society, that is, towards the circular economy. The statistical analyses reveal that RCCs are quite relevant as determinants of EIs, and that different RCCs are more or less relevant for different EI types. In particular, the determinants of systemic and radical EIs substantially differ from those for continuous improvements. Our results suggest that physical RCCs, involvement in green supply chains, an EI-friendly corporate culture, technology-push and market-pull, and internal financing resources represent drivers to these EIs, whereas cooperation, organizational learning, an ISO (International Organization for Standardization) ecological certification, and technological path dependency are barriers. The results may guide firms to pursue competitive and sustainable advantage by innovating through certain EI types corresponding to available and dedicated RCCs. They may also be useful to policy makers who are willing to promote specific EI types.","[Kiefer, Christoph P.; Del Rio Gonzalez, Pablo] CSIC, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, Madrid, Spain; [Carrillo-Hermosilla, Javier] Univ Alcala UAH, Inst Publ Policies & Goods IPP, Madrid, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Instituto de Politicas y Bienes Publicos (IPP); Universidad de Alcala,"González, PD (corresponding author), CSIC, C Albasanz 26-28, Madrid 28037, Spain.",pablo.delrio@csic.es,"jam, amir/O-6460-2019; Carrillo-Hermosilla, Javier/K-2453-2012","Carrillo-Hermosilla, Javier/0000-0002-5566-8847; Kiefer, Christoph P./0000-0001-5414-9714",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSO2016-74888-C4-4-R]; Chair of Corporate Social Responsibility at the University of Alcala,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Chair of Corporate Social Responsibility at the University of Alcala,"The research reported in this paper was partially funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, research grant number CSO2016-74888-C4-4-R (AEI/FEDER, UE), and by the Chair of Corporate Social Responsibility at the University of Alcala.",,135,175,182,46,486,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-4733,1099-0836,,BUS STRATEG ENVIRON,Bus.

Disruptions in supply of critical materials can have serious negative repercussions for firms, consumers, and economies. One potential set of mitigation strategies for firms dealing with criticality issues is the implementation of circular economy principles in their supply chain, operations, and end-of-life management. This work conducts a literature review combined with case study analysis to examine how certain firms assess and monitor their vulnerability to critical material supply chain issues and provides specific business examples for integrating circularity strategies. Results indicate the potential for risk reduction that could be gained from implementation of these strategies; specifically recycling, for example, can provide an in-house source (for prompt or fabrication scrap) or at least domestic source (for post-consumer scrap) for critical materials; up to 24% for the case of indium usage in China. Just in time manufacturing techniques have the potential to both exacerbate supply issues (by encouraging low inventory or needed resources for manufacturing) and improve supply issues by introducing resiliency in the supply chain indicating that approach of firms in undertaking these strategies is important. Many cases reviewed show other quantifiable secondary benefits beyond risk reduction, such as economic savings, reduction in energy consumption, and improved corporate social responsibility via enhanced supply chain oversight.","[Gaustad, Gabrielle; Krystofik, Mark; Badami, Kedar] Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 190 Lomb Mem Dr,81-2175, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Gaustad, Gabrielle; Krystofik, Mark; Badami, Kedar] Ctr Excellence Adv & Sustainable Mfg, 190 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14623 USA; [Bustamante, Michele] MIT, Mat Syst Lab, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Gaustad, G (corresponding author), Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 190 Lomb Mem Dr,81-2175, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",gabrielle.gaustad@rit.edu,"Marin, Angela Maria Azevedo Cardoso/AAJ-6892-2020; Gaustad, Gabrielle/C-2377-2012; Bustamante, Michele L/H-4851-2013; Rosa, Raquel/ACY-6683-2022",,"National Science Foundation (NSF) through CBET award [1454166]; Center of Excellence in Advanced and Sustainable Manufacturing at RIT through New York State Department of Economic Development (DED); Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering [1454166] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF) through CBET award(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)); Center of Excellence in Advanced and Sustainable Manufacturing at RIT through New York State Department of Economic Development (DED); Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys; Directorate For Engineering(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","The authors would like to acknowledge funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), through CBET award #1454166 and support from the Center of Excellence in Advanced and Sustainable Manufacturing at RIT which is supported through the New York State Department of Economic Development (DED).

Unfortunately, few literatures contribute to checking the efficiency of regional CE and exploring the potential reasons in China, which will be practically helpful in guiding China's future development and providing reference for other developing countries that will adopt CE mode. Therefore, this paper puts forward the method of super-efficiency DEA window analysis to dynamically evaluate CE efficiency of 30 regions in China covering the period of 2005-2010. In line with the features of CE, the specific efficiency of three sub-systems, namely resource saving and pollutant reducing (RSPR) sub-system, waste reusing and resource recycling (WRRR) sub-system and pollution controlling and waste disposing (PCWD) sub-system, was assessed and compared regarding time series trend and spatial distribution, based on which, the comprehensive CE efficiency was totally ranked. The results show that, on the one hand, during the period of 2005-2010, Chinese CE efficiency slightly increased, implying a significant policy effect of CE; on the other hand, the efficiency of different sub-systems varies, with RSPR sub-system the lowest, and WRRR and PCWD sub-systems relatively higher. In terms of regional distribution, the efficiency of RSPR sub-system in the east area dominates during the whole period. However, for the other two sub-systems, from 2005 to 2007, the efficiency scores of the east fluctuate, then after 2007, the east area became more efficient than the central and the west areas. Throughout the study period, the RSPR sub-system in the central area stably maintains low efficiency, and so does the WRRR sub-system in the west area. The difference in regional efficiency of three sub-systems reflects the difficulty of carrying out CE policy in China comprehensively, which means that, promoting the adaptability of regional policy for local government and enhancing the coordination among various policies for China's central government are the key concerns for realizing sustainable development.

One may initially assume that recycling processes are commendable technologies to ensure a counterbalance to LIBs manufacturing. However, the question remains whether current state-of-the-art in LIBs recycling technologies can be considered as green. This problem is due to the application of toxic chemicals or the in situ generation of harmful substances during the recycling process. Besides the potential toxicity, current solutions are accompanied with intense energy consumption, causing carbon dioxide emissions, in disagreement with the circular economy principles. This review provides a critical assessment of both published research articles and patents to derive a broad picture on the sustainability of LIBs recycling technologies. Although the efficiency of industrially applied recycling technologies can exhibit a high overall efficiency, their general process design is generally based on waste reduction and downcycling. Contrariwise, sustainable recycling of LIBs should rely on circular processes ensuring upcycling of all materials toward zero waste and minimized energy utilization. Current solutions and expected development in LIBs recycling are presented, ranging from dismantling over components separation to application of bioderived materials.","[Piatek, Jedrzej; Budnyak, Tetyana M.; Sipponen, Mika H.; Slabon, Adam] Stockholm Univ, Dept Mat & Environm Chem, Svante Arrhenius Vag 16c, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Afyon, Semih] Gebze Tech Univ, Inst Energy Technol, TR-41400 Kocaeli, Turkey; [Budnyk, Serhiy] AC2T Res GmbH, Viktor Kaplan Str 2-C, A-2700 Wiener Neustadt, Austria",Stockholm University; Gebze Technical University; AC2T Research GmbH,"Slabon, A (corresponding author), Stockholm Univ, Dept Mat & Environm Chem, Svante Arrhenius Vag 16c, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",adam.slabon@mmk.su.se,"Sipponen, Mika/AGX-5701-2022; Slabon, Adam/N-2516-2019; Sipponen, Mika/S-8874-2018; Budnyak, Tetyana/R-5326-2016","Slabon, Adam/0000-0002-4452-1831; Piatek, Jedrzej/0000-0002-1429-4586; Budnyk, Serhiy/0000-0002-2273-0456; Sipponen, Mika/0000-0001-7747-9310; Budnyak, Tetyana/0000-0003-2112-9308",Stiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmastare [198-0329]; project COMET InTribology (FFG) [872176],Stiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmastare(Swedish Research Council); project COMET InTribology (FFG),"This work was financially supported by the Stiftelsen Olle Engkvist Byggmastare (project: 198-0329).

This policy push has meanwhile been complemented by some quite ambitious national programmes for RE and CE and institutional advances but it is not yet bound to targets or mandatory reporting. Against this background, the objective of this paper is to give a comprehensive overview of the current policy frameworks at EU and a selection of MSs and provide insights into the elements shaping policy processes. The analytical framework relies on three essential interconnected components: the policy framework, the economic incentive system and economic side policies which are relevant in the context of RE and CE and actor constellations. The paper does this looking at the interface between EU-MSs. The analysis is based on different empirical surveys in which the policy development is observed and discussed (EEA 2011, 2016a, 2016b, EIO 2013, 2014, 2016) and a comprehensive review of legislative and policy frameworks at the EU and selected MSs, undertaken as part of the project POLFREE (Policy option for a Resource-Efficient Economy) (Domenech et al., 2014, Bahn-Walkowiak et al., 2014). The analysis reveals that policy frameworks for RE/CE are complex and fragmented as competing goals and visions reduce effectiveness of measures. The paper makes recommendations as to how EU and MS policies could improve RE in a coordinated way, but recognizes that achieving such coordination will be challenging in the current political context.","[Domenech, Teresa] UCL, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Bahn-Walkowiak, Bettina] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Doeppersberg 19, D-42109 Wuppertal, Germany",University of London; University College London,"Domenech, T (corresponding author), UCL, Cent House,14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",t.domenech@ucl.ac.uk; bettina.bahn-walkowiak@wupperinst.org,"Aparisi, Teresa Domenech/AAA-6137-2020","Aparisi, Teresa Domenech/0000-0002-6131-5538",European Union [308371],European Union(European Union (EU)),"The paper is based on the results of a project named Policy Options for a Resource Efficient Economy-POLFREE.

Biogas is the end product of a biological mediated process, the so called anaerobic digestion, in which different microorganisms, follow diverse metabolic pathways to decompose the organic matter. The process has been known since ancient times and was widely applied at domestic households providing heat and power for hundreds of years. Nowadays, the biogas sector is rapidly growing and novel achievements create the foundation for constituting biogas plants as advanced bioenergy factories. In this context, the biogas plants are the basis of a circular economy concept targeting nutrients recycling, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and biorefinery purposes. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art and presents future perspectives related to the anaerobic digestion process for biogas production. Moreover, a historical retrospective of biogas sector from the early years of its development till its recent advancements gives an outlook of the opportunities that are opening up for process optimisation.

Half of municipal solid waste (MSW) is materially recycled and the other half thermally treated with energy recovery. A key component of an industrial ecosystem is increasing the resource efficiency through circulating materials. Recycling rates (RRs), an indicator for the circulating behavior of materials, are often used as measure for the degree of circularity of an economy. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the recycling of paper, cardboard, aluminum, tinplate, glass, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from MSW in Switzerland by splitting the RRs into closed-and open-loop collection rate (CR) and RRs. Whereas CR refers to collected material that enters the recycling process, RRs measure the available secondary resources produced from recycling processes. For PET, the closed-loop CR of 45% and the open-loop CR of 40% compare to an RR of 31% and 37%, respectively (including exports and recycling of polyethylene and metals from collection). Official collection rates for paper and cardboard are very high (97%), whereas CR of 74% and 89% and RR of 59% and 81% for paper and cardboard, respectively, were found in the present study (including export). For a majority of the separately collected materials investigated, the rates that are determined are substantially lower than those that are officially communicated. Furthermore, given that official rates often do not provide information on the availability of secondary materials, the improvement potential for increased resource recovery is hidden.","[Haupt, Melanie] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Grp Ecol Syst Design, Inst Environm Engn, Zurich, Switzerland; [Vadenbo, Carl] Grp Ecol Syst Design, Zurich, Switzerland; [Hellweg, Stefanie] Inst Environm Engn, Grp Ecol Syst Design, Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Haupt, M (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Engn, John von Neumann Weg 9, ZH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.",haupt@ifu.baug.ethz.ch,"Hellweg, Stefanie/AAA-7756-2019; Vadenbo, Carl/I-1950-2014","Hellweg, Stefanie/0000-0001-6376-9878; Vadenbo, Carl/0000-0001-7136-2357; Haupt, Melanie/0000-0002-2869-5030",Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [NRP 70]; IRMAR project - Danish Council for Strategic Research [11-116775],Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); IRMAR project - Danish Council for Strategic Research,"This research project is part of the National Research Program Energy Turnaround (NRP 70) of the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).

This move away from the dominant linear system where products are discarded at the end of product lifecycle is deemed necessary since it is the main cause of an accelerated resource consumption. Business models are considered as a key enabler for the shift from a linear to a CE. However, research on circular business models has mainly focused on circular approaches adopted by incumbent firms, while the contributions of newly established firms (the authors call these 'circular start-ups') have been largely overlooked. This article scrutinises the business models of circular start-ups and how they may differ from those of incumbent firms embracing CE. For this, it analyses the circular business model strategies and innovations adopted by circular start-ups, relying on a novel data sample of 128 circular start-ups identified in three major CE ecosystems in Europe: the Randstad region in the Netherlands, Berlin and London. Based on this data, a novel typology of circular start-ups is proposed, distinguishing between five circular start-up archetypes: design-based, waste-based, platform-based, service-based and nature-based start-ups. The results also show that circular start-ups tend to embrace strategies corresponding to higher levels of circularity than those of incumbents. This preliminarily suggests that circular start-ups can indeed make major contributions to transitioning towards CE. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, supply chains tend to be operated without much concern for their broader contextual environment. This perspective overlooks that supply chains have become both vulnerable and harmful systems. Recent and ongoing crises have emphasized that the structures and processes of supply chains are fluid and interwoven with political-economic and planetary phenomena. Building on panarchy theory, this article reinterprets the supply chain as a social-ecological system and leaves behind a modernist view of SCM, replacing it with a more contemporary vision of dancing the supply chain. A panarchy is a structure of adaptive cycles that are linked across different levels on scales of time, space, and meaning. It represents the world's complexities more effectively than reductionist and static theories ever could, providing the basis for transformative SCM.","[Wieland, Andreas] Copenhagen Business Sch, Supply Chain Management, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Wieland, A (corresponding author), Copenhagen Business Sch, Supply Chain Management, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",,"Wieland, Andreas/Y-6546-2019","Wieland, Andreas/0000-0003-0010-4240",,,,,80,172,183,72,206,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1523-2409,1745-493X,,J SUPPLY CHAIN MANAG,J.

This review is an up-to-date discussion of the literature on the several catalytic systems that have been developed to produce LA from the different substrates. Special attention has been paid to the recent advancements on starting materials, moving from simple sugars to raw and waste biomasses.

Survey-based primary data was gathered from Brazilian industrial companies which lack regulatory clarity regarding the implementation of a CE. Our research results comprise both expected and unexpected outcomes: (i) differing from other countries, the relevance of regulatory stakeholders in Brazil could not be fully confirmed, adding complexity to the topic; (ii) unexpectedly, in this research, company owners/shareholders were the most salient stakeholders; (iii) stakeholders do indeed exert influence on how firms deal with barriers to and motivators of a CE; (iv) we found that internal barriers and internal motivators were perceived as more intense than external ones, which may create organizational tensions; (v) the adoption of a CE by firms tends to improve their sustainable performance; (vi) the previous possession of ISO 14001 and ISO 9001 certifications may control the way companies perceive the benefits of a CE.","[Jabbour, Charbel Jose Chiappetta; Jabbour, Ana Beatriz Lopes de Sousa] Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Int Business Sch, Lincoln, England; [Seuring, Stefan] Univ Kassel, Chair Supply Chain Management, D-34117 Kassel, Germany; [Jabbour, Charbel Jose Chiappetta; Jabbour, Ana Beatriz Lopes de Sousa] Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, Montpellier, France; [Jugend, Daniel; Izeppi, Wagner Colucci] Sao Paulo State Univ UNESP, Prod Engn Dept, Bauru 17033360, SP, Brazil; [Fiorini, Paula De Camargo] Fed Univ Sao Carlos UFSCar, Dept Adm, Rod Joao Leme Santos,SP 264,Km 110, Sorocaba 18052780, SP, Brazil; [Latan, Hengky] HLC Consulting, Jl Kertanegara Selatan V 5B, Semarang 50241, Indonesia",University of Lincoln; Universitat Kassel; Montpellier Business School; Universidade Estadual Paulista; Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos,"Jabbour, CJC (corresponding author), Univ Lincoln, Lincoln Int Business Sch, Lincoln, England.;Jabbour, CJC (corresponding author), Montpellier Business Sch, 2300 Ave Moulins, Montpellier, France.",c.chiappetta-jabbour@montpellier-bs.com; seuring@uni-kassel.de; a.sousa-jabbour@montpellier-bs.com; daniel.jugend@unesp.br; paula.fiorini@ufscar.br; latanhengky@gmail.com; wagnercolucciizeppi@gmail.com,"Fiorini, Paula/I-6642-2015; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Ana Beatriz/B-8966-2012; CHIAPPETTA JABBOUR, Charbel Jose/F-3505-2010; Seuring, Stefan/G-6087-2015; Jugend, Daniel/B-8850-2014","Fiorini, Paula/0000-0001-9192-9904; Lopes de Sousa Jabbour, Ana Beatriz/0000-0001-6423-8868; CHIAPPETTA JABBOUR, Charbel Jose/0000-0002-6143-4924; Seuring, Stefan/0000-0003-4204-9948; Jugend, Daniel/0000-0002-5865-7967; Latan, Hengky/0000-0002-4107-6373",,,,,87,171,172,30,169,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

To realize the vision of a circular economy, chemical recycling is advocated as a large-scale avenue to decrease fossil resource depletion and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this work, we develop a theoretical model for chemical recycling technologies assuming ideal performance. The theoretical model allows us to compute the minimal environmental impacts for chemical recycling technologies and compare them to real-case benchmark waste treatments. Thereby, we robustly identify chemical recycling technologies that will not result in environmental benefits, since their minimal environmental impacts are already higher than those of current benchmark waste treatments. In this way, we show that PET, HDPE, LDPE, PP and PS should not be recycled chemically to refinery feedstock or fuel products and rather be treated by mechanical recycling and energy recovery in cement kilns in order to reduce global warming impacts. In contrast, chemical recycling to monomers or value-added products could potentially reduce global warming impacts compared to all benchmark waste treatments by up to 4.3 kg CO2-eq per kg treated PET packaging waste. By analyzing 75 waste treatment scenarios for 5 environmental impacts, our analysis offers guidance to stakeholders involved in chemical recycling to identify the most promising as well as the least promising chemical recycling technologies.","[Meys, Raoul; Frick, Felicitas; Sternberg, Andre; Bardow, Andre] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech Thermodynam, Schinkelstr 8, D-52062 Aachen, Germany; [Westhues, Stefan; Klankermayer, Juergen] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Tech & Macromol Chem, Worringerweg 1, D-52074 Aachen, Germany; [Frick, Felicitas] HTP GmbH & Co KG, Maria Theresia Allee 35, D-52064 Aachen, Germany; [Bardow, Andre] Forschungszentrum Julich, Inst Energy & Climate Res Energy Syst Engn IEK 10, Julich, Germany; [Bardow, Andre] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Energy & Proc Syst Engn, CLA F 19-1,Tannenstr 3, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University; Helmholtz Association; Research Center Julich; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Bardow, A (corresponding author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Energy & Proc Syst Engn, CLA F 19-1,Tannenstr 3, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",abardow@ethz.ch,"; Bardow, Andre/C-5446-2009","Meys, Raoul/0000-0002-0336-9714; Sternberg, Andre/0000-0003-2873-0577; Bardow, Andre/0000-0002-3831-0691",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [033R150D],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"A.B., A.S. and R.M. would like to acknowledge funding by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF project 033R150D).",,53,170,174,31,211,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

However, estimates of both past and future development of waste and pollution are scarce. We apply compositional Bayesian regression to produce the first estimates of past and future (1965-2100) waste generation disaggregated by composition and treatment, along with resultant environmental impacts, for every country. We find that total wastes grow at declining speed with economic development, and that global waste generation has increased from 635 Mt in 1965 to 1999 Mt in 2015 and reaches 3539 Mt by 2050 (median values, middle-of-the-road scenario). From 2015 to 2050, the global share of organic waste declines from 47% to 39%, while all other waste type shares increase, especially paper. The share of waste treated in dumps declines from 28% to 18%, and more sustainable recycling, composting, and energy recovery treatments increase. Despite these increases, we estimate environmental loads to continue increasing in the future, although yearly plastic waste input into the oceans has reached a peak. Waste production does not appear to follow the environmental Kuznets curve, and current projections do not meet UN SDGs for waste reduction. Our study shows that a continuation of current trends and improvements is insufficient to reduce pressures on natural systems and achieve a circular economy. Relative to 2015, the amount of recycled waste would need to increase from 363 Mt to 740 Mt by 2030 to begin reducing unsustainable waste generation, compared to 519 Mt currently projected.","[Chen, David Meng-Chuen; Mishra, Abhijeet] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany; [Chen, David Meng-Chuen; Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon; Mishra, Abhijeet; Popp, Alexander] Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany; [Krueger, Tobias] Humboldt Univ, IRI THESys, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin; Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Humboldt University of Berlin,"Chen, DMC (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Berlin, Germany.;Chen, DMC (corresponding author), Leibniz Assoc, Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, POB 60 12 03, D-14412 Potsdam, Germany.",david.chen@pik-potsdam.de,"Popp, Alexander/N-7064-2014; Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon/ABH-9170-2020","Popp, Alexander/0000-0001-9500-1986; Bodirsky, Benjamin Leon/0000-0002-8242-6712; Chen, David Meng-Chuen/0000-0001-5939-9093; Mishra, Abhijeet/0000-0002-8287-9922; Krueger, Tobias/0000-0002-4559-6667",DAAD Study Scholarship for Graduates of All Disciplines [57381416]; SHAPE project; FORMAS (SE); FFG/BMWFW (AT); DLR/BMBF (DE) [01LS1907A-B-C]; NWO (NL); RCN (NO); European Union [776608],DAAD Study Scholarship for Graduates of All Disciplines; SHAPE project; FORMAS (SE)(Swedish Research Council Formas); FFG/BMWFW (AT); DLR/BMBF (DE); NWO (NL); RCN (NO); European Union(European Union (EU)),"We thank Perinaz Bhada-Tata, Silpa Kaza, and the entire What a Waste author team for the production and availability of their valuable dataset, as well as clarifications integral to this work.

The adoption of circular business models at a company level, which is a key element in the transition to a circular economy, has nevertheless been slow. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the barriers that hinder adoption of circular business models to facilitate circumvention of the barriers and a faster uptake. The article presents a multiple-case study of the circular business model innovation process in 12 Danish companies that includes a cross-case analysis across start-ups and incumbents and across different company sizes, industries and customer segments. The article furthermore compares the barriers derived from this empirical work to barriers found in the sustainable innovation literature. The research shows that barriers to circular business model innovation are found at all socio-technical levels and, overall, most barriers are encountered by companies at the organisational level, followed by the value chain level, the employee level and, finally, the market and institutional level. However, there are significant variation between the case companies regarding what barriers are encountered and how many in total. The cross-case analysis shows that factors other than company size, industry and customer segment affect what barriers are encountered. The comparison of empirically derived circular business model innovation barriers from the multiple-case study with barriers compiled from the broader literature on sustainable innovation shows a good correspondence between the two lists. The empirical study, nevertheless, identifies additional barriers not previously reported in the literature. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

With regard to the sample we analysed the data related to the circular business models adopted by the selected organizations, with also a focus on CE implementation at the meso levels given that it also entails the adoption of cooperation strategies between companies. The results point out that several types of organizations (companies for profit and non-profit, research centres/universities) are involved in the transition to CE with different sizes (small, medium and large) and economic sector's specializations. Recycling resulted to be, among the so called 6R practical framework, the preferred practice of most of the organizations involved over the whole supply chain, from the collection of post-consumption waste to the recovery, recycling and production of secondary raw materials. The other principles such as repair, reuse, remanufacturing are progressing well, mainly within small companies, where several laboratories deal with the reuse of products and their selling in second hand shops, or in the recovery and redistribution of food surplus and the remanufacturing of personal computers. The reuse, in particular, has constantly increased in the last five years thanks to the on-line sales. Some companies also deal with the dissemination of the CE culture (by means of different channels such as cultural events, actions and best practices to avoid plastic abuse, repair cafes, urban regeneration and urban mining projects) that includes the diffusion of all its principles and concepts such as in particular the prevention and reduction of waste and the maintenance of the value of products. In that, such companies and their activities provide with the opportunity of shifting the concept of CE beyond the current social political debate centred on recycling. Hopefully, this will contribute to unlock and promote the preventive vision of the CE. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report the successful fabrication of complex shaped prototypes from biobased acrylate photopolymer resins, employing a commercial stereolithography apparatus (SLA) 3D printer. Four distinct resins with a biobased content ranging from 34 to 67% have been developed. All formulations demonstrated adequate viscosity and were readily polymerizable by the UV-laser-based SLA process. Increasing the double-bond concentration within the resin results in stiff and thermally resilient 3D printed products. High-viscosity resins lead to high-resolution prototypes with a complex microarchitecture and excellent surface finishing, comparable to commercial nonrenewable resins. These advances can facilitate the wide application of biobased resins for construction of new sustainable products via stereolithographic 3D printing methods.","[Voet, Vincent S.

Technologies are being developed and improved to optimize the use of abundant biomass and to generate several value-added products. Efficient nutrient recovery requires additional energy-intensive steps for effective valorization. Moreover, appropriate waste collection and pretreatment practices increase the degree of valorization. The use of biomass waste in biorefineries has significant potential to yield biofuels and organic fertilizers. Further research and development are required to develop effective biorefining technologies to enable the efficient exploitation of bioresources. Greater consideration should be applied to energy pathways to support this technology. Therefore, there is a demand for innovation in the integrated biorefining approach in response to changing markets, and novel commercial models should be introduced into the circular economy.","[Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar; Awasthi, Sanjeev Kumar; Liu, Tao; Duan, Yumin; Zhang, Zengqiang] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar; Taherzadeh, Mohammad J.] Univ Boras, Swedish Ctr Resource Recovery, S-50190 Boras, Sweden; [Pandey, Ashok] CSIR Indian Inst Toxicol Res, Ctr Innovat & Translat Res, Lucknow 226001, Uttar Pradesh, India; [Jain, Archana; Pandey, Ashok] Yonsei Univ, Frontier Res Lab, Seoul, South Korea; [Sarsaiya, Surendra] Zunyi Med Univ, Key Lab Basic Pharmacol, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Sarsaiya, Surendra] Zunyi Med Univ, Minist Educ, Joint Int Res Lab Ethnomed, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Patel, Anil] Korea Univ, Dept Chem & Biol Engn, Seoul, South Korea; [Juneja, Ankita] Univ Illinois & Urbana Champaign, Dept Agr & Biol Engn, 1304 W Penn Ave, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Singh, Rajendra Prasad] Southeast Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Yan, Binghua] Hunan Agr Univ, Coll Resources & Environm, Changsha 410128, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; University of Boras; Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) - India; CSIR - Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR); Yonsei University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Korea University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Southeast University - China; Hunan Agricultural University,"Awasthi, MK (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Nat Resources & Environm, Yangling 712100, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",mukesh_awasthi45@yahoo.com,"Taherzadeh, Mohammad J./B-5950-2009; Pandey, Ashok/JBR-8714-2023; Juneja, Ankita/HJY-7942-2023; Yan, Binghua/ACD-0393-2022; Singh, Rajendra Prasad/AAO-2643-2021; Patel, Anil Kumar Kumar/HJY-0453-2023; Zhang, Zengqiang/J-3167-2014; Pandey, Ashok/AAC-6340-2019; Sarsaiya, Surendra/K-6970-2019; Taherzadeh, Mohammad/AAM-5414-2021; Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar/P-8297-2017; Patel, Anil Kumar/K-4607-2015","Taherzadeh, Mohammad J./0000-0003-4887-2433; Pandey, Ashok/0000-0003-1626-3529; Juneja, Ankita/0000-0002-6784-7906; Yan, Binghua/0000-0003-3255-6559; Singh, Rajendra Prasad/0000-0002-6597-9737; Zhang, Zengqiang/0000-0002-6860-9328; Pandey, Ashok/0000-0003-1626-3529; Sarsaiya, Surendra/0000-0002-0850-8592; Taherzadeh, Mohammad/0000-0003-4887-2433; Awasthi, Mukesh Kumar/0000-0003-0879-184X; Patel, Anil Kumar/0000-0002-7129-7548","Shaanxi introduced talent research funding, Shaanxi, China [A279021901]; The Introduction of Talent Research Start-up Fund [Z101021904]; College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest AAMP;F University, Yangling, Shaanxi Province, China; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant at University of Boras, Boras, Sweden [754412]; National Natural Science Foundation of China, China [51650410657]; School of Civil Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Distinguished HighLevel Talents Research Grant from Guizhou Science and Technology Corporation Platform Talents Fund [CK-1130-002, [2017]5733-001]; Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China; Mobility for Regional Excellence-2020 [UN 2017-00771]","Shaanxi introduced talent research funding, Shaanxi, China; The Introduction of Talent Research Start-up Fund; College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest AAMP;F University, Yangling, Shaanxi Province, China; European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant at University of Boras, Boras, Sweden(European Union (EU)); National Natural Science Foundation of China, China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); School of Civil Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; Distinguished HighLevel Talents Research Grant from Guizhou Science and Technology Corporation Platform Talents Fund; Zunyi Medical University, Zunyi, China; Mobility for Regional Excellence-2020","This work was supported by a research fund from Shaanxi introduced talent research funding, Shaanxi, China (A279021901); and The Introduction of Talent Research Start-up Fund (Grant No. Z101021904), College of Natural Resources and Environment, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi Province 712100, China.

This condition calls for strategic planning based on the expected long-term demand and supply of these metals and the implications attached. Here, we provide the first systematic review of studies (88 studies in all) exploring the projected long-term status of various critical materials, covering 48 elements with 546 data points for global demand through 2030 and 2050. Interestingly, results indicate that, to date, no long-term demand outlook is available for some high criticality metals. We also find that the social and environmental implications induced by demand growth are largely overlooked in these studies, resulting in less attention being given to the spatial divergence between consuming and producing countries in the global supply chain. Moreover, circular economy strategies that include component reuse and remanufacturing have been barely incorporated into the modelling frameworks presented in these studies, while end-of-life recycling is heavily focused on. In addition, elemental linkages (e.g., indium-zinc-steel) are underemphasized, leading to a lack of understanding of future availability and sustainable cycles. All of these findings affirm the need for further scientific research that explores the long-term status of critical metals, which strongly connects to the sustainable development goals of the United Nations and implementation of the Paris Agreement.","[Watari, Takuma; Nansai, Keisuke; Nakajima, Kenichi] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Mat Cycles & Waste Management Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan; [Watari, Takuma] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Frontier Sci, 5-1-5 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba 2778563, Japan; [Nansai, Keisuke] Univ Sydney, Fac Sci, Sch Phys, ISA, Camperdown, NSW 2006, Australia",National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; University of Tokyo; University of Sydney,"Watari, T (corresponding author), Natl Inst Environm Studies, Ctr Mat Cycles & Waste Management Res, 16-2 Onogawa, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3058506, Japan.",watari.takuma@nies.go.jp,"Watari, Takuma/AAT-7126-2021; Nakajima, Kenichi/AAQ-3768-2021; Nansai, Keisuke/C-2516-2008; Watari, Takuma/AAT-7722-2021","Watari, Takuma/0000-0002-6072-3679; Nakajima, Kenichi/0000-0002-7241-7695; Nansai, Keisuke/0000-0002-2449-1874; Watari, Takuma/0000-0002-6072-3679","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology [19K24391, 18KT0056, 18KT0010]; Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan [2-1801]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19K24391, 18KT0056, 18KT0010] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Environment Research and Technology Development Fund of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Research (No. 19K24391, 18KT0056 and 18KT0010) from the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology and by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (2-1801) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan.

In this study hard plastic, plastic film and PVC waste collected at three Danish recycling centres were sampled and characterised according to product applications, legislative requirements (quality), expected product life time, polymer types and presence of potential impurities such as coloured plastics, non-plastic materials and multi-polymer products. The obtained information was applied for estimation of overall recycling potentials for selected archetype recycling process chains based on material flow analysis. In addition to providing detailed data for the composition of the plastic waste products, the results showed that impurities represented 28% (wet weight) of the plastic waste, and that about 75% of the plastic waste was characterised as Low Quality applications, indicating some legislative recovery restrictions. By accounting for the level/type of impurities, the overall recycling potential was found to be 52% for hard plastics, 59% for plastic films and 79% for PVC waste. The results showed that while varying according to polymer type, the recyclability of High Quality plastic waste was 12-35% higher than Low Quality applications. While actual results are representative of Danish conditions, the study demonstrates that detailed characteristics of plastic waste are needed to identify potential challenges to recycling and thereby potentially improving the design (and recovery efficiency) of recycling facilities.

However, solid and liquid organic wastes have inherent energy and value, and similar as waste CO2 gas they can be reused to produce value-added chemicals and materials. There has been a paradigm shift towards developing a closed loop, biorefinery approach for the valorization of these wastes into value-added products, and such an approach enables a more carbon-efficient and circular economy. This review quantitatively analyzes the state-of-the-art of the emerging microbial electrochemical technology (MET) platform and provides critical perspectives on research advancement and technology development. The review offers side-by-side comparison between microbial electrosynthesis (MES) and electro-fermentation (EF) processes in terms of principles, key performance metrics, data analysis, and microorganisms. The study also summarizes all the processes and products that have been developed using MES and EF to date for organic waste and CO2 valorization. It finally identifies the technological and economic potentials and challenges on future system development. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

CE acts as alternative solutions to the dominant linear economic model of production and consumption. The incorporation of the CE into supply chain management is known as circular supply chain management (CSCM). The objective of this study is to conduct a state-of-art review of CSCM using content analysis methodology. This review covers the available circular supply chain literature, highlights the research trends, gaps and set up the potential research directions for future studies. Total 125 CSCM articles published in journals covering the span of last one decade (2010 to July 2019) are selected. The CSCM research articles are evaluated and segregated in 13 pre-defined structural dimensions and analytics. The result shows that there exist ample scope and open doors for the growth of CSCM which should be investigated with the help of advanced quantitative modeling approaches, highly developed optimization techniques, integrated multi-criteria decision making techniques, and proficient algorithms. Also, CSCM research needs to recognize enablers/drivers/critical success factors, barriers/obstacles, new circular business models and innovative frameworks. Therefore, this examination will prop up new opportunities for researchers to figure out the novel dimensions in the field of CSCM. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Sensors in smart homes are able to interconnect devices such as thermostats, washing machines, television sets, laptops, tablets, and other objects to the Internet of Things platforms. New digital technologies have introduced important innovations in factories, hospitals, hotels, cities and territories. Industry 4.0 is signaling the end of well-established patterns and is asking scholars, managers and citizens willing to survive in this ever-changing and increasingly complex environment to observe it through different lenses and new paradigms. The tourism sector, also, is very much involved in digital transformations, increasingly qualifying them with expressions such as Tourism 4.0 or Smart Tourism. What impact does the digital revolution have on tourism? What do tourism 4.0 and smart tourism have in common? What are the main differences? Adopting a conceptual approach and focusing on the travel and tourism industry, our work aims to provide a point of view and some preliminary answers to the above questions. In paragraph 1 we illustrate the main changes brought about by the digital revolution 4.0 in industry, the Web, and tourism. Then, the concepts of tourism 4.0 and smart tourism are compared in Sect. 2. Section 3 illustrates how the consumer experience of digital tourists changes before, during, and after the trip. Paragraphs 4 and 5 illustrate the challenges of tourism destinations and tourism ecosystems in the smart perspective. In the final section of the paper, we highlight that in the near future it will not be possible for tourism ecosystems and territories to only take into account digital innovations, but they will have to include smart tourism perspectives like sustainability, circular economy, quality of life, and social value; they should also aim to enhance tourism experiences and to increase the competitive advantage of smart tourism destinations.

Developments in Europe, despite having attracted less attention in the literature, have been significant, driven both by public and private initiative. This paper provides an updated overview of IS activity in Europe, with a mapping of key networks, and a study of prevailing typologies of networks, size, geographical distribution and main streams/resources traded. The analysis is based on a combination of desk research, gathering of primary data from case studies, a survey to IS network facilitators (n = 22) and in-depth interviews and focus groups (3) with IS practitioners, policy officers and industry representatives (n = 25). The analysis identified pockets of IS activity across all Europe, although varying in nature, resources exchanged and scale and scope of the initiatives. The average size of the mapped networks is approx. 473 members, but the median is approx. 100 members, which indicates high variability of sizes. The geographical scope of the synergies also seems to be dependent upon the following factors: 1) the type of waste stream/by-product; 2) transport costs and 3) market value of secondary materials. Types of waste streams exchanged common to most networks, are chemicals (e.g. chemical base products), biomass and agriculture by-products, wood and wood pellets, plastics, reusable construction materials, equipment, inert waste and water (different qualities including industrial water), residual heat and steam. The paper also discusses key obstacles facing IS development in Europe highlighting: 1) weakness of economic incentives given the low margin of IS projects associated to undeveloped secondary markets; 2) geographical variation of incentives and drivers, given differences in policy frameworks and support mechanisms (e.g. landfill tax levels) and 3) legislative issues that make transport over geographic boundaries extremely complex and administratively burdensome. Finally, the paper concludes with a general discussion of the potential of IS to contribute to the transition to the circular economy (CE) in Europe and identifies some key areas of future research.","[Domenech, Teresa; Bleischwitz, Raimund; Panayotopoulos, Dimitris] UCL, London, England; [Doranova, Asel; Roman, Laura] Technopolis Grp, Brussels, Belgium",University of London; University College London,"Domenech, T (corresponding author), UCL, London, England.",t.domenech@ucl.ac.uk,"Bleischwitz, Raimund/JJF-2415-2023; Panayotopoulos-Tsiros, Dimitrios/AAE-7804-2022; Aparisi, Teresa Domenech/AAA-6137-2020","Bleischwitz, Raimund/0000-0001-8164-733X; Panayotopoulos-Tsiros, Dimitrios/0000-0003-4101-9608; Aparisi, Teresa Domenech/0000-0002-6131-5538; Doranova, Asel/0000-0001-5831-5601","European Commission, DG Growth [409/PP/2014/FC Lot 3]","European Commission, DG Growth","The paper is based on the results of the European Commission project Cooperation fostering industrial symbiosis: market potential, good practice and policy actions.

Currently, the main focus in centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) lies on struvite recovery routes, land application of sludge or on technologies that rely on sludge incineration. These routes have several disadvantages. Our study shows that the mineral vivianite, Fe-2(PO4)(3) x 8H(2)O, is present in digested sludge and can be the major form of phosphate in the sludge. Thus, we suggest vivianite can be the nucleus for alternative phosphate recovery options. Excess and digested sewage sludge was sampled from full-scale MWTPs and analysed using x-ray diffraction (XRD), conventional scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), environmental SEM-EDX (eSEM-EDX) and Mossbauer spectroscopy. Vivianite was observed in all plants where iron was used for phosphate removal. In excess sludge before the anaerobic digestion, ferrous iron dominated the iron pool (>= 50%) as shown by Mossbauer spectroscopy. XRD and Mossbauer spectroscopy showed no clear correlation between vivianite bound phosphate versus the iron content in excess sludge. In digested sludge, ferrous iron was the dominant iron form (>85%). Phosphate bound in vivianite increased with the iron content of the digested sludge but levelled off at high iron levels. 70-90% of all phosphate was bound in vivianite in the sludge with the highest iron content (molar Fe:P = 2.5). The quantification of vivianite was difficult and bears some uncertainty probably because of the presence of impure vivianite as indicated by SEM-EDX. eSEM-EDX indicates that the vivianite occurs as relatively small (20-100 mu m) but free particles. We envisage very efficient phosphate recovery technologies that separate these particles based on their magnetic properties from the complex sludge matrix. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is a form of collaborative supply chain management aiming to make industry more sustainable and achieve collective benefits based on utilization of waste, by-products, and excess utilities between economically independent industries. Based on an extensive analysis of published studies on existing IS collaborations and interviews with central stakeholders of a comprehensive IS, this paper investigates IS from a supply chain collaboration perspective. A theoretical framework is built and used to discuss how industrial symbiosis pursues sustainability and to identify the main collaboration aspects and performance impacts. This framework is then used in the analysis of selected published cases. Based on this, we derive propositions on the organizational and operational requirements for collaboration in the context of IS networks, related to the supply chain integration and coordination practices. As IS has only received little attention in the operations and supply chain management community, our propositions directly lead to future research directions. Furthermore, the analysis in this paper provides directions to increase the feasibility and resource efficiency of IS networks and can hence be used by stakeholders involved in these networks.

Ecological modernization at the society level is influenced by restructuring policies and regulations. Some of these policies and regulations in China are focusing on enhancing energy savings and pollution reduction (ESPR). Based on a survey of 376 responses, we investigate whether different Chinese manufacturer clusters varying in their extent of implementing GSCM exist from this ecological modernization perspective. We also examine if Chinese manufacturers' awareness of domestic and international environmental ESPR-oriented compliance is related to GSCM implementation and whether a mediating effect of regulatory pressure plays a significant role. The results highlight the varying pace of Chinese manufacturers to ecologically modernize with GSCM practices and the significance of regulatory pressure to diffuse the practices adoption by Chinese manufacturing industry. Implications of this research go beyond the manufacturers investigated in this study where similar occurrence of these relationships may exist in other regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The growing popularity of the concept is accompanied by some definitional ambiguities and conceptual uncertainties. In particular, the relationship and contribution of CE to sustainable development (SD) and thus to a more sustainable society is currently under discussion. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this discussion by providing new insights into the evolution and state of CE research over the past two decades, in general, and its sustainability connotation, in particular. For doing so, a mixed-methods approach was adopted that combines a longitudinal bibliographic network analysis, multiple correspondence analysis and k-means clustering, correlated topic modeling, historiographic citation analysis and a semantic content analysis. The results indicate that the CE literature body can be divided into management and technically-oriented studies that have either a beginning-of-life or an end-of-life focus. Recycling is the most referred to R-strategy, followed by remanufacturing, repair and reuse, which, however, occur one order of magnitude less frequently. CE research and SD were found to exhibit a subset relationship, as only a limited number of environmental aspects is directly addressed. Social aspects form a periphery. The qualitative analysis further portraits the conceptual evolution of the CE-SD relationship between 2000 and 2019 by following the citation network of the 30 most influential CE papers. The results contribute to positioning CE research within the general Sustainable Development debate and to identifying potential, sustainability-related shortcomings and blind spots.","[Schoeggl, Josef-Peter; Stumpf, Lukas; Baumgartner, Rupert J.] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Christian Doppler Lab Sustainable Prod Management, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Schöggl, JP (corresponding author), Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Inst Syst Sci Innovat & Sustainabil Res, Christian Doppler Lab Sustainable Prod Management, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",josef.schoeggl@uni-graz.at,"Schöggl, Josef-Peter/AAE-1028-2021; Baumgartner, Rupert/AAR-8657-2021; Schöggl, Josef-Peter/K-8760-2018","Schöggl, Josef-Peter/0000-0002-4273-9490; Baumgartner, Rupert/0000-0003-0956-7997; Stumpf, Lukas/0000-0003-4234-1332","Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Christian Doppler Research Association","Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development; Christian Doppler Research Association","The financial support of the Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs, the National Foundation for Research, Technology and Development, and the Christian Doppler Research Association, is gratefully acknowledged.",,81,165,169,24,102,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

There is a growing school of thought that suggests product design should be an important step in the recycling process. While this review is aimed specifically at one technological product, it contains facets that are applicable to the recycling of any complex product. Decarbonisation of energy production necessitates a proliferation of efficient electrical storage and a significant proportion of this, particularly in automotive propulsion, will use lithium ion batteries. The scale of the projected electric vehicle market means that a circular economy model needs to be established while the scale of end-of-life product is still manageable to prevent a build-up of hazardous waste. This critical review investigates the issues of lithium ion battery recycling and discusses the aspects of pack, module and cell design that can simplify battery dismantling and recycling. It highlights not only Green aspects of elemental recovery, but also technoeconomic features which may govern the appropriate direction for recycling.

We will posit that circularity needs to be understood as a property of a system (e.g., the mobility system of a city), rather than a property of an individual product or service (e.g., a car or a car-sharing service). Hence, there is a need for more knowledge on how to innovate towards 'circular ecosystems'. This study proposes a set of principles for 'circular ecosystem innovation', based on: 1) a concise literature review to retrieve recommended principles on how to successfully innovate in ecosystems, 2) a mobility case of circular ecosystem innovation to investigate how relevant and useful these principles are for circular oriented innovation. The case data include 20 interviews, workshop data and internal background documents. The identified principles can be categorized in three groups: 1) collaboration (i.e., how firms can interact with other organizations in their ecosystem to innovate towards circularity), 2) experimentation (i.e., how firms can organize a structured trial-and-error process to implement greater circularity) and 3) platformization (i.e., how firms can organize social and economic interactions via online platforms to achieve greater circularity). Future research may focus on identifying opportunities and barriers to applying these principles in different contexts than in the one that is investigated in the present study.

Nevertheless, bioeconomy and circular economy concepts is much more recent and has motivated a regain of interest of dedicated research to improve production modes and expand potential uses. Accordingly, this review paper aims essentially at outlining recent breakthroughs obtained in the field of furfural production from sugars and polysaccharides feedstocks. The review discusses advances obtained in major production pathways recently explored splitting in the following categories: (i) non-catalytic routes like use of critical solvents or hot water pretreatment, (ii) use of various homogeneous catalysts like mineral or organic acids, metal salts or ionic liquids, (iii) feedstock dehydration making use of various solid acid catalysts; (iv) feedstock dehydration making use of supported catalysts, (v) other heterogeneous catalytic routes. The paper also briefly overviews current understanding of furfural chemical synthesis and its underpinning mechanism as well as safety issues pertaining to the substance.

Dimensions associated with organizational culture (e.g., attitudes, norms, assumptions) give a sense of identity and determine behavior. The latter include general approaches concerning the organizational impact on the natural environment (environmental sustainability) or the adoption of digital technologies (digitalization), which can cause profound transformations of the business model. These three concepts have been investigated separately and scarce attention has been paid to their relationship. To enable SMEs to successfully manage this complex relationship, our study cumulates existing knowledge, offering the first integrative view on organizational culture, level of environmental sustainability, and level of digitalization and their interactions. Through a systematic literature review protocol supplemented where possible by meta-analysis we selected 80 significant papers out of 811 peer-reviewed papers analyzed. We developed a network map to display the relations between the three concepts. Quantitative path analysis was used on three bidirectional main paths. For qualitative analysis we developed a novel extension to the Belief-Action-Outcome (BAO) framework, presented for the first time in the paper. Our findings reveal thirteen key dimensions and identify ten links between the key constructs. Strategic orientation, internal capabilities, management, and attitudes are the most investigated cultural dimensions. Furthermore, we integrated interchangeably used terms (e.g. Green IT and Green IS) introducing the novel concept of green digitalization tools. The meta-analysis revealed trends in applied research methods, geographical locations of research, top journals, and a growing interest in the relationship. Finally, we identify gaps in existing research and challenges for future research. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Manufacturing is under pressure to achieve cost and environmental impact reductions, as manufacturing becomes more integrated and complex. Cloud manufacturing offers a solution, as it is capable of making intelligent decisions to provide the most sustainable and robust manufacturing route available. Although CM research has progressed, a consensus is still lacking on the concepts within CM as well 'as applications and scope beyond discrete manufacturing. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how CM offers a more sustainable manufacturing future to the industry as a whole, before focusing specifically on the application to process manufacturing (e.g. food, pharmaceuticals and chemicals). This paper details the definitions, characteristics, architectures and previous case studies on CM. From this, the fundamental aspects of the CM concept are identified, along with an analysis of how the concept has progressed. A new, comprehensive CM definition is formulated by combining key concepts drawn from previous definitions and emphasizes CM potential for sustainable manufacturing. Four key methods of how CM increases sustainability are identified: (1) collaborative design; (2) greater automation; (3) improved process resilience and (4) enhanced waste reduction, reuse and recovery. The first two key methods are common to both discrete and process manufacturing, however key methods (3) and (4) are more process manufacturing specific and application of CM for these has yet to be fully realised. Examples of how CM's characteristics may be utilised to solve various process manufacturing problems are presented to demonstrate the applications of CM to process manufacturing. Waste is an important consideration in manufacturing, with strong sustainability implications. The current focus has been on using CM for waste minimisation; however, process manufacturing offers waste as a resource (valorisation opportunities from diversifying co-products, reuse, recycle and energy recovery). Exploring CM's potential to characterise and evaluate alternative process routes for the valorisation of process manufacturing waste is considered for the first time. The specific limitations preventing CM adoption by process manufacturers are discussed. Finally, CM's place in the future of manufacturing is explored, including how it will interact with, and complement other emerging manufacturing technologies to deliver a circular economy and personalised products.

CP was the reply of the industry to the call for sustainable development as launched by the WCED (1987) and further elaborated in Rio's Agenda 21 (UN, 1992). During the past 25 years, the concept was put in practice. During this period it changed in scope, methods, and application area. This provided a deeper socioeconomic impact to an idea that was originally launched to awaken industry on its environmental responsibilities. This paper provides a review of essentials that contributed to the fundamental changes in CP during the most recent quarter of a century. It takes off with a review of CP definitions illustrating the changes of the content. Changes in scope are exemplified with the increasing importance of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This includes that post-modern companies have not only responsibilities on their economic performance and the environment, but should also act on issues including human rights and resources, business ethics, and community involvement. The links between CP and green and circular economy are indicated. The CP approach is increasingly applied outside the industry. CP for sustainable tourism is discussed in more detail but is only an example of the wider application in e.g. agriculture or health services. This widening of contents necessitates more and better-adapted methods supporting the measurement of the CP components. Indicators, assessment strategies, and green accounting are increasingly improved and used more specifically and frequently. This evolution is discussed in a context of a dilution of the original environmental targets in a wider, more societal scope and the transition towards a more responsible, proactive and reliable management of the sectors applying CP.

Anaerobic processes are able to treat efficiently organic wastes, producing at the same time different value-added compounds. In addition, due to the lower costs and environmental impacts associated with these processes when compared to other options, they are among the most promising technologies for food waste treatment. This article reviews the state-of-the-art dealing with treatment of food waste by anaerobic processes, with emphasis on the most recent research carried out. The different processes that are assessed are anaerobic digestion for methane production, anaerobic fermentation for hydrogen and/or volatile fatty acids production and 2-stage systems. The primary issues associated with each alternative are presented, paying special attention to accumulation of ammonia and volatile fatty acids in the reactor. In addition, the latest developments to overcome the complications of each system are also described, focusing on how they improve its stability and performance. Moreover, the relevant economic and environmental research has also been reviewed, including several life cycle analyses that compare anaerobic processes with other technologies used for food waste treatment. Different case studies are also presented. Finally, recommendations for future research for the anaerobic processes studied and options for process integration are discussed. Moving towards the idea of a circular economy, a potential biorefinery for food waste valorization is also proposed.","[Capson-Tojo, Gabriel; Steyer, Jean-Philippe; Delgenes, Jean-Philippe; Escudie, Renaud] INRA, LBE, 102 Ave Etangs, F-11100 Narbonne, France; [Capson-Tojo, Gabriel; Rouez, Maxime; Crest, Marion] CIRSEE, Suez, 38 Rue President Wilson, F-78230 Le Pecq, France",INRAE,"Escudié, R (corresponding author), INRA, LBE, 102 Ave Etangs, F-11100 Narbonne, France.",renaud.escudie@supagro.inra.fr,"Capson Tojo, Gabriel/E-3471-2017","Capson Tojo, Gabriel/0000-0001-6484-8199; Escudie, Renaud/0000-0003-0736-0327; Steyer, Jean-Philippe/0000-0003-0467-8081",Suez; National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRA) under the CIFRE [2014/1146]; Communaute d'Agglomeration du Grand Narbonne (CAGN),Suez; National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRA) under the CIFRE; Communaute d'Agglomeration du Grand Narbonne (CAGN),This research has been financed by Suez and by the National Institute of Agronomic Research (INRA) under the CIFRE convention No. 2014/1146.

An international workshop for 3R and waste management policymakers was held in Kyoto, Japan, and a bibliographic survey was also conducted to collect data. 3R policies are clearly given priority in the hierarchy of waste management in every country studied. Thermal recovery, which includes power generation from waste heat and methane gas collected from organic waste, is also a priority; this is consistent with the increased use of countermeasures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In the EU, waste management is characterized by practical and effective 3R policies through the development of realistic regulations and by the policymakers' desire to simplify management systems. The policy ideal in China, however, is the development of a circular economy that targets reductions in the amount and hazardousness of waste. Limits on the number of final disposal sites, strategies for procuring resources, and GHG emission countermeasures are closely linked with 3R policies, and further development of 3R policies in parallel with such issues is expected.","[Sakai, Shin-ichi; Hirai, Yasuhiro; Asari, Misuzu] Kyoto Univ, Environm Preservat Res Ctr, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Yoshida, Hideto] Japan Environm Safety Corp, Tokyo, Japan; [Takigami, Hidetaka] Natl Inst Environm Studies, Res Ctr Mat Cycles & Waste Management, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan; [Takahashi, Shin] Ehime Univ, Ctr Marine Environm Studies, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan; [Tomoda, Keijirou] Towa Technol, Hiroshima, Japan; [Peeler, Maria Victoria] Washington State Dept Ecol, Olympia, WA USA; [Wejchert, Jakub] European Commiss, Sect Unit G4, DG Environm, Brussels, Belgium; [Schmid-Unterseh, Thomas] Fed Minist Environm, Div Prod Responsibil Avoidance Recovery & Utiliza, Berlin, Germany; [Douvan, Aldo Ravazzi] Minist Environm Land & Sea, Italian Environm Author EU Struct Funds, Rome, Italy; [Hathaway, Roy] Dept Environm Food & Rural Affairs, Waste Management Div, London, England; [Hylander, Lars D.] Uppsala Univ, Dept Earth Sci Air & Water Sci, Uppsala, Sweden; [Fischer, Christian] European Top Ctr Sustainable Consumpt & Prod, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Oh, Gil Jong] Natl Inst Environm Res, Resource Recirculat Ctr, Inchon, South Korea; [Li Jinhui] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Ngo Kim Chi] VAST, Hanoi, Vietnam","Kyoto University; National Institute for Environmental Studies - Japan; Ehime University; Uppsala University; National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER), Republic of Korea; Tsinghua University; Vietnam Academy of Science & Technology (VAST)","Sakai, S (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Environm Preservat Res Ctr, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",sakai@eprc.kyoto-u.ac.jp,"Hylander, Lars/ABA-9862-2021; Hirai, Yasuhiro/ACM-2851-2022","Hirai, Yasuhiro/0000-0002-0178-2089; Sakai, Shin-ichi/0000-0002-8644-8425",,,,,53,163,177,4,105,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1438-4957,,,J MATER CYCLES WASTE,J.

This concept and its application have also been the topic of extensive research. Up till now, this work lacks a more comprehensive theoretical framework, and this paper fills this gap. We provide a theoretical basis for understanding the dynamics through which regional industrial systems change their connectiveness in an attempt to reduce their ecological impact. We position our framework within the field of industrial symbiosis based on a comprehensive literature search in the ISI Web of Science database for publications that listed 'industrial symbiosis', 'eco-industrial park', or a combination of 'industrial-ecology' and 'regional' as a topic. The framework conceptualizes industrial symbiosis as a process at two levels: (1) the level of the regional industrial system (RIS), and (2) the societal level where the concept and routines of industrial symbiosis diffuse. We link the dynamics at these levels to changes in ecological impact and increase in institutional capacity. We conclude with a research agenda based on the variables and their basic relationships specified in our framework. The main line of research we propose is to systematically investigate how institutional capacity evolves over time in regional industrial systems and how it affects the ecological impact of such systems. We also propose to investigate how insights from existing literature about stimulating and impeding factors to industrial symbiosis can be understood in terms of mechanisms of transmission and how these mechanisms interact to create nationally distinct patterns of diffusion of industrial symbiosis.

'Lean thinking' has evolved as a popular business strategy for SMEs to achieve sustainable business practice, addressing the need for efficiency in production and waste reduction. In this study we explore the co-evolution of 'lean and green thinking' and the potential for lean and green practices to enable successful transitions to sustainable business practice. Focusing on investigations into manufacturing SMEs in Queensland, Australia, we first establish four key enablers and six key barriers to sustainable business practice, derived from a series of in-depth interviews with Chief Executive Officers and senior managers involved in sustainability and lean manufacturing. We offer an institutional theory perspective on these findings, concluding the potential for normative, coercive and mimetic drivers to influence SMEs to shape environmental, social and economic decision making and legitimize the transition to sustainable business practice. We then present a novel 'Model of strategic enablers of sustainable business practice' to guide SMEs to intentionally use their lean and green strategies to successfully adopt sustainable business outcomes. We propose that through adopting lean and green thinking to transition to sustainable business practice, SMEs can more rapidly contribute to the circular economy at the level of firm. Agencies and professional bodies can support SMEs in this transition through targeted interventions that address the enablers and barriers presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12.3, countries committed to halve per-capita food waste generated at retail and consumer levels and to decrease food waste along the food supply chain by 2030. Reliable and detailed information on food waste is of utmost importance for the actors of the food supply chain, organizations and governments willing to implement and monitor effective reduction strategies. The present paper is a review of existing studies on food waste generation at the global and European scales and aims primarily at describing and comparing the approaches adopted, and secondarily at analysing their potential in supporting food waste related European interventions and policies. Ten studies were selected among relevant scientific papers and grey literature and their underlying quantification methodologies were systematically analysed. Methodological elements discussed in the paper include type of waste streams captured by estimations, distinction between edible and inedible food waste along the agro-food supply chain, reported units of measure, overall inefficiencies of the food system, and uncertainty of data. Current estimations of food loss and waste generation range between 194-389 kg per person per year at the global scale, and between 158-298 kg per person per year at the European scale. However, further efforts are needed to improve their level of detail and reliability and to foster their support to food loss and waste-related strategies. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

A return to pre-pandemic growth patterns will take time and depend on the depth and extent of the recession sparked by COVID-19. The recovery phase will overlap with global efforts to deal with the evolving climate crisis. For the tourism industry to thrive in a future world it must look beyond the temptation of adopting strategies based on a return to the pre-COVID-19 normal of the past and instead seek to understand how it should respond to the emerging transformation of the global economy to carbon neutrality. Many of the lessons that emerged from the pandemic can be applied to strategies to deal with climate change. Of most interest is the success of strategies such as flattening the curve. Application of similar strategies plus adoption of the circular economy model to wind back Green House Gas emissions will help avert the global environmental disaster that will occur if global temperatures continue to increase. These strategies point to what a future carbon-neutral economic production system might look like, the path to which could offer the tourism industry numerous opportunities to transform from the current model that favours a high resource consumption model to one that is environmentally friendly and resource neutral.","[Prideaux, Bruce; Thompson, Michelle; Pabel, Anja] Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Business & Law, Cairns, Australia",Central Queensland University,"Prideaux, B (corresponding author), Cent Queensland Univ, Sch Business & Law, Cairns, Australia.",b.prideaux@cqu.edu.au,"Thompson, Michelle/AAU-8526-2021","Thompson, Michelle/0000-0002-7909-3523; Pabel, Anja/0000-0003-1409-5496",,,,,39,161,164,6,131,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1461-6688,1470-1340,,TOURISM GEOGR,Tour.

In so doing, we employ Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR) and Fully Modified OLS (FMOLS) approaches on data from 1990 to 2014 in a STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) framework. Key empirical results indicate that these factors may contribute to environmental improvement in the short run; however, there are adverse implications in the long-run. Specifically, economic factors including economic growth, trade openness and foreign direct investment cause environmental degradation in the under-analysis economies. The sociological factors as measured by the population growth and the level of urbanization also show a negative impact on the environmental degradation in the short-run but in the long run, both population size and urbanization increase environmental degradation. These findings are in line with the concerns raised by Thomas Robert Malthus in his Essay on the Principle of Population. With regards to the energy factors, it indicates that the renewable energies help the European environment by reducing the level of carbon dioxide emissions whereas the higher energy intensity is an ecological threat.

Environmental and economic consequences of agricultural residue management chains are difficult to assess due to their complexity, seasonality and regionality. Designing multi-criteria decision support tools, applicable at an early-stage of research, is discussed. Improvement of Anaerobic Digestion (AD), one of the most mature conversion technologies, is discussed from a technological point of view and waste feedstock geographical and seasonal variations. Using agricultural residual resources for producing high-value chemicals is a considerable challenge analysed here, taking into account innovative eco-efficient and cost-effective cascading conversion processes (bio-refinery concept).

There is a rapidly evolving debate on definitions, limitations, the contribution to a wider sustainability agenda, and a need for indicators to assess the effectiveness of circular economy measures at larger scales. Herein, we present a framework for a comprehensive and economy-wide biophysical assessment of a CE, utilizing and systematically linking official statistics on resource extraction and use and waste flows in a mass-balanced approach. This framework builds on the widely applied framework of economy-wide material flow accounting and expands it by integrating waste flows, recycling, and downcycled materials. We propose a comprehensive set of indicators that measure the scale and circularity of total material and waste flows and their socioeconomic and ecological loop closing. We applied this framework in the context of monitoring efforts for a CE in the European Union (EU28) for the year 2014. We found that 7.4 gigatons (Gt) of materials were processed in the EU and only 0.71 Gt of them were secondary materials. The derived input socioeconomic cycling rate of materials was therefore 9.6%. Further, of the 4.8 Gt of interim output flows, 14.8% were recycled or downcycled. Based on these findings and our first efforts in assessing sensitivity of the framework, a number of improvements are deemed necessary: improved reporting of wastes, explicit modeling of societal in-use stocks, introduction of criteria for ecological cycling, and disaggregated mass-based indicators to evaluate environmental impacts of different materials and circularity initiatives.","[Mayer, Andreas; Haas, Willi; Wiedenhofer, Dominik; Krausmann, Fridolin] Univ Nat Resources & Life Sci BOKU, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Inst Social Ecol SEC, Vienna, Austria; [Nuss, Philip] German Environm Agcy UBA, Dessau Rosslau, Germany; [Blengini, Gian Andrea] European Commiss Directorate Gen Joint Res Ctr Su, Ispra, Italy",BOKU University,"Blengini, GA (corresponding author), European Commiss Directorate Gen Joint Res Ctr Su, Unit D3 Land Resources, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",gianandrea.blengini@ec.europa.eu,"Haas, Willi/M-4120-2018; Krausmann, Fridolin/N-1918-2015; blengini, gian andrea/C-1325-2013; Wiedenhofer, Dominik/AAA-5678-2020","Haas, Willi/0000-0001-5599-9227; Krausmann, Fridolin/0000-0002-9995-2372; Wiedenhofer, Dominik/0000-0001-7418-3477; Blengini, Gian Andrea/0000-0002-7977-1363; NUSS, Philip/0000-0001-9936-6886; Mayer, Andreas/0000-0002-6975-7082",Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [MISO P27590]; European Commission - Directorate-General Joint Research Centre (DG JRC) [CT-EX2016D288092-101-1]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P27590] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); European Commission - Directorate-General Joint Research Centre (DG JRC); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge funding by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF; project MISO P27590), and the European Commission - Directorate-General Joint Research Centre (DG JRC) under Expert Contract Number CT-EX2016D288092-101-1 for Willi Haas.",,84,160,167,7,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

This partial approach often delivers misleading messages for policy- and decision makers. It fails to accurately represent systems complexity, and obscures impacts, trade-offs and problem shifting that resource recovery processes or systems intended to promote circular economy may cause. Here, we challenge such partial approaches by critically reviewing the existing suite of environmental, economic, social and technical metrics that have been regularly observed and used in waste management and resource recovery systems' assessment studies, upstream and downstream of the point where waste is generated. We assess the potential of those metrics to evaluate 'complex value' of materials, components and products, i.e., the holistic sum of their environmental, economic, social and technical benefits and impacts across the system. Findings suggest that the way resource recovery systems are assessed and evaluated require simplicity, yet must retain a suitable minimum level of detail across all domains of value, which is pivotal for enabling sound decision-making processes. Criteria for defining a suitable set of metrics for assessing resource recovery from waste require them to be simple, transparent and easy to measure, and be both system- and stakeholder-specific. Future developments must focus on providing a framework for the selection of metrics that accurately describe (or at least reliably proxy for) benefits and impacts across all domains of value, enabling effective and transparent analysis of resource recovery form waste in circular economy systems.

Apart from the environmental and ecological advantages which can be brought about by the re-use and recycling of textiles, there are many benefits of a socio-economic nature. This paper analyses current trends on textile recycling, the barriers impeding greater recycling, and outlines the socio-economic advantages of moving towards a circular economy.

This article aims to capture the more recent progress made by the oil palm industry and to discuss the possible path research and development will take in the coming years. In 2017, palm oil and palm kernel oil production recorded close to one-third (75.17 million tonnes) of world total oils and fats production from a planted area of 19.04 million hectares, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia. Malaysian palm oil alone fetched RM 46.12 billion export revenue from its India and European Union markets. The continuous growth of the industry is made possible through implementation of key strategies covering the whole process chain, from upstream to downstream. Intensified mechanisation, integrated pest and Ganoderma management, advanced breeding and biotechnology as well as good agricultural practices help boost oil palm yields for both plantations and smallholdings. In the palm oil milling sector, focus such as by-products valorisation, biogas (productivity, trapping and utilisation as a form of energy) and wastewater management, i.e. palm oil mill effluent for final discharge compliance ensures that the industry meets its sustainable goals. Palm oil is generally used for edible purpose, however about 20% goes into higher value non-food applications such as palm biodiesel. The beneficial nutritional aspects of palm oil are evident based on its positional distribution and fatty acids composition, while its quality enhanced via technology integration/mitigation and analytical elucidations. Facing strong competition from petrochemicals, palm-based oleochemicals are strategically aimed at producing value-added products for niche and new markets. It is apparent that synergising conventional and disruptive technologies at every level of the palm oil supply chain is desirable and essential to thrust the industry forward. As a commodity, palm oil has not only emerged as an important food source, but has proven to be effectively utilised for feed, fuels and chemicals, to name a few, in developing a sustainable and balanced circular economy.","[Kushairi, A.; Loh, Soh Kheang; Azman, I; Hishamuddin, Elina; Ong-Abdullah, Meilina; Izuddin, Zanal Bidin Mohd Noor; Razmah, G.; Sundram, Shamala; Parveez, Ghulam Kadir Ahmad] Malaysian Palm Oil Board, 6 Persiaran Inst, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia",Malaysian Palm Oil Board,"Kushairi, A (corresponding author), Malaysian Palm Oil Board, 6 Persiaran Inst, Kajang 43000, Selangor, Malaysia.",kushairi@mpob.gov.my,"Parveez, Ghulam Kadir Ahmad/E-8272-2015; Hishamuddin, Elina/C-7553-2014; Loh, Soh Kheang/J-4636-2016; Hishamuddin, Hawa/D-2089-2017","Parveez, Ghulam Kadir Ahmad/0000-0002-1092-3437; Loh, Soh Kheang/0000-0003-0765-0164; Hishamuddin, Hawa/0000-0002-7512-5022; Sundram, Shamala/0000-0002-7912-828X; Ong-Abdullah, Meilina/0000-0003-4825-5021",,,,,232,159,161,5,80,MALAYSIAN PALM OIL BOARD,KUALA LUMPUR,"PO BOX 10620, KUALA LUMPUR, 50720, MALAYSIA",,1511-2780,,J OIL PALM RES,J.

In this regard, anaerobic digestion (AD) of sludge should be paid renewed attention to resolve a low conversion efficiency of biosolids. As a potential way to energy positive operation, exogenous iron has been proposed to enhance methane production in recent years. In this review, the authors provided a deep insight into the feasibility of iron-enhanced AD system. Hydrogen evolution from iron corrosion and its effects on CH4 production is firstly reviewed; then the roles of iron in reducing ORP was illustrated with regard to its impact on fermentation type; serving as an essential element and potential electron donor, the stimulating effects of iron on microorganisms and enzyme activities were also elaborated, and thus the technical feasibility of iron-based AD could be evaluated. In regards of the environmental and economic impacts of iron-based AD, life cycle assessment (LCA) was employed to calculate its economic feasibility, and the results revealed that iron-based AD system could reduce both operational costs and carbon emissions. Conclusion was drawn that iron-based anaerobic digestion is promising on technical level as well as economic perspective, and is expected to contribute to carbon-neutral operation of WWTPs. Iron-based anaerobic digestion is such a promising and sustainable strategy towards circular economy that it could be applied to many cross-disciplinary fields.","[Wei, Jing; Hao, Xiaodi; van Loosdrecht, Mark C.

On average, out of 1.3 billion tons of municipal solid wastes generated per year, around 130 and 2.1 million tons are incinerated in the world and in Belgium, respectively. Around 400 kT of bottom ash residues are generated in Flanders, out of which only 102 kT are utilized here, and the rest is exported or landfilled due to non-conformity to environmental regulations. Landfilling makes the valuable resources in the residues unavailable and results in more primary raw materials being used, increasing mining and related hazards. Identifying and employing the right pre-treatment technique for the highest value application is the key to attaining a circular economy. We reviewed the present pre-treatment and utilization scenarios in Belgium, and the advancements in research around the world for realization of maximum utilization are reported in this paper. Uses of the material in the cement industry as a binder and cement raw meal replacement are identified as possible effective utilization options for large quantities of bottom ash. Pre-treatment techniques that could facilitate this use are also discussed.

Expectations for the circular economy are articulated as: (1) a perfect circle of slow material flows; (2) a shift from consumer to user; (3) growth through circularity and decoupling; and (4) a solution to European renewal. Extending boundaries of what is 'in' benefits actors driving the circular economy as, in the short-term, they can actively support a deliberately vague, but uncontroversial, circular economy. On the one hand, the expectations present a strong sense of a collective 'we', on the other hand we are yet to see the contentions and contestations being full playing out.","[Lazarevic, David; Valve, Helena] Finnish Environm Inst, Environm Policy Ctr, Helsinki, Finland; [Lazarevic, David] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Stockholm, Sweden",Finnish Environment Institute; Royal Institute of Technology,"Lazarevic, D (corresponding author), Finnish Environm Inst, Environm Policy Ctr, Helsinki, Finland.",david.lazarevic@ymparisto.fi,,"Lazarevic, David/0000-0002-9869-9707; Valve, Helena/0000-0002-1484-4568",Prime Minister's Office Finland; Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation; Swedish Innovation Agency,Prime Minister's Office Finland; Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation; Swedish Innovation Agency(Vinnova),"This paper originates from two projects: Circular economy in Finland - operational environment, policy instruments and modelled impacts by 2030 (KIVIKI), funded by the Prime Minister's Office Finland, and Renewal of manufacturing towards a sustainable circular bioeconomy and implications for innovation policy (RECIBI), funded by the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation and the Swedish Innovation Agency.

Its role in the transition to a circular economy (CE) is critical. However, research from a holistic perspective, including how new business models can enable materials to increase their residual values, need to be deepened. This study provides a comprehensive and holistic overview of how the built environment approaches the study and the actions of the circular economy. Through a systematic literature review, 318 papers were selected and evaluated by two optics: i) a descriptive analysis and ii) a thematic analysis. The descriptive analysis highlights the relevance and incipient nature of circular thinking, the qualitative nature of the research, and the predominance of European countries and China at the forefront of circular research. In the thematic analysis, five axes were established as guiding lines of research, which evidenced the focus of research on minimizing and reusing construction and demolition waste. This study aims to provide the state of the art on CE research through a literature review. The results show research gaps and a theoretical framework was proposed to guide future research. The need for more explanations about CE and circular business models is highlighted, as well as greater integration between stakeholders in the construction value chain. Government support, such as subsidies, laws and tax incentives, is crucial to the strategic performance of decision-makers to introduce circular principles and make buildings and the built environment more sustainable.

By addressing issues related to resource depletion, waste management and pollution, IS plays an important role in the transition towards sustainable development. In the literature, two conceptual perspectives on IS can be identified: the Industrial Ecology (IE) and the Circular Economy (CE) perspective. Despite the recognition of these two perspectives, their relationship remains unclear and explicit attempts to develop an integrated perspective have not been made yet. Consequently, the goal of this research is to highlight and start addressing this critical gap of knowledge in order to support future research and practice geared towards the design of new IS clusters. We pose the following research question: How can the IE and CE perspectives on IS be combined in order to support the design of IS clusters? To this end, we first investigate the two perspectives more in depth and compare them in terms of nature, features and relevance for the study of IS. This is done by applying them as conceptual lenses for the analysis of the same case study, an existing IS cluster. The comparative analysis provides insights into how the two perspectives differ, ultimately demonstrating that they are complimentary and both necessary to fully describe an IS cluster. While the CE perspective is more suitable to explain how a cluster functions from a business standpoint in the operating phase, the IE perspective is more suitable to explain its development over time and its impacts on the environment, the economy and society. Building upon the outcomes of the comparative analysis, we leverage on the discipline of Strategic Design and integrate the two perspectives into a process for designing new IS clusters. We suggest two directions for future research. First, improving our comparative analysis of the two perspectives by looking at a wider sample of IS clusters of different sizes and in different contexts. Second, focusing with more specificity on the issue of how IS clusters can be designed, potentially by trying to apply the process we propose on a real case aimed at designing a new IS cluster.

Most of this body of knowledge has a broad focus, but sectors and products differ, and if circularity is to materialise, a more tailored understanding and approach is necessary. This paper focuses on the built environment, where its constituting elements (buildings and infrastructure) are characterised by long lifespans, numerous stakeholders, and hundreds of components and ancillary materials that interact dynamically in space and time. To facilitate the pathway towards circularity, we have attempted to identify the barriers to and enablers for the circular economy within the built environment. This will form the basis of future work to build consensus on the future development of the circular economy.

In this study are examined three possibilities for the valorisation of exhausted biosorbents loaded with metal ions, namely: (i) regeneration and reuse of biosorbents in multiple biosorption cycles, (ii) the use of exhausted biosorbents as fertilizers for soils poor in essential microelements, and (iii) the pyrolysis of exhausted biosorbents, under well defined conditions. The main advantages and disadvantages of each valorisation possibility are reviewed in order to find the best way to use these cheap materials in accordance with the principles of the circular economy and thereby contributing to the development of sustainable biosorption technology.","[Badescu, Iulia Simona; Bulgariu, Laura] Tech Univ Gheorghe Asachi Iasi, Fac Chem Engn & Environm Protect Cristofor Simion, Dept Environm Engn & Management, Iasi 700050, Romania; [Bulgariu, Dumitru] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Geog & Geol, Dept Geol & Geochem, Iasi 700506, Romania; [Bulgariu, Dumitru] Romanian Acad, Filial Iasi, Collect Geog, Iasi 700506, Romania; [Ahmad, Iftikhar] COMSATS Univ Islamabad, Dept Environm Sci, Vehari Campus, Vehari 61100, Pakistan",GH Asachi Technical University; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Romanian Academy of Sciences; COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI),"Bulgariu, L (corresponding author), Tech Univ Gheorghe Asachi Iasi, Fac Chem Engn & Environm Protect, Dept Environm Engn & Management, D Mangeron,71A, Iasi 700050, Romania.",lbulg@tuiasi.ro,"Ahmad, Iftikhar/AGL-6872-2022; Bulgariu, Laura/B-9176-2011; Ahmad, Mirza Iftikhar/KHD-2053-2024","Ahmad, Iftikhar/0000-0001-8811-1247; Bulgariu, Laura/0000-0002-2213-9228;","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-III-P4-ID-PCE-2016-0500]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","Financial support for this study was provided by the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-III-P4-ID-PCE-2016-0500.",,96,158,159,5,80,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Using n-hexane and n-hexane/isopropanol mixture highest oil yield was achived during soxhlet extraction of oil from spent coffee grounds. Alternatively, supercritical carbon dioxide can be employed as a green solvent for the extraction of oil. Using advanced chemical and biotechnological methods, spent coffee grounds are converted to various biofuels such as, biodiesel, renewable diesel, bioethanol, bioethers, bio-oil, biochar, and biogas. The in-situ transesterification of spent coffee grounds was carried out in a large scale (4 kg), which led to 80-83% biodiesel yield. In addition, a large number of value added and diversified products viz. polyhydroxyalkanoates, biosorbent, activated carbon, polyol, polyurethane foam, carotenoid, phenolic antioxidants, and green composite are obtained from spent coffee grounds.

Therefore, a multidisciplinary perspective is required to sketch why a transition from diets based primarily on animal proteins towards diets based primarily on plant proteins products is extremely urgent for both food security and sustainability. Scope and approach: This review starts out by identifying ecological, economic and social aspects of sustainable food consumption. Subsequently, it is argued how protein supply is underlying and linking the top-3 of anthropogenic impacts based on the planetary boundaries concept, i.e. 1) biodiversity loss, 2) nitrogen cycle acceleration, and 3) carbon cycle acceleration (resulting in climate change). These environmental impacts associated with current Western food consumption need to be reduced urgently. In order to address the inefficiencies inherent to current dietary patterns, therefore, a ranked list of more sustainable options is proposed, based on their order of magnitude. Addressing consumers, industry, and governmental stakeholders plus cultural aspects, challenges and options are sketched. Key findings and conclusions: Clearly, a dietary transition from primarily animal towards plant protein products is required. Fortunately, new dietary guidelines are increasingly taking sustainability into account and the contours of a diet transition are slowly emerging.","[Aiking, Harry; de Boer, Joop] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Aiking, H (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",harry.aiking@vu.nl; joop.de.boer@vu.nl,"de Boer, Joop/N-3889-2019; Aiking, Harry/AAH-4435-2019","de Boer, Joop/0000-0001-7458-7148; Aiking, Harry/0000-0002-9174-2899",Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"This work reported here is based in part on results from the Protein Foods, Environment, Technology and Society (PROFETAS) research program funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).

Studies addressed to clean from misuse of plant fungicides, soil fumigants, and fertilizers have encouraged the search of eco-friendly alternatives. This paper aims to give deeper understand of new insights for on-farm composting and compost-based tea application for soil and plant through the virtuous reuse of agricultural waste. On-farm composting is viable option thanks to benefits on soil quality and plant health which valorize underused biomass. This paper critically discusses and compares the most promising technologies in order to recycle in situ residual biomass into high-value added products for soil amendment (compost) and plant treatment (compost-based tea). Compost contains minerals, heavy metals, humic substances, and endogenous microorganisms to improve soil quality. Compost application had many benefits against plant pathogens and diseases due to innovative tailored formulates. Compost can be employed either alone or in combination with exogenous microbial consortia (protists, fungi, oomycetes, yeast, actinomycetes, and bacteria) acting as biological control agents by fitting the agrochemical market requirements for improving soil quality and plant health. Liquid formulations made of crude compost-based teas and/or tailored mixtures of humic acids, fulvic acids, humin, macro-micronutrients, and endogenous microbiota have many benefits for plant growth and crop health. Nonetheless, the complex European regulations and national laws, manure surplus, variability in availability and transporting of compost, variability in compost quality and feedstock composition, greenhouse gas emissions, and energy requirement were very hard barriers for on-farm composting and compost derivatives application. Recommendations, novelties, innovations, sustainability, and directions of future researches that may help to solve a number of these issues under the new perspective of a circular economy system were presented and discussed.

In this review, recent advances in electrode materials, microbe-catalyzed CO2 reduction and MES energy consumption are discussed in detail. Anode materials are briefly reviewed first, with several strategies proposed to reduce the energy input for electron generation and enhance MES bioeconomy. This was followed by discussions on MES cathode materials and configurations for enhanced chemolithoautotroph growth and CO2 reduction. Various chemolithoautotrophs, effective for CO2 reduction and diverse bioproduct formation, on MES cathode were also discussed. Finally, research efforts on developing cost-effective process for bioproduct extraction from MES are presented. Future perspectives to improve product formation and reduce energy cost are discussed to realize the application of the MES as a chemical production platform in the context of building a circular economy.","[Bian, Bin; Bajracharya, Suman; Xu, Jiajie; Saikaly, Pascal E.] King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Water Desalinat & Reuse Ctr, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia; [Pant, Deepak] Flemish Inst Technol Res VITO, Separat & Convers Technol, Boeretang 200, B-2400 Mol, Belgium; [Pant, Deepak] Ctr Adv Proc Technol Urban Resource Recovery CAPT, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",King Abdullah University of Science & Technology; VITO,"Saikaly, PE (corresponding author), King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol, Water Desalinat & Reuse Ctr, Biol & Environm Sci & Engn Div, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.",pascal.saikaly@kaust.edu.sa,"Saikaly, Pascal/G-7958-2014; Pant, Deepak/B-3290-2010; xu, jiajie/AFO-0140-2022; Bajracharya, Suman/G-8237-2015","Saikaly, Pascal/0000-0001-7678-3986; Pant, Deepak/0000-0002-1425-9588; Bajracharya, Suman/0000-0003-1168-1430; Bian, Bin/0000-0001-5270-4964; Xu, Jiajie/0000-0002-3931-4766",KAUST [URF/1/2985-01-01],KAUST(King Abdullah University of Science & Technology),This work was supported by Competitive Research Grant (URF/1/2985-01-01) from KAUST to PS.,,120,157,160,51,357,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-8524,1873-2976,,BIORESOURCE TECHNOL,Bioresour.

In the current scenario, e-waste management has become the top priority of all the developed and developing nations especially those in the transition phase. The generation of e-waste has increased proportionally across the world and created an intense pressure on the firms to implement sustainable practices to redesign and recycle the products. The current status of the developing countries like India confronts number of challenges to manage e-waste produced, and the only possible solution is to minimize the waste generation and practicing recycling processes. For transforming into CEs, there is a need to identify the most influencing key enablers through which an effective and robust e-waste management (e-WM) system can be developed. An extensive literature review and expert judgments are expended to identify the most influencing key enablers of e-WM in circular economies, and, being the highest producer of e-waste, Mumbai (Maharashtra) has been chosen as the case location. To explore the strength of causal and effect enablers, the DEMATEL method is applied. This study has shown that 'Environmental management system' (EMS) is the most significant and important driving enabler to influence all the other existing enablers. This study has also highlighted that e-WM can be efficient if it focuses on producing eco-friendly products, developing strict legislations, building green image and supporting the producers to implement CE practices. This study helps stakeholders and policy makers to reduce the burden from the environment and focus on developing an efficient e-WM system on the basis of identified key enablers like EMS and collaboration with environmental partners to contribute towards CE transition.","[Sharma, Manu] Doon Univ, Sch Management, Mkt & Advertising Area, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Joshi, Sudhanshu] Doon Univ, Sch Management, Operat & Supply Chain Area, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India; [Kumar, Ashwani] Jaipuria Inst Management, Noida, India",Doon University; Doon University,"Sharma, M (corresponding author), Doon Univ, Sch Management, Mkt & Advertising Area, Dehra Dun, Uttarakhand, India.",manusharma@doonuniversity.ac.in; sudhanshujoshi@doonuniversity.ac.in; ashwani.983@gmail.com,"Joshi, Sudhanshu/L-2284-2019; Joshi, Sudhanshu/Z-1441-2018","Joshi, Sudhanshu/0000-0003-4748-5001; Kumar, Ashwani/0000-0003-4357-5210; Sharma, Manu/0000-0001-7339-7780",,,,,147,157,157,11,88,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

A systematic literature review was conducted in order to identify and examine the following key areas: (1) the new demands faced by OM decision-making regarding changes in capability, work procedures, intra- and inter-organizational relationships and technologies; (2) the specific changes OM decision-making must make in order to support CE business models (based on the ReSOLVE framework); and (3) guidelines which will help designers and operations and logistics/supply chain managers develop the necessary skills to meet society and the global market's emerging demands. The findings of this research will allow operations managers to foresee the unfolding needs for capacity building in CE, and scholars can build on the results of this article to develop new research themes. Furthermore, this is the first article to describe the ways in which OM knowledge can support the transition towards the circular economy based on the perspective of dynamic capabilities.

Additionally, consumers' demand for healthier foodstuffs has increased over the last years, and thus the food industry has strived to answer this challenge. Byproducts are generally secondary products derived from primary agro-food production processes and represent an interesting and cheaper source of potentially functional ingredients, such as peptides, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds, thus promoting a circular economy concept. The existing body of work has shown that byproducts and their extracts may be successfully incorporated into foodstuffs, for instance, phenolic compounds from eggplant can be potentially used as a mulfitunctional food additive with antimicrobial, antioxidant, and food colorant properties. As such, the aim of this review is to provide insights into byproducts and their potential as new sources of foodstuffs additives.","[Faustino, Margarida; Veiga, Mariana; Sousa, Pedro; Costa, Eduardo M.; Silva, Sara; Pintado, Manuela] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Escola Super Biotecnol, CBQF, Lab Associado, Rua Arquiteto Lobao Vital 172, P-4200374 Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Pintado, M (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Escola Super Biotecnol, CBQF, Lab Associado, Rua Arquiteto Lobao Vital 172, P-4200374 Porto, Portugal.",afaustino@porto.ucp.pt; mveiga@porto.ucp.pt; pedro.miguel.c.s@hotmail.com; emcosta@porto.ucp.pt; snsilva@porto.cup.pt; mpintado@porto.ucp.pt,"Pintado, Maria Manuela/AAW-6709-2021; Silva, Sara/GXM-8709-2022; Pintado, Maria Manuela/ABE-2085-2021; Costa, Eduardo/AFP-6514-2022","Pintado, Maria Manuela/0000-0002-0760-3184; Faustino, Ana Margarida/0000-0001-9859-7092; Silva, Sara/0000-0001-8268-2137; Sousa, Pedro/0000-0003-2587-7784; Costa, Eduardo/0000-0003-3121-4514; Luz-Veiga, Mariana/0000-0002-1815-3270","National Funds from FCT [UID/Multi/50016/2013, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016403]; FEDER [PDR2020-101-030775]; QREN-ANI [17819]",National Funds from FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); QREN-ANI,"This work was supported by National Funds from FCT (grant number UID/Multi/50016/2013, POCI-01-0145-FEDER-016403) from FEDER (grant number PDR2020-101-030775) and from QREN-ANI (grant number 17819).",,228,157,167,9,73,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1420-3049,,MOLECULES,Molecules,MAR 2,2019,24,6,,,,,,,1056,10.3390/molecules24061056,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules24061056,,,23,"Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Chemistry,HU8AD,30889812,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000465503800032,View Full Record in Web of Science

CE approach is an industrial system that is restorative by design, and it emphasises that it is important that, rather than extracting natural resources, the materials that have already been taken can and should be recovered and reused in different ways, thereby securing natural resources from over-exploitation. In order to meet CE assumptions, modern and innovative technologies that allow for the recovery of valuable materials should be developed. This also applies to eco-innovation that connects technology development with environmental aspects. It is therefore obvious that issues of CE and eco-innovation are linked, and a uniform methodology aimed at compare the levels of moving to CE including eco-innovation solutions should be established. Because the focus in European Union (EU) has been paid on regions, measuring of CE-eco-innovations levels is especially important at the regional level. In this paper, the proposals of CE indicators, based on eco-innovation factors, which can be possible to create based on existing data set (Eurostat, Cohesion policy) are presented. It is recommend to use of five group indicators for measuring regional CE-eco-innovation. Based on Eco-Innovation Scoreboard which describes innovation measurement, three of proposed indicator groups are associated directly with innovations, taking into account the principles of CE: CE-eco-innovation inputs, CE-eco-innovation activities and CE-eco-innovation outputs, and other two groups of indicators are effects of the CE-eco-innovation introduction: resource efficiency outcomes and socio-economic outcomes. This way of measuring CE-eco-innovation allows for create holistic, systematic and integrated approach for the CE concept at the regional level. Proposed indicators can be used in current transition stage for assessment of implementation regional policy and as a base for creation final CE indicators.","[Smol, Marzena] Polish Acad Sci, Mineral & Energy Econ Res Inst, Wybickiego 7, PL-31261 Krakow, Poland; [Kulczycka, Joanna] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Krakow, Poland; [Avdiushchenko, Anna] Jagiellonian Univ, Krakow, Poland; [Avdiushchenko, Anna] Natl Min Univ, Fac Management, Dnipropetrovks, Ukraine",Polish Academy of Sciences; Mineral & Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences; AGH University of Krakow; Jagiellonian University; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Dnipro University of Technology,"Smol, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mineral & Energy Econ Res Inst, Wybickiego 7, PL-31261 Krakow, Poland.",smol@meeri.pl,"Smol, Marzena/AAS-7916-2020; Kulczycka, Joanna/AAC-9610-2021; Avdiushchenko, Anna/F-7239-2015","Smol, Marzena/0000-0001-5833-2954; Kulczycka, Joanna/0000-0002-4377-5506; Avdiushchenko, Anna/0000-0001-6744-1968",Electra project - Erasmus Mundus programme of the European Union [2012-2738]; Ministry of Science and Higher education of Poland (statutory research of Mineral and Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences MEERI PAS and AGH University of Science and Technology),Electra project - Erasmus Mundus programme of the European Union; Ministry of Science and Higher education of Poland (statutory research of Mineral and Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences MEERI PAS and AGH University of Science and Technology),This study is supported by the Electra project (agreement number 2012-2738) that is financed by the Erasmus Mundus programme of the European Union and by Ministry of Science and Higher education of Poland (statutory research of Mineral and Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences MEERI PAS and AGH University of Science and Technology).,,51,157,162,5,112,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-954X,1618-9558,,CLEAN TECHNOL ENVIR,Clean Technol.

Examples of industrial symbiosis have grown over the years with increasing geographic dispersion. Thus, through a comprehensive review of previous studies, this work aims to trace the trend of industrial symbiosis research and to map the existing case studies around the world, with a critical analysis of its impact. The analysis of the 584 selected publications allowed tracing the evolution of these according to their content and the type of article, as well as its distribution by journals. Based on the literature review, the main lines for research in industrial symbiosis are assessed, as well as an updated study of the published case studies is provided with emphasis on the location, type of industry and employed methodologies. Several challenges are then identified for future research. The results reveal the number of articles on industrial symbiosis has greatly increased since 2007 and China is the country with the largest number of publications and cases of industrial symbiosis, followed by the United States. The methods for quantifying impacts and analysing industrial symbiosis networks were the most widely used. The analysis of the published case studies allowed an overview of the industrial symbiosis in the world and showed that the potential for application is enormous, both in developed countries and in countries with developing economies, and although the most present economic activities in the synergies are associated with the manufacturing sector, the possibilities of industrial symbiosis are not restricted to these activities nor to the number of entities involved. The symbioses between industry and the surrounding community also have great potential for development with numerous advantages for both parties. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The field of metallic materials degradation, generally faced by using toxic compounds, found a fertile research field in green chemistry. In fact, the use of inhibitors is a well-known strategy when metal corrosion needs to be prevented, controlled, or retarded. Green inhibitors are biodegradable, ecologically acceptable and renewable. Their valorization expands possible applications in industrial fields other than waste to energy' in the perspective of circular economy. Although lot of experimental work has been done and many research papers have been published, the topic of green inhibitors is still an open issue. The great interest in the field expanded the research, resulting in high numbers of tested molecules. However, the most frequently adopted approaches are conventional and, hence, not suitable to fully characterize the potential efficacy of inhibitors.

Non-biodegradable plastics settlements in landfills are uncertain, which hinders the production of land resources. Non-biodegradable plastic solid wastes, carbon dioxide, greenhouse gases, various air pollutants, cancerous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dioxins, released to the environment cause severe damage and harmfulness to the inhabitants. Due to the bio-degradability and renewability of biopolymers, petroleum-based plastics can be replaced with bio-based polymers in order to minimize the environmental risks. In this review article, bio-degradability of polymers has been discussed. The mechanisms of bio-recycling have been particularly emphasized in the present article.","[Thakur, Sourbh; Tamulevicius, Sigitas] Kaunas Univ Technol, Inst Mat Sci, Barsausko 59, LT-51423 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Thakur, Sourbh; Chaudhary, Jyoti; Sharma, Bhawna; Verma, Ankit] Shoolini Univ, Sch Chem, Solan 173212, Himachal Prades, India; [Thakur, Vijay Kumar] Cranfield Univ, Sch Aerosp Transport & Mfg, Enhanced Composites & Struct Ctr, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Kaunas University of Technology; Shoolini University; Cranfield University,"Thakur, S (corresponding author), Kaunas Univ Technol, Inst Mat Sci, Barsausko 59, LT-51423 Kaunas, Lithuania.;Thakur, S (corresponding author), Shoolini Univ, Sch Chem, Solan 173212, Himachal Prades, India.;Thakur, VK (corresponding author), Cranfield Univ, Sch Aerosp Transport & Mfg, Enhanced Composites & Struct Ctr, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",thakursourbh@gmail.com; vijay.kumar@cranfield.ac.uk,"Chaudhary, Jyoti/JXM-7623-2024; Thakur, Sourbh/HTP-5624-2023; Thakur, Vijay Kumar/J-1691-2015; Tamulevicius, Sigitas/G-5801-2010","Chaudhary, Jyoti/0000-0002-0194-4914; Thakur, Sourbh/0000-0001-9799-6921; Thakur, Vijay Kumar/0000-0002-0790-2264; Tamulevicius, Sigitas/0000-0002-9965-2724",ESF [09.3.3-LMT-K-712-02-0180],ESF,Sourbh Thakur acknowledges financial support by ESF program Post-doctoral Fellowship project No 09.3.3-LMT-K-712-02-0180.,,73,156,164,10,253,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2452-2236,,,CURR OPIN GREEN SUST,Curr.

The co-existence of diametrically opposite interpretations of the concept indicates lack of a serious discussion of its theoretical foundations. Two narratives on circular bioeconomy are explored in depth: (i) the new economic paradigm based on technological progress (the economics of technological promises) that seeks perpetual economic growth; (ii) an entropic (thermodynamic) narrative that reflects on the limits on economic growth imposed by nature. The latter narrative makes a distinction between primary, secondary and tertiary resource flows and helps to identify what can and cannot be re-circulated within the metabolic pattern of social-ecological systems. Adopting the biophysical view, it becomes clear that the industrial revolution represented a linearization of material and energy flows with the goal to overcome the low pace and density of biological transformations. The required level of productivity of production factors in contemporary developed economies (flows per hour of labor and per hectare of land use) is orders of magnitude larger than the pace and density of supply and sink capacity of natural processes. Relying on nature to 'close the loop' will simply slow down the economic process.","[Giampietro, Mario] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Bellaterra 08193, Spain; [Giampietro, Mario] ICREA, Pg Lluis Co 23, Barcelona 08010, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; ICREA,"Giampietro, M (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Inst Ciencia & Tecnol Ambientals, Bellaterra 08193, Spain.",mario.giampietro@uab.cat,"Giampietro, Mario/F-6874-2016","Giampietro, Mario/0000-0002-5569-7023","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [689669]; Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (MICINN) through the Maria de Maeztu program [MDM-2015-0552]","European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(Horizon 2020); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities (MICINN) through the Maria de Maeztu program","I am deeply indebted to Sandra G.F.

The research method applied is an in-depth nested single case study of a circular project. Our results highlight an exemplar case of an ecosystemic business model in agriculture, involving different types of innovation and strong collaboration among network members, orchestrated by a focal firm.

Most of the methodologies developed so far measure resource efficiency on the basis of the environmental burden of the resource relative to the value of output. However, the key point of circular economy is keeping resources within the economy when products no longer serve their functions so that materials can be used again and therefore generate more value. The unit in which resource efficiency and circular economy are measured greatly affects both the ease of acceptance by policymakers and the direction in which green policy will change our society. Whereas the most common approaches to assessing resource efficiency and circular economy use mass, in this paper we advocate measuring both resource efficiency and circular economy in terms of the market value of 'stressed' resources, since this value incorporates the elements of scarcity versus competition as well as taxes representing urgent social and environmental externalities. The market value of resources is well-documented and responds automatically to the locality and time at which resources are used. Applying this unit, circularity is defined as the percentage of the value of stressed resources incorporated in a service or product that is returned after its end-of-life. Resource efficiency is the ratio of added product value divided by the value of stressed resources used in production or a process thereof. It is argued that precisely the concept of a free market, in which materials, parts and components are exchanged purely on the basis of their functionality and cost, allows the resource efficiency of a process (KPI for industry and governance) to be distinguished from the resource efficiency of a product (KPI for consumers and governance). Using standard industry data from Statistics Netherlands, the resource efficiency of several Dutch industries were evaluated using the new methodology and compared with a traditional mass-based approach.

Although some aspects of CE adoption within industrial supply chains have been researched extensively (particularly addressing challenges of design, implementation, and operations), the research that relates CE practices with sustainability performance to reveal the current state of CE practices within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is scant. The aim of this research was to facilitate SMEs to achieve greater sustainability through CE implementation. This research addresses three research questions-How are CE fields of action related to sustainability performance? What are the issues, challenges, and opportunities of adopting CE in SMEs? And what key strategies, resources, and competences facilitate effective implementation of CE in SMEs? This study adopts a mixed method approach (qualitative and quantitative) using survey research, focus group, and case studies; 130 randomly selected SMEs within the Midlands of the United Kingdom have been surveyed, and the responses are analysed using statistical tools along with findings from focus groups and case studies. The study reveals that all CE fields of action (take, make, distribute, use, and recover) of SMEs are correlated to economic performance, but only make and use are related to environmental and social performance. The study further derives strategies, resources, and competences for achieving sustainability across all the CE field of actions.

The following five research propositions are derived from the findings of the explorative case analysis: 1) the cost-efficiency of circular operations is the key proponent to successful CE business, 2) take-back services enable the acquisition of particular wastes as resources, but they need to be incentivized through reductions in customers' total waste management costs, 3) circular business models require the focal firm to separately manage multiple positions in the value chain, 4) the take-back system for gaining value through CE can be implemented successfully in multiple ways, and 5) recycling is easier to implement than reducing or reusing due to a smaller impact on the business. These propositions contribute to the circular business model literature by showing how economic value is generated by CE initiatives and providing foundations for theory-testing future research. The propositions also provide guidance for policymakers and managers on supporting and implementing circular business. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this paper is to clarify linkages between these two concepts. It identifies mutual theory applications used to study GSCM and CE. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review is conducted to identify theories from GSCM and CE studies. A critical analysis explores the theories that can provide mutual applications between GSCM and CE fields. Propositions are developed. Findings In all, 12 theories are applied in both GSCM and CE studies. Several theories are only applied in GSCM studies, but can help to advance CE study. These theories include complexity, transaction cost economics, agency, and information theories. Each of the eight theories only applied to CE can potentially advance GSCM study. Research limitations/implications The findings contribute to further theory development for both GSCM and CE study. A methodological review can advance theoretical development and cross-pollination in both fields.

A circular bioeconomy implies a more efficient resource management of bio-based renewable resources by integrating circular economy principles into the bioeconomy. These ideas have been well received at industry level since they are deemed to foster cost reductions, innovation and competitiveness. While recent scientific literature has dwelt on sustainability-related circular business models, empirical research on company-level implementation is only just emerging. Our study contributes to addressing this research lacuna by seeking answers to two questions: 1. How do small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) propose, create and deliver, and capture value through circular bioeconomy business models?; and 2. What are the business challenges and opportunities related to the operationalization of such business models? To this end, we employed content analysis on interview data gathered from managers in Finnish SME companies from the field of packaging, textiles, composite materials, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products. We outlined the main business model archetypes, and identified the key characteristics that enable value capture and delivery for various stakeholders. The contribution of this study is duly two-fold. From the perspective of a theoretical contribution, we expand and refine the conceptualization of sustainable circular bioeconomy and related business models. In addition, based on our findings, we provide insights and recommendations for researchers and policy-makers to advance the sustainability transition to a circular bioeconomy in the context of the forest-based industry, and for the management of SMEs to reflect on company viability and growth.","[D'Amato, Dalia; Veijonaho, Simo; Toppinen, Anne] Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [D'Amato, Dalia; Toppinen, Anne] Helsinki Inst Sustainabil Sci, Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"D'Amato, D (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Agr & Forestry, Dept Forest Sci, Helsinki, Finland.",dalia.damato@helsinki.fi,"D'Amato, Dalia/AAJ-6538-2020","D'Amato, Dalia/0000-0002-3992-7263","Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Academy of Finland (project OPES) [315912, 307480]; Academy of Finland (project ORBIT) [315912, 307480]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [315912] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA)",Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation; Academy of Finland (project OPES); Academy of Finland (project ORBIT); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),"This study was realized with funding from the Jenny and Antti Wihuri Foundation, and from the Academy of Finland (projects OPES and ORBIT, funding decisions 315912 and 307480).

In this context, the EU has proposed increasing targets to encourage the recycling of (plastic) packaging. To accurately calculate the recycling rates, detailed information on the flows of plastic packaging is needed. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to quantitatively and qualitatively investigate the waste management system for plastic packaging in Austria in 2013 using material flow analysis, taking into account the used product types and the polymer composition. The results show that 300,000 +/- 3% t/a (35 kg/cap.a) of waste plastic packaging were produced, mainly composed of large and small films and small hollow bodies, including PET bottles. Correspondingly, the polymer composition of the waste stream was dominated by LDPE (46% +/- 6%), PET (19% +/- 4%) and PP (14%+/- 6%). 58% +/- 3% was collected separately, and regarding the final treatment, 26% +/- 7% of the total waste stream was recovered as re granulates, whereas the rest was thermally recovered in waste-to-energy plants (40% +/- 3%) and the cement industry (33% +/- 6%). The targets set by the EU and Austria were reached comfortably, although to reach the proposed future target major technological steps regarding collection and sorting will be needed. However, the current calculation point of the targets, i.e. on the input side of the recycling plant, is not deemed to be fully in line with the overall objective of the circular economy, namely to keep materials in the economy and prevent losses. It is therefore recommended that the targets be calculated with respect to the actual output of the recycling process, provided that the quality of the output products is maintained, to accurately assess the performance of the waste management system.

It features the creation of a quantitative tool, the reuse potential indicator to specify how resource-like versus how waste-like specific materials are on a continuum. Even with increasing attention to waste reuse and resource conservation, constant changes in product composition and complexity have left material managers without adequate guidance to make decisions about what is technically feasible to recover from the discard stream even before markets can be considered. The reuse potential indicator is developed to aid management decision-making about waste based not on perception but more objectively on the technical ability of the materials to be reused in commerce. This new indicator is based on the extent of technological innovation and commercial application of actual reuse approaches identified and cataloged. Coal combustion by-products (CCBs) provide the test case for calculating the reuse potential indicator. While CCBs are often perceived as wastes and then isolated in landfills or surface impoundments, there is also a century-long history in the industry of developing technologies to reuse CCBs. The recent statistics show that most CCBs generated in Europe and Japan are reused (90-95%), but only 40-45% of CCBs are used in the United States. According to the reuse potential calculation, however, CCBs in the United States have high technical reusability. Of the four CCBs examined under three different regulatory schemes, reuse potential for boiler slag and flue-gas desulfurization gypsum maintains a value greater than 0.8 on a 0-1 scale, indicating they are at least 80% resource-like. Under current regulation in the United States, both fly ash and bottom ash are 80-90% resource-like. Very strict regulation would remove many reuse options decreasing potential for these two CCBs to 30% resource-like. A more holistic view of waste and broad application of the new indicator would make clear what technologies are available and assist public and private decision makers in setting quantitative material reuse targets from a new knowledge base that reinforces a resource-based paradigm.

Existing methods used to provide this evidence (e.g. LCA, LCSA, CBA) are not robust enough to adequately address the creation and dissipation of systemic and multidimensional value that spans the social, environmental, economic and technical domains. This study proposes a novel, conceptual approach that seeks to assess how complex value is created, destroyed and distributed in resource recovery from waste systems. This approach expands beyond conventional methods of estimating value. It combines scientific and engineering methods with a socio-political narrative grounded in the systems of provision (sop) approach, and provides a comprehensive, analytical framework for making the transition to a resource-efficient future. This framework has the potential to connect bottom-up and top-down approaches in assessing resource recovery from waste systems, and address systemic challenges through transparency and flexibility, while accounting for the dynamic and non-linear nature of commodities flow and infrastructure provision in the overall system. This creates the pathway towards circular economy, and lays the foundations for future advances in computational and assessment methodologies in the field of RRfW.

While single CO2-based innovations are entering the markets, the possible economic effects of a large-scale CO2 utilization still remain unclear to policy makers and the public. Hence, this paper reviews the literature on CCU and provides insights on the motivations and potential of making use of recovered CO2 emissions as a commodity in the industrial production of materials and fuels. By analyzing data on current global CO2 supply from industrial sources, best practice benchmark capture costs and the demand potential of CO2 utilization and storage scenarios with comparative statics, conclusions can be drawn on the role of different CO2 sources. For near-term scenarios the demand for the commodity CO2 can be covered from industrial processes, that emit CO2 at a high purity and low benchmark capture cost of approximately 33 a,not sign/t. In the long-term, with synthetic fuel production and large-scale CO2 utilization, CO2 is likely to be available from a variety of processes at benchmark costs of approx. 65 a,not sign/t. Even if fossil-fired power generation is phased out, the CO2 emissions of current industrial processes would suffice for ambitious CCU demand scenarios. At current economic conditions, the business case for CO2 utilization is technology specific and depends on whether efficiency gains or substitution of volatile priced raw materials can be achieved. Overall, it is argued that CCU should be advanced complementary to mitigation technologies and can unfold its potential in creating local circular economy solutions.","[Naims, Henriette] IASS Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies eV, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany",,"Naims, H (corresponding author), IASS Inst Adv Sustainabil Studies eV, Berliner Str 130, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany.",henriette.naims@iass-potsdam.de,,,,,,,55,150,162,5,99,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

To address this issue, brine treatment seems to be a promising option to eliminate the wastewater discharge, while also recovering extra freshwater and valuable materials such as salts. This can be achieved through minimal liquid discharge (MLD) and zero liquid discharge (ZLD) strategies. In this work, MLD and ZLD frameworks are analyzed and evaluated under 9 criteria (framework stages, technologies, freshwater recovery target, feed brine salinity, energy consumption of each technology, GHGs emissions, cost impact, resource recovery and social impact). Moreover, a case-study is presented under two different scenarios, Scenario 1 (MLD system) and Scenario 2 (ZLD system). Results showed that the energy consumption of the ZLD system is 10.43 kW h/m(3) which is 1.93 times higher than the energy consumption of the MLD system (5.4 kW h/m(3)). The total freshwater recovery of the MLD system is 84.6 %, whereas the total freshwater recovery of the ZLD system is 98.15 %. Overall, the results suggest that the MLD and ZLD strategies can be valuable strategies for wastewater utilization, reuse, and resource recovery.","[Panagopoulos, Argyris; Haralambous, Katherine-Joanne] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Panagopoulos, A (corresponding author), Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech St, Athens 15780, Greece.",argyrispan@hotmail.com,"Panagopoulos, Argyris/AAG-8433-2019","Panagopoulos, Argyris/0000-0003-4889-6435",,,,,125,148,151,16,83,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2213-2929,2213-3437,,J ENVIRON CHEM ENG,J.

Product's repair and reuse, and component harvesting for reuse, all require the facilitated access to product components. Consequently, a reduction of the disassembly time and the related costs will increase the economic feasibility of product lifetime extension and therefore increase the viability of a circular economy in industrialised regions. Furthermore, disassembly has the potential to significantly increase the recycling yield and purity for precious metals, critical metals and plastics. For this reason, the European Commission and several ecolabels have considered to include design for disassembly requirements in legislation or voluntary environmental instruments. However, up to date, there is no standardised method to evaluate the ease of disassembly in an unambiguous manner with a good trade-off between the efforts required to apply the method and the accuracy of the determined disassembly time. The article proposes a robust method eDiM (ease of Disassembly Metric), to calculate the disassembly time based on the Maynard operation sequence technique (MOST). A straightforward calculation sheet is employed in eDiM to calculate the disassembly time given the sequence of actions and basic product information. This makes the results fully verifiable in an unambiguous manner, which makes eDiM suited to be used in policy measures in contrast to the results of prior developed methods One of the innovative aspects of eDiM is the categorization of disassembly tasks in six categories, which provides better insights on which disassembly tasks are the most time consuming and how the product design could be improved. The proposed method is illustrated by means of a case study of an LCD monitor. The presented case study demonstrates how the proposed method can be used in a policy context and how the calculated disassembly times per category can provide insights to manufacturers to improve the disassemblability of their products. The results also demonstrate how the proposed method can produce realistic results with only limited detail of input data.","[Vanegas, Paul; Peeters, Jef R.; Cattrysse, Dirk; Dewulf, Wim; Duflou, Joost R.] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Dept Mech Engn, Ctr Ind Management, Leuven, Belgium; [Vanegas, Paul] Univ Cuenca, Fac Engn, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Tecchio, Paolo; Ardente, Fulvio; Mathieux, Fabrice] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Directorate D Sustainable Resources, Ispra, Italy",KU Leuven; Universidad de Cuenca; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Mathieux, F (corresponding author), European Commiss, Join Res Ctr, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Ispra, Italy.",paul.vanegas@gmail.com; Fabrice.MATHIEUX@ec.europa.eu,"Duflou, Joost/AAM-1345-2020; Dewulf, Wim/D-6981-2018","Dewulf, Wim/0000-0002-9184-051X; Duflou, Joost/0000-0002-7265-9686","project Technical Support for Environmental Footprinting, Material Efficiency in Product Policy and the European Platform on LCA - [DG Environment]; SENESCYT","project Technical Support for Environmental Footprinting, Material Efficiency in Product Policy and the European Platform on LCA -; SENESCYT","This research was supported through the project Technical Support for Environmental Footprinting, Material Efficiency in Product Policy and the European Platform on LCA (2013-2016) funded by DG Environment.

Biological conversion of the gaseous compounds into a liquid fuel or chemical, preferably medium chain fatty acids (caproate and caprylate) is an attractive concept. This study for the first time demonstrated in-situ production of medium chain fatty acids from H-2 and CO2 in a hollow-fiber membrane biofilm reactor by mixed microbial culture. The hydrogen was for 100% utilized within the biofilms attached on the outer surface of the hollow-fiber membrane. The obtained concentrations of acetate, butyrate, caproate and caprylate were 7.4, 1.8, 0.98 and 0.42 g/L, respectively. The biomass specific production rate of caproate (31.4 mmol-C/(L day g-biomass)) was similar to literature reports for suspended cell cultures while for caprylate the rate (19.1 mmol-C/(L day g-biomass)) was more than 6 times higher. Microbial community analysis showed the biofilms were dominated by Clostridium spp., such as Clostridium ljungdahlii and Clostridium kluyveri.

This treaty mandates that parties who have signed must take administrative and legislative actions to prevent the environmental impacts that POPs pose, both within their jurisdictions and in the global environment. The specific BFRs listed in the Stockholm Convention are Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs), Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCDD), and Hexabromobiphenyl (HBB), chemicals which must therefore be heavily restricted within the jurisdictions of the signatories. As an example, within the EU, hexabromobiphenyl (HBB), the PBDE commercial mixtures, and HBCDD are almost entirely prohibited in terms of both production and use in commercial goods. Waste articles containing excess concentrations of these BFRs are similarly restricted and must be disposed of in a manner that destroys or irreversible transforms the BFR in question. In some cases, specific exemptions for these limits are defined by the Convention for certain parties: for example, Penta- and Octa-BDE can be present in waste materials for recycling until 2030, while Deca-BDE can be applied to some aviation and automotive applications until 2036. However, in such cases, very specific criteria and guidelines apply for their use and/or production. Worldwide, China, Japan, India, and the United States of America have made significant advances in the regulation of POPs, in line with the provisions of the Stockholm Convention. China has established concentration limits for Penta- and Octa-BDEs in electronic goods. It is also currently availing of an exemption to allow for the use of HBCDD and has not yet ratified the Convention with regards to Deca-BDE. Japan meanwhile has classified HBB and Penta-/Octa-BDE compounds as Class I Specified Chemical Substances which virtually prohibits the manufacture, import, and use of these chemicals in all applications. India has banned the manufacture, trade, import, and use of HBB, HBCDD and some PBDEs, and has established concentration limits for all PBDEs in certain electrical goods. Finally, the United States has no federal mandate for the restriction of POPs and has not ratified the annexes to the Convention requiring them to do so. However, thirteen states have implemented their own state-wide concentration limits on a variety of flame retarding chemicals in various commercial applications. Though these limits worldwide are a very positive step for the removal of POP-BFRs from the environment, the increased use of replacement flame retardants renders such legislation only partially effective. The lack of effective screening mechanisms in waste management facilities means that BFR-treated plastics can be inadvertently recycled and remain in circulation. The rise in the use of novel BFRs (NBFRs) can furthermore hinder screening methods currently being developed and the additives themselves may pose similar issues to their predecessors owing to their similar chemical properties. Thus, restrictions on current BFRs will result in the use of new flame retardants, which may in turn be banned and replaced once again. Further research into and development of methods to screen for hazardous chemicals in end of life materials is therefore of the utmost importance. This must be coupled with pro-active legislation that eliminates the need for using such persistent and potentially harmful chemicals in the future.","[Sharkey, Martin; Berresheim, Harald] Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Phys, Univ Rd, Galway H91 CF50, Ireland; [Harrad, Stuart; Abdallah, Mohamed Abou-Elwafa; Drage, Daniel S.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Geog Earth & Environm Sci, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Abdallah, Mohamed Abou-Elwafa] Assiut Univ, Dept Analyt Chem, Fac Pharm, Assiut 72516, Egypt",University of Birmingham; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Assiut University,"Sharkey, M (corresponding author), Natl Univ Ireland Galway, Sch Phys, Univ Rd, Galway H91 CF50, Ireland.",martin.sharkey@nuigalway.ie,"Abdallah, Mohamed Abou-Elwafa/P-8813-2014","Abdallah, Mohamed Abou-Elwafa/0000-0002-4624-4073; Sharkey, Martin/0000-0002-2359-5591; Drage, Daniel/0000-0001-7190-4697",,,,,80,147,160,27,143,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0160-4120,1873-6750,,ENVIRON INT,Environ.

It has become important for EIPs to quantitatively evaluate the CE performance of the production chain while also seeking specific measures that could promote resources utilization efficiency. In this paper, we combine the substance flow analysis (SFA) approach with the resource productivity (RP) indicator to evaluate the contribution of IS to the development of circular economy. Through questionnaires and field surveys of key enterprises in Suzhou New District (SND), a substance flow analysis and resource productivity indicator were developed for core materials (copper, water and energy) in printed circuit boards (PCB) production under the excluding waste utilization scenario and including waste utilization scenario. The results show that the RPCu of chain from electrolytic copper production enterprises (ECPE) to electrolytic copper foil production enterprises is respectively 21.38 and 23.15 thousand yuan per ton, from ECPE to copper clad laminate (CCL) production enterprises is respectively 64.15 and 71.32 thousand yuan per ton, and from ECPE to PCB production enterprises is respectively 176.47 and 211.21 thousand yuan per ton under the two scenarios. RP is enhanced by prolonging the industrial production chain and the RP under the excluding waste utilization scenario is higher than the including waste utilization scenario for the same chain, which can be achieved through greater IS. Finally we propose further implications on developing CE in EIPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach This study uses data collected through an online survey distributed to managers of 378 Italian firms that have adopted circular economy principles. The data are processed using multiple regression analysis. Findings The results indicate that the three categories of circular economy practices investigated - namely circular economy supply chain management design, circular economy supply chain relationship management and circular economy HR management - play a crucial role in enhancing firm performance from a circular economy perspective. A big-data-driven supply chain acts as a moderator of the relationship between circular economy HR management and firm performance for a circular economy supply chain. Originality/value This study makes a number of original contributions to research on circular economy practices in a big-data-driven supply chain and provides useful insights for practitioners. First, it answers the call to capture digital transformation trends and to extend research on sustainability in supply chain management. Second, it enhances the literature by investigating the relationships between three different kinds of circular economy supply chain practices and firm performance.

This is of particular urgency in fast-emerging economies, where economic development induces massive construction without the capacity to manage the associated waste. This paper reports lessons learned from Shenzhen, China, which has witnessed exciting economic growth in the past few decades but also been compelled to rapidly develop an effective C&D waste circular economy from a low base. The research adopts a mixed-method approach combining case study, site investigations, and interviews in Shenzhen. It is discovered that Shenzhen's success can be attributed to (a) implementing strong governmental interventions; (b) developing a thriving C&D waste recycling market; (c) introducing advanced recycling technologies; and (d) enacting responsive institutional arrangements. Further improvements related to (1) recycled product certification, (2) land use and economic subsidies, and (3) changing circular economy philosophies, inter alia, are desired to sustain the long-term prosperity of this circular economy. The research provides a reference which can be adapted to the unique context of other emerging economies in developing effective circularity. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Given an estimated lifetime of 30 years, the challenge of how to handle large volumes of end-of-life PV modules is starting to emerge. In this Perspective, we assess the global status of practice and knowledge for end-of-life management for crystalline silicon PV modules. We focus in particular on module recycling, a key aspect in the circular economy of photovoltaic panels. We recommend research and development to reduce recycling costs and environmental impacts compared to disposal while maximizing material recovery. We suggest that the recovery of high-value silicon is more advantageous than the recovery of intact silicon wafers. This approach requires the identification of contaminants and the design of purification processes for recovered silicon. The environmental and economic impacts of recycling practices should be explored with techno-economic analyses and life-cycle assessments to optimize solutions and minimize trade-offs. As photovoltaic technology advances rapidly, it is important for the recycling industry to plan adaptable recycling infrastructure.

Two different consumers' purchase intentions were analysed: consumers were asked both if they would be willing to buy WTV food and if they would buy WTV food if this would help to reduce the environmental impact of agricultural production. Binary logistic regressions are estimated to appraise the eventual drivers of consumers' statements. Among these drivers, attention was given to aspects related to the generalised aversion to new foods, i.e. food neophobia (FN) and the aversion to food processed in new ways, i.e. food technology neophobia (FTN). Other relevant economic and demographic factors were investigated, together with aspects related to generalised trust, purchase behaviours and preferences. The main results indicate that 56% of respondents declared to be willing to buy WTV food, however, FN and FTN negatively influence the probability of stating a positive purchase intention. Consumers who give importance to reading food labels and think that food could have environmental or health benefits, are more likely to be willing to buy WTV food. In addition, a core of sustainable consumers seems to emerge who express a positive purchase intention for WTV food to reduce the environmental impact of production and give importance to the origin and nutritional values of products. In conclusion, policy implications are drawn. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering current and future developments, GFRP waste amounts from the wind industry are expected to increase. Therefore, a sustainable process is needed for dealing with wind turbines at the end of their service life in order to maximize the environmental benefits of wind power. Most components of a wind turbine such as the foundation, tower, gear box and generator are already recyclable and treated accordingly. Nevertheless, wind turbine blades represent a challenge due to the type of materials used and their complex composition. There are a number of ways to treat GFRP waste, depending on the intended application. The best available waste treatment technologies in Europe are outlined in this paper. However, there is a lack of practical experiences in applying secondary materials in new products. A Danish innovation consortium was addressing this waste with a predominant focus on the blades from the wind power industry. The outcomes from the consortium and the various tested tools are presented in this paper as well as the secondary applications that were proposed. The outcomes are structured using Ellen MacArthur's circular economy diagram. The adjusted diagram illustrates the potentials for a continuous flow of composite materials through the value circle, where secondary applications were developed in respect to reuse, resize and reshape, recycle, recover and 'conversion'. This included applications for architectural purposes, consumer goods, and industrial filler material. By presenting the outcomes of the consortium, new insights are provided into potential forms of reuse of composites and the practical challenges that need to be addressed.","[Jensen, J.

In this context, cities are implementing a number of initiatives that aim to turn them into sustainable circular systems. Whether these initiatives achieve their sustainability goals, however, is largely unknown. Nevertheless, as the application of CE strategies is actively encouraged by many policies across the globe, there is a need to quantify the environmental impacts and to identify the strategies that support urban sustainability. This paper analyses the extent to which research focuses on quantifying the environmental balance of CE initiatives promoted at the municipal level. To this end, the analysis scanned CE initiatives reported in cities around the globe and classified them into urban targets and CE strategies. In parallel, the paper conducted a review of the literature that uses industrial ecology tools to account for the environmental impacts of CE strategies. Results show a diverse geographical representation, as reported cities concentrated in Europe, whereas for environmental research, the main results came from China. In general, cities encourage strategies relating to urban infrastructure (47%), with and additional focus on social consumption aspects, such as repair and reuse actions. In comparison, research mainly addressed industrial and business practices (58%), but the approach to infrastructure was similar to that of cities, both with a special interest in waste management. Research has yet to assess social consumption and urban planning strategies, the latter essential for defining the impacts of other urban elements. Hence, there is a need to define the environmental impacts of the strategies that cities select in their quest for circularity. Research and practice can also benefit from working collaboratively so as to prioritize the CE strategies that best fit into the features of each urban area. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Unfortunately, increasing copper extraction and decreasing ore grades intensify energy use and generate higher environmental impact. A potential solution would be reaching a circular economy of copper, in which secondary production provides a large part of the demand. A necessary first step in this direction is to understand future copper demand. In this study, we estimated the copper demand until 2100 under different scenarios with regression and stock dynamics methods. For the stock dynamics method, a strong growth of copper demand is found in the scenarios with a high share of renewable energy, in which a much higher copper intensity for the electricity system and the transport sector is seen. The regression predicts a wider range of copper demand depending on the scenario. The regression method requires less data but lacks the ability to incorporate the expected decoupling of material use and GDP when the stock saturates, limiting its applicability for long-term estimations. Under all considered scenarios, the projected increase in demand for copper results in the exhaustion of the identified copper resources, unless high end-of-life recovery rates are achieved. These results highlight the urgency for a transition towards the circular economy of copper.","[Schipper, Branco W.; Lin, Hsiu-Chuan; Meloni, Marco A.; Heijungs, Reinout; van der Voet, Ester] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Einsteinweg 2, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands; [Heijungs, Reinout] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Schipper, Branco W.; Lin, Hsiu-Chuan; Meloni, Marco A.] Delft Univ Technol, Fac Technol Policy & Management, Jaffalaan 5, NL-2628 BX Delft, Netherlands; [Wansleeben, Kjell] Municipal Pijnacker Nootdorp, Dept Spatial Planning, Oranjepl 1, NL-2641 EZ Pijnacker, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Delft University of Technology,"Schipper, BW (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci, Einsteinweg 2, NL-2333 CC Leiden, Netherlands.",b.w.schipper@umail.leidenuniv.nl,"Heijungs, Reinout/K-7855-2013; van der Voet, Ester/K-8210-2013","Heijungs, Reinout/0000-0002-0724-5962; van der Voet, Ester/0000-0003-0788-9570",,,,,47,145,156,16,107,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Here, I attempt to provide analytical guidance by defining the sharing economy as the practice that consumers grant each other temporary access to their under-utilized physical assets. Using this definition, the rise of the sharing economy can be understood as occurring at the intersection of three salient economic trends: peer-topeer exchange, access over ownership and circular business models. I shortly discuss some of the environmental impacts of online sharing platforms and then articulate three possible futures of the sharing economy: a capitalist future cumulating in monopolistic super-platforms allowing for seamless services, a state-led future that shifts taxation from labour to capital and redistributes the gains of sharing from winners to losers, and a citizen-led future based on cooperatively owned platforms under democratic control.

The evolutionary process of a circular economy in China, from introduction of the concept and the relevant actions of national decision making to demonstration of the system nationwide, has taken only around 6 years, with strong encouragement from politicians and the urgent need to cope with environmental pollution and a severe shortage of natural resources. The circular economy in China is now being actively implemented at three levels: enterprises, eco-industrial parks, and regions. The consolidated theoretical bases of ecology and economics have helped the circular economy to define its position as a new economic model to effectively resolve the problems of resources and the environment. In this regard, material flow management is naturally a unique planning and management method for implementation of a circular economy, and eco-efficiency is a good indicator to measure circular economic activities. Of particular significance has been initiation of the legislative process for the Circular Economy Law, which is among a number of initiatives developing core policies for a circular economy in China. Stringent enforcement of a set of policies for energy saving and pollution abatement nowadays in China will certainly create an enabling environment for the development of a circular economy.","State Environm Protect Adm China SEPA, PRCEE, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",,"Yong, R (corresponding author), State Environm Protect Adm China SEPA, PRCEE, 1 Yuhui Nanlu, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China.",Ren.yong@prcee.org,,,,,,,17,144,155,9,130,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1438-4957,,,J MATER CYCLES WASTE,J.

Design/methodology/approach Grounded in multiple organizational theories, this paper develops a theoretical framework for identifying relevant barriers to integrating circular economy philosophy in food supply chain management. The study uses 105 responses from Chinese food supply chain stakeholders including food processors, sales and distribution channels, consumers and government officials. It applies a fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method to examine the causal-effect relationships among the identified barriers. Findings Overall, the results suggest two key cause barriers: first, weak environmental regulations and enforcement, and second, lack of market preference/pressure. Meanwhile, lack of collaboration/support from supply chain actors is the most prominent barrier. The key cause and prominent barriers are also identified for each of the supply chain stakeholder involved. Research implications - The study offers practical insights for overcoming barriers to integrating circular economy philosophy in the management of supply chains in the Chinese food sector, as well as in other contexts where similar challenges are faced. It also sheds light on which organizational theories are most suitable for guiding similar studies.

Besides contributing to more sustainable and circular economies, those products also have high commercial value when compared to the ones obtained by currently used waste treatment methods. In this paper, it is shown how the bio-refinery framework can be used to obtain high value products from organic waste. With spent coffee grounds as a case study, a sequential process is used to obtain first the most valuable, and then other products, allowing proper valorization of residues and increased sustainability of the whole process.

Polymer materials have been found an application in many areas of daily life and industry. Along with their extended use, the problem of plastic wastes appeared because, after withdrawal from use, they became persistent and noxious wastes. The possibility of reusing polymeric materials gives a possibility of valorization-a second life-and enables effective waste utilization to obtain consumable products. The 3D printing market is a well-growing sector. Printable filaments can be made from a variety of thermoplastic materials, including those from recycling. This paper focuses on a review of the available literature on the production of filaments for 3D printers from recycled polymers as the alternative to present approach of central selective collection of plastics. The possibility of recycling of basic thermoplastic materials and the impact of processing on their physicochemical and mechanical properties were verified (Lanzotti et al.2019). In addition, commercially available filaments produced from recycled materials and devices which allow self-production of filaments to 3D printing from plastic waste were reviewed.","[Mikula, Katarzyna; Skrzypczak, Dawid; Izydorczyk, Grzegorz; Warchol, Jolanta; Chojnacka, Katarzyna; Witek-Krowiak, Anna] Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Chem, Dept Adv Mat Technol, Smoluchowskiego 25, PL-50372 Wroclaw, Poland; [Moustakas, Konstantinos] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Chem Engn, 9 Iroon Polytech Str,Zographou Campus, GR-15780 Athens, Greece",Wroclaw University of Science & Technology; National Technical University of Athens,"Mikula, K (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Chem, Dept Adv Mat Technol, Smoluchowskiego 25, PL-50372 Wroclaw, Poland.",katarzyna.mikula@pwr.edu.pl,"Witek-Krowiak, Anna/JHU-4689-2023; Chojnacka, Katarzyna/HJA-3004-2022; Witek-Krowiak, Anna/AGA-9126-2022","Witek-Krowiak, Anna/0000-0001-5706-0133; Chojnacka, Katarzyna/0000-0001-6897-9882; Witek-Krowiak, Anna/0000-0001-5706-0133; Skrzypczak, Dawid/0000-0001-7591-1819; Reis, AlessanRSS/0000-0001-8486-7469; Mikula, Katarzyna/0000-0001-9553-4977; Izydorczyk, Grzegorz/0000-0003-1484-8857",Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education [8201003902/K26W03D05],"Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education(Ministry of Science and Higher Education, Poland)",The work was financed by a statutory activity subsidy from the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education for the Faculty of Chemistry of Wroclaw University of Science and Technology number 8201003902/K26W03D05.,,61,142,146,8,82,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

This study examines the impact of (a) circular eco-innovations and (b) external funding available for CE activities on the growth of European SMEs using a data set of 5,100 SMEs across 28 European countries in 2016. Findings reveal that a significant threshold investment (i.e., higher than 10% of revenues) into circular eco-innovations is required for SMEs to benefit from investing into the CE. Moreover, the majority of circular eco-innovations fail to boost the growth rates of SMEs, with the exception of investments into eco-design innovations. Although traditional forms of debt and grant finance targeted to CE activities are found to have no or negative impact on the growth of SMEs, equity finance (i.e., angel and venture capital investments) contributes positively to their growth.

How companies can exploit the opportunities of CE to position themselves better are not well articulated in the literature. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to identify the barriers and opportunities of CE in the manufacturing sector through a socio-political, economic, legal and environmental perspective. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a positivist approach, which is deductive in nature. A survey questionnaire was designed and distributed to manufacturing companies operating in the UK and EU. The study used FAME database and social networking platform LinkedIn to identify manufacturing companies. More than 200+ companies were approached for this study and data collection lasted over two months. Findings The study provides a comprehensive review of the CE literature and identifies a number of barriers and opportunities to CE implementation from a socio-political, economic, legal and environmental perspective. The findings highlight key barriers, opportunities and benefits of CE for the manufacturing industries operating in the UK and EU. Research limitations/ implications - The findings are limited to 63 responses from the survey questionnaire distributed to manufacturing companies in the UK and EU. The present study aims to equip manufacturers with necessary understanding of the key opportunities and barriers to address the challenges encountered during the implementation of CE. Originality/value This study adds to the limited empirical literature on CE barriers and opportunities to manufacturing organisations operating in the UK and EU. The paper also identifies barriers and opportunities of CE from a socio-political, economic, legal and environmental lens.","[Kumar, Vikas] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Operat & Supply Chain Management, Bristol, Avon, England; [Sezersan, Ihsan] Univ Warwick, WMG, Engn Business Management, Coventry, W Midlands, England; [Garza-Reyes, Jose Arturo] Univ Derby, Ctr Supply Chain Improvement, Derby, England; [Gonzalez, Ernesto D.

By reviewing the field's main theories, we illustrate significant implications for how future research can study profitability and competitiveness in the circular economy. This paper introduces the central components of circular business models and discusses links to contingency theory, transaction cost theory, resource-based theory, theory on networks and industrial economics, and agency theory. Understanding the circular economy and the ways companies can compete in the circular economy based on these theories is important for establishing important new research directions for scholars of sustainable business and circular business models.","[Lahti, Tom] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Management & Org, Vaasa 65101, Finland; [Wincent, Joakim] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Management & Org, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Wincent, Joakim; Parida, Vinit] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Wincent, Joakim] Univ St Gallen, Inst Technol Management, Global Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat, CH-9000 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Parida, Vinit] Univ Vaasa, Dept Management, Vaasa 65200, Finland",Hanken School of Economics; Hanken School of Economics; Lulea University of Technology; University of St Gallen; University of Vaasa,"Parida, V (corresponding author), Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.;Parida, V (corresponding author), Univ Vaasa, Dept Management, Vaasa 65200, Finland.",tom.lahti@hanken.fi; joakim.wincent@ltu.se; vinit.parida@ltu.se,"Parida, Vinit/ABA-5703-2021","Parida, Vinit/0000-0003-3255-414X",,,,,103,142,151,6,151,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2018,10,8,,,,,,,2799,10.3390/su10082799,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10082799,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3CI,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000446767700215,View Full Record in Web of Science

The authors provide insights from a U.S.-based empirical study that involved 12 companies and examined the emerging drivers, current challenges and future opportunities for advancing waste repurposing and product reuse. Many large companies fail to incorporate CE principles into their business strategy due to lack of mandates, costs, logistical hurdles and inertia. This presents an opportunity for entrepreneurial companies with innovative business models to fill the gap and provide critical links for corporations in reverse supply chains while creating new business opportunities with social benefits. The study found that despite the lack of federal regulations in the U.S. a growing number of corporations are partnering with entrepreneurs to reduce waste and advance product reuse. Key drivers for such trends include sustainability commitments and zero waste goals by companies and municipalities, European Union and U.S. state mandates, reputation and the growing focus on local sourcing. Technology, knowledge, and strategic partnerships between entrepreneurs and corporations play a critical role in reducing financial costs, time, energy, environmental impacts and resources, thus helping establish viable business models. The authors propose a new framework for corporate-entrepreneur collaborations to advance a CE. The study contributes to the research on the relationship between entrepreneurial innovation and the development of CE principles within corporate supply chains, a field that is still in its infant stage.

We draw on the organizational sense making literature to identify the organizational enablers of circular supply chains and their relationships with the environmental performance of supply chains. Data was collected from various supply chains within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was adopted to test the hypothesis derived from a systematic review of the literature. Originality of this work stems from the conceptualisation and validation of a framework for circular supply chains and sustainable performance as a combination of process facilitators and a persuasive organizational narrative that enables organizations to embrace the circular economy practices. The validated framework has implications for both academia and the industry because of its emphasis on the joint effects of a) the discursive ability of organizational actors to articulate a paradigm shift towards circular supply chains b) the process facilitators comprising of actions and practices that enable circular supply chains.

Following the circular economy principles, this waste should ideally be avoided, and if not possible, treated to recover resources. This paper considers the life cycle environmental and economic implications of recovering energy and material resources from food waste, focusing on the UK situation. Four treatment methods are considered: anaerobic digestion, in-vessel composting, incineration and landfilling. The results show that per tonne of waste treated, anaerobic digestion has the lowest environmental impacts in 13 out of the 19 categories considered in the study, including net-negative global warming potential. In-vessel composting is the least sustainable option environmentally, in contrast to being preferred over incineration according to the circular economy principles. Incineration has the lowest life cycle costs (71 pound/t), while landfilling is the costliest option (123 pound/t). Managing the 4.9 Mt of food waste collected annually from UK households via the four methods generates 340,000 t CO(2)( )eq. and costs 452 pound m, in addition to causing a number of other environmental impacts. However, it also saves 1.9 PJ of primary energy, primarily due to electricity generation through incineration. If all of this food waste was incinerated, 103 pound m and 360.000 t CO2 eq./year could be saved compared to current waste management, rendering incineration a carbon-negative technology. This would also result in savings in 14 other impacts, but would increase summer smog by 30% and metal depletion by 56%. The environmental benefits of incineration would be exceeded only if all food waste was treated by anaerobic digestion, which would save 490,000 t CO2 eq./year and produce 50% more electricity per tonne of waste than incineration. Anaerobic digestion would also lead to savings in 14 other impacts compared to the present situation, but would result in a four times higher acidification and three times greater emissions of particulate matter. In addition, it would save 251 pound m/year compared to the current costs. Nevertheless, prevention of avoidable food waste would realise far greater environmental and economic savings, estimated here at 14 Mt CO2 eq. and 10.7 pound bn annually. (C) 2019 The Authors.

However, plastic from household waste (HHW) is a heterogeneous and contaminated resource, leading to recycled plastic with reduced quality, limiting the potential for closed-loop recycling. In addition to regulatory requirements for the chemical composition of recycled plastic, reduced physical and mechanical properties may limit the potential for closed-loop recycling. Consequently, this study analyses the thermal degradation, processability and mechanical properties of a range of reprocessed PET, PE and PP samples from source-separated plastic in HHW. On this basis, the potential for closed-loop recycling is evaluated. The study demonstrated that PET, PE and PP recycling represent different challenges. Potential degradation of the PET polymer can be reversed in a decontamination process, making PET waste well-suited for closed-loop, multiple times recycling, even when the degree of heterogeneity in the waste is high. The processability of different kinds of PE and PP packaging types varied considerably, especially for PP. Consequently, current recycling of mixed PP waste and even separate recycling of individual PP waste packaging types, will not technically facilitate recycling into new packaging products. This highlights the importance of PE and PP waste homogeneity when sent to reprocessing. Such homogeneity may be achieved through additional plastic sorting and regulatory harmonisation of product design, accounting for polymer properties and recyclability. Degradation of PP during recycling was shown to be substantial, representing another important limitation for PP recycling, necessary to address in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

With a national utilization rate of 80% in 2015, there is still a large amount of straw burned in open-field, resulting in air pollution and a reduction in the quantity available as a source of bioenergy. This paper conducts a literature review of success stories and major challenges in comprehensive straw utilization in and out of China. It is noted that nationwide long-term feasible and sustainable straw utilization at a high rate is a highly complex operation, involving most societal sectors, many people and facilities often at different regions. Scenarios were analyzed to estimate the energy potential and air emission reductions China would accomplish in 2020 by converting an additional 5 or 10% of straw-yield to biofuel. Currently, the approach to control straw burning in China is primarily administrative, relying heavily on prohibition and penalties, inconsistent across policy areas and geography, and lacking in long-term planning. Consequently, the effectiveness of the current approach is limited. The main cause of burning is a lack of infrastructure, effective preventive measures, and viable alternatives. Recommendations aimed at promoting a circular bio-economy around using crop straw as resources were provided, including improving straw utilization rates and reducing open-field burning.","[Ren, Jiqin; Yu, Peixian] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, 15 East Rd North Third Ring, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China; [Xu, Xiaohong] Univ Windsor, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada",Beijing University of Chemical Technology; University of Windsor,"Xu, XH (corresponding author), Univ Windsor, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 401 Sunset Ave, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.",renjq@mail.buct.edu.cn; 2015200865@mail.buct.edu.cn; xxu@uwindsor.ca,,,National Program on Key Research Project of China [2016YFF0204405]; National Social Science Foundation of China [16BGL007]; Beijing Social Science Foundation of China [18GLB029]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,National Program on Key Research Project of China; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Beijing Social Science Foundation of China; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),"This research was funded by the National Program on Key Research Project of China (Grant No. 2016YFF0204405), the National Social Science Foundation of China (grant number 16BGL007), the Beijing Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 18GLB029), and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",,76,140,146,57,391,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 23,2019,11,6,,,,,,,1762,10.3390/su11061762,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11061762,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HT1WH,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000464354700011,View Full Record in Web of Science

To achieve sustainable consumption in a circular economy production and consumption practices need to change. Business models can potentially influence both practices as it defines how a company conducts business and shapes the company-consumer relationship. This paper developed future business models for sustainable consumption through two rounds of semi-structured interviews with experts from academia, industry, and policy. During the first interview round, four business model elements that are important for sustainable consumption were identified: Resource strategy, Revenue model, Consumer effort, and Objective to (decrease/increase) consumption level. Based on these elements, we developed a comprehensive business model framework. Using this framework, experts envisioned future business models for sustainable consumption of clothing during the second interview round. The findings of this study suggest that the most promising business models for sustainable consumption are those that reduce overall consumption levels and consumer effort. Further, we found that a diverse range of business models in the market can potentially enable different customer segments to consume sustainably. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Starting from a general overview of the emerging trends today affecting the fashion industry, the paper will devote particular attention to the analysis of the most important phenomena that are influencing this market and the drivers for long-lasting competitiveness: sustainability and attention to the so-called circular economy. According to the literature, from the consumer behavior's point of view, the younger generations are paying growing attention to these issues. In light of these considerations, this paper aimed to analyze how sustainability and circular economy principles are influencing the perception of the fashion world among the new generations of consumers. After mapping the emerging trends in the fashion industry and analyzing the role of sustainability from both the demand and supply side, this paper presents the results of a survey conducted through an anonymous questionnaire made in collaboration with Insubria University. The results of the survey describe the students' behaviour as regards fashion's emerging trends, with particular attention to sustainability issues and the application of circular economy principles. The survey results were analyzed from both a descriptive and quantitative point of view with the aim to check the different perceptions as regards sustainable fashion and circular economy in fashion, focusing mainly on the so-called Generation Z. The results of the analysis proved to be consistent with the theoretical framework and confirm the relevance of sustainability issues in the fashion industry today in driving the demand of Generation Z, by considering a gender perspective.

This study assessed the beneficial application of biochar to soil to recycle digestate nutrients, improve soil quality, and reduce conventional chemical fertilizer. The addition of digestate-enriched biochar improved soil quality as it provided higher soil organic matter (232%-514%) and macronutrients (110%-230%) as opposed to the unenriched biochar and control treatments. Maize grown in soil amended with digestate-enriched biochar showed a significantly higher biomass yield compared to the control and non-enriched biochar treatments but was slightly lower than yields from chemical fertilizer treatments. The slightly lower yield (20%-25%) achieved from digestate-enriched biochar was attributed to slower mineralization and release of the adsorbed nutrients in the short term. However, digestate-enriched biochar could in the long term become more beneficial in sustaining soil fertility through maintaining high soil organic matter and the gradual release of micronutrients compared to conventional chemical fertilizer. Positive effects on soil micronutrients, macronutrients, organic matter, and biomass yield indicates that enriched biochar could partly replace chemical fertilizers and promote organic farming in a circular economy concept.","[Kizito, Simon; Luo, Hongzhen; Lu, Jiaxin; Dong, Renjie] China Agr Univ, Coll Engn, Key Lab Clean Utilizat Technol Renewable Energy, Minist Agr, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Kizito, Simon] Makerere Univ, Coll Agr & Environm Sci, Sch Forestry Environm & Geog Sci, POB 7062, Kampala, Uganda; [Bah, Hamidou] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Wu, Shubiao] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark","China Agricultural University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Makerere University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mountain Hazards & Environment, CAS; Aarhus University","Wu, SB (corresponding author), Aarhus Univ, Aarhus Inst Adv Studies, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",saviokizito@gmail.com; luohongzhen@cau.edu.cn; lujiaxinamy@foxmail.com; bahamidou2004@gmail.com; rjdong@cau.edu.cn; wushubiao@gmail.com,"Wu, Shubiao/AAA-5324-2020; Bah, Hamidou/AAV-9268-2020; SIMON, KIZITO/AAV-6493-2020; Luo, Hongzhen/AFV-1167-2022","Wu, Shubiao/0000-0003-1203-0680; Bah, Hamidou/0000-0002-9572-1446; Luo, Hongzhen/0000-0003-0345-0018","project of Research Fund for International Young Scientist [51650110489]; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration [609033]","project of Research Fund for International Young Scientist; European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration(European Union (EU))","This research was funded by the project of Research Fund for International Young Scientist (51650110489).

In this paper, based on the introduction of the concept of energy consumption status in China's key energy-consuming process industries, the main technical bottlenecks and resource-environment problems were analyzed with special emphasis on energy utilization efficiency, energy consumption mode, and waste emission. As for the measures to resolve these problems, at the policy level, policies and programs of Chinese government related to energy conservation were introduced in combination with China's circular economy structure. At the technical level, the key technologies and research progress to improve energy utilization efficiency, reducing energy consumption, as well as utilizing the resource of discharged wastes were reviewed. Finally, three typical cases of the development of circular economy at three levels, namely the chemical industry, metallurgical industry, and electric power industry, were studied for the enforcement of circular economy and energy conservation in China's process industries.

This is evident in some initiatives taken to create cities with low to zero carbon emissions, build sustainable structures and create higher institutions of learning where sustainability practices are entrenched in their curricula. Examples of the forerunners of sustainable cities are abound; from the Middle East (Education City in Qatar and Masdar City in Abu Dhabi) to Far East (Dongtan Institute in China and New Songdo City in South Korea), new cities imbued with sustainability practices are springing forth. There are 400 big cities and 23 mega cities presently occupying the world urban spaces, with estimates of about one and 10 million inhabitants, respectively. Ironically cities occupy about 2% of the earth surface, they however consume 60-80% of global energy. The global urban population rose from 220 million to about 2.8 billion in the 20th century, and it is projected that by 2050, this will increase to 6.9 billion, which is about 70% of the world population. Therefore, sustainability campaigns, when directed at cities, would have intended impacts due to a number of factors associated with cities: large population, hub of intellectual and social integration, high consumption, etc. In creating modern sustainable cities however, the attention of cities' planners and policymakers alike should be on those goals that come under the banner of sustainability, especially when designing new or retrofitting existing human settlements (the cities); such as human capital development, energy conservation and energy efficiency, water security, efficient use of earth abundant resources, transportation, building standards, social and economic equity, and food wastes management. Although there are few review articles in the literature that separately deal with individual sustainability fundamentals, there is a dearth of publication consolidating key sustainability principles required for modern cities. This paper reviewed each element needed to make a functional sustainable city. We adopted a simple approach; we explained each sustainability principle, highlighted its core values and gave reasons why it is an important candidate to be considered in making a working city. We critiqued the current sustainable cities by stating reasons for their strengths and explanations for their deficiencies. We engaged the future sustainable cities' planners to learn from the failures of some of the earlier hurriedly executed sustainable cities in order to have the most important elements of sustain ability present in their future project execution.

Both ecological and health assessments were evaluated using GI (geo-accumulation index) and NPI (Nemerow pollution index), and associated health risk was assessed by using USEPA model. According to the ecological risk assessment, Cu, Sb, Cd, Zn and Co were seriously enriched in the soil of the studied area. The health risk assessment proposed by USEPA indicated no significant health risks to the population. Soil properties, such as pH and organic matter, were found to correlate with the enrichment of heavy metals. Arsenic concentrations in the soil were found positively correlated to dead bacteria concentrations. Spatial distribution of heavy metals revealed that Ziya Circular Economy Park was the dominant pollution source in the studied area.

C&D waste should be managed throughout the construction cycle. The concept of circular economy (CE) is an emerging notion that has the potential to be utilized as waste minimization approach. This paper aims to assess the potentials of incorporating the CE concept as an approach to minimizing C&D wastes, by developing a CE-based theoretical framework for C&D waste management in Malaysia. In line with this objective, a systematic review has been conducted to determine how CE can be operationalised as a strategy to minimize wastes, while considering it as a key factor for mitigating the environmental impacts. Based on the literature review, a CE-based theoretical framework has been proposed using Malaysia as a case study. The framework has been developed following a three-layer approach namely micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. Waste minimization strategies have been identified for each level taking into account the main stages in the construction industry, i.e., planning, designing, procurement, construction, and demolition. The different stakeholders involved at each stage and their interactions in the stages have also been identified.","[Esa, Mohd Reza; Halog, Anthony] Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Esa, Mohd Reza] Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Architecture Planning & Surveying, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia; [Rigamonti, Lucia] Politecn Milan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Environm Sect, Milan, Italy",University of Queensland; Universiti Teknologi MARA; Polytechnic University of Milan,"Esa, MR (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sch Geog Planning & Environm Management, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.;Esa, MR (corresponding author), Univ Teknol MARA, Fac Architecture Planning & Surveying, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia.",m.esa@uq.edu.au,"rigamonti, lucia/E-3943-2016; Halog, Anthony Basco/I-6718-2012","rigamonti, lucia/0000-0001-5468-9577; Halog, Anthony Basco/0000-0002-0404-0670",Malaysian Ministry of Education; Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM),Malaysian Ministry of Education; Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM),The authors would like to thank the Malaysian Ministry of Education and Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) for providing financial support in pursuing this research project.,,65,138,141,6,115,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1438-4957,1611-8227,,J MATER CYCLES WASTE,J.

However, there are barriers to these changes that organizations should consider. Both Industry 4.0 transition, in other words Industry 3.5, and circularity transition require great efforts to deal with these barriers; in the current environment, organizations need to deal with these barriers simultaneously for more sustainable resource management. This study focuses in particular on circular supply chains in the Industry 3.5 stage. There are some studies that suggest barriers to Industry 4.0 and circular supply chains separately, none of these studies consider them together. From this point of view, this study contributes to existing literature by presenting synchronized barriers that integrate circular supply chain and Industry 4.0 barriers.

The former results in net negative greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (-39 kg CO2-eq./t) and primary energy demand (-2 GJ/t) due to the displacement of grid electricity and mineral fertilisers. AD has lower impacts than both incineration and landfilling across 15 of the 19 impacts. However, the application of digestate to land and the release of ammonia and nitrates lead to higher marine eutrophication (ME), terrestrial acidification (TA) and particulate matter formation (PMF). For the second functional unit, AD electricity emits 203 kg CO2-eq./MWh, compared to 357 kg CO2-eq./MWh for the UK grid mix. Compared to renewables, such as wind and solar, AD electricity has lower energy demand, toxicity potentials and metal depletion. However, it has higher global warming potential, ME, TA and PMF. At the UK level, treating 4.9 Mt of kerbside FW collected annually could provide 0.37% of the national electricity demand and save 190,000 t CO2-eq./yr compared to the grid electricity. The digestate produced could displace 1% of industrial nitrogen fertilisers. Although small fractions of the national demands, they represent a valuable return from a largely unutilised waste stream and help towards implementation of a circular economy.","[Slorach, Peter C.; Jeswani, Harish K.; Cuellar-Franca, Rosa; Azapagic, Adisa] Univ Manchester, Sch Chem Engn & Analyt Sci, Sustainable Ind Syst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Cuéllar-Franca, R (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Chem Engn & Analyt Sci, Sustainable Ind Syst, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",rosa.cuellarfranca@manchester.ac.uk,"Slorach, Peter/AAQ-1576-2021; Jorge, Crisaldo/GNP-4575-2022","Slorach, Peter/0000-0002-8420-9690",UK Research Councils [EP/K011820/1],UK Research Councils,"This work was carried out as part of the UK Centre for Sustainable Energy Use in Food Chains (CSEF), funded by the UK Research Councils (EP/K011820/1).

However, the negative aspects of these processes are emissions of greenhouse gases and odorous molecules and final product potentially containing toxic compounds. These negative aspects can be limited through the addition of organic, inorganic or biological additives to the composted or vermicomposted mixture. The aims of this review are (1) to present the main characteristics of composting and vermicomposting processes with and without additives, (2) to show the influence of additives on greenhouse gas emissions during waste degradation and (3) to report the effects of additives on the properties of the final products (heavy metal and nutrient contents), in view of their use as a soil conditioner or potting media. Finally, the feasibility and potential environmental benefits of co-composting and co-vermicomposting are discussed. Our results show that additives affect composting parameters such as temperature, pH and moisture and thus have an impact on the composting process. They may be used to reduce gas emissions and mobility of mineral ions. The various additives have contrasting effects on the quality of the final product and its impact on soil quality. The use of worms and additives seems to increase plant available nutrient contents, while decreasing N leaching, heavy metal mobility and composting time. Co-composting and co-vermicomposting strategies need to be locally optimised, involving the generated amendments in a circular economy to improve sustainability of agricultural systems.","[Barthod, Justine; Rumpel, Cornelia] UPMC, UMR CNRS, INRA, iEES Paris, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Dignac, Marie-France] Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, Ecosys UMR INRA, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Cite; Universite Paris Saclay; AgroParisTech; INRAE,"Dignac, MF (corresponding author), Univ Paris Saclay, AgroParisTech, Ecosys UMR INRA, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",marie-france.dignac@inra.fr,"Dignac, Marie-France/GXH-9712-2022; Dignac, Marie-France/N-8874-2013; Rumpel, Cornelia/A-2001-2015","Dignac, Marie-France/0000-0002-0231-5597; Rumpel, Cornelia/0000-0003-2131-9451",CNRS; ADEME,CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); ADEME,Financial support was provided by the CNRS under the framework EC2CO program (LOMBRICOM project) and by the ADEME under the framework of the DOSTE program (VERMISOL project).,,204,137,145,33,303,SPRINGER FRANCE,PARIS,"22 RUE DE PALESTRO, PARIS, 75002, FRANCE",1774-0746,1773-0155,,AGRON SUSTAIN DEV,Agron.

An updated review of global food loss and waste (FLW) is presented, as well as the related environmental, social and economic impacts, based on existing data and peer-reviewed literature. The authors reflect on the different food waste patterns and challenges faced by diverse regions around the world. The scale of FLW throughout the food value chain is analyzed, from agricultural production down to household consumption and disposal. FLW represent a waste of resources used in each production stage, such as land, water and energy; FLW also contributes to unnecessary increase of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The environmental and socio-economic impacts of FLW are analyzed based on reviewed life cycle assessments. Providing insights into key concepts around FLW, this article highlights the scale of the problem at a global and regional level. It also reflects on the main challenges for implementing strategies to reduce FLW and the implications for policy-making.","[Virginia Vilarino, Maria] Argentinean Business Council Sustainable Dev, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Franco, Carol] Virginia Tech Univ, Forest Resources & Environm Conservat, Blacksburg, VA USA; [Quarrington, Caitlin] MindFuel Sci Alberta Fdn, Calgary, AB, Canada",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Vilariño, MV (corresponding author), Argentinean Business Council Sustainable Dev, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",mvilarino@ceads.org.ar,,,,,,,35,137,139,4,50,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-665X,,FRONT ENV SCI-SWITZ,Front.

The quantification of the scale and significance of IS benefits is valuable for IS promotion, while there is much few attention to it, especially in China. Under this circumstance, this paper evaluates and compares the number, scale and the related environmental/economic gains of IS activities in iron/steel-centered industrial areas in Liuzhou and Jinan in China, and Kawasaki in Japan. Results show that: in Liuzhou, there are three symbiosis activities between industries. The annual by-product/waste exchange is more than 2 million ton/y, gaining economic revenue more than 36.55 million USD for the iron/steel company. In Jinan, seven symbiotic links are between industries, and two are between urban community and iron/steel plant. The total by-product/waste exchange is over 8 million ton/y and the economic gains account to 158 million USD. In Kawasaki, iron/steel industry relates to four symbiotic links, the total by-product/waste exchange amount is about 500 kton/y, with the economic gains over 54 million USD. The form and the complexity of the IS network are different in the three cases. IS in Liuzhou and Jinan are with the features of large number and scale, but single types. While in Kawasaki, IS includes not only traditional exchanges between iron/steel plant and the other industries, but also the innovative utilization of urban refuse by industrial area. Finally, from the perspective of technology, legislative framework and support policy, circular technology inventory, integrated waste management system, information platform and national subsidies are needed to support the ever-improvement of IS promotion in China's iron/steel industry.

By formulating clear and ambitious societal goals, policy makers are aiming to steer the directionality and adoption of innovation. In the absence of suitable frameworks to understand and enhance the impact of missions, we introduce the notion of Mission-oriented Innovation Systems (MIS). MIS consists of networks of agents and sets of institutions that contribute to the development and diffusion of innovative solutions with the aim to define, pursue and complete a societal mission.

However, so far, most firms are unable to translate the concept of circular economy into their corporate strategies, business models, and operations. Some scholars have argued that firms need to develop new (and dynamic) capabilities for circular economy implementation. Yet there is a little discussion on how firms can develop such capabilities. Notably, there is a paucity of research on specific skills, processes, and organizational activities (microfoundations of dynamic capabilities) that may facilitate circular economy implementation. To address this knowledge gap, using a multiple-case studies approach, we explore microfoundations of dynamic capabilities in successful circular economy business cases. Our findings indicate that dynamic capabilities positively contribute to circular economy implementation. Our case studies show that case firms identified circular economy opportunities by using four microfoundations of sensing capability. Further, case firms acted on the identified opportunities by using simultaneously three microfoundations of seizing capability and four microfoundations of reconfiguring capability. This paper contributes to the literature on the relations between dynamic capabilities and corporate sustainability by providing insights on how sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring dynamic capabilities act in successful operationalization of circular economy strategies.","[Khan, Owais; Daddi, Tiberio; Iraldo, Fabio] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Management, I-56127 Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Khan, O (corresponding author), Scuola Super Sant Anna, Inst Management, I-56127 Pisa, Italy.",o.khan@santannapisa.it,,"DADDI, TIBERIO/0000-0002-9716-3388; Khan, Owais Ur Rehman/0000-0002-9260-210X",,,,,59,136,144,33,238,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0964-4733,1099-0836,,BUS STRATEG ENVIRON,Bus.

Biochar (BC) is an extremely versatile material, which could be produced by carbonization of organic materials, including biomass and wastes, consistently with Circular Economy principles, and tailor-made for specific applications. The potential BC role as additive in the control of the many wellknown critical issues of AD processes has been increasingly explored over the past few years. However, a clear and comprehensive understanding of the connections between BC and AD is still missing. This review paper analyses and discusses significant references (review articles, research papers and international databases and reports), mostly published in the last 10 years. This review is aimed at addressing three key issues related to the better understanding of the BC role in AD processes: 1. Investigation of the influence of BC properties on AD performances and of their ability to counteract its main challenges; 2. Assessment of the optimal BC production chain (i.e. feedstock-pyrolysis-activation) to achieve the desired features; 3. Evaluation of the economic and environmental advantages connected to BC use in AD processes, compared to conventional solutions applied to address AD challenges.","[Chiappero, Marco; Demichelis, Francesca; Fiore, Silvia] Politecn Torino, DIATI Dept Engn Environm Land & Infrastruct, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy; [Norouzi, Omid; Di Maria, Francesco] Univ Perugia, Dept Engn, LAR Lab, Perugia, Italy; [Hu, Mingyu; Masek, Ondrej] Univ Edinburgh, UK Biochar Res Ctr, Sch Geosci, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Berruti, Franco] Western Univ, Inst Chem & Fuels Alternat Resources ICFAR, Chem & Biochem Engn Dept, London, ON, Canada",Polytechnic University of Turin; University of Perugia; University of Edinburgh; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Fiore, S (corresponding author), Politecn Torino, DIATI, Corso Duca Abruzzi 24, I-10129 Turin, Italy.",silvia.fiore@polito.it,"Mašek, Ondřej/D-6315-2018; Norouzi, Omid/AAJ-6286-2021","Mašek, Ondřej/0000-0003-0713-766X; Norouzi, Omid/0000-0002-4925-4664; Berruti, Franco/0000-0001-7860-964X; Demichelis, Francesca/0000-0003-1435-868X",,,,,259,135,144,27,239,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

Developed economies are continuously innovating to promote growth and giving governmental support to the producers to move from linear economies to circular ones. Hence, waste materials in industrial systems are recycled or re-used, improving the efficiency of using finite resources with the no-waste approach. The aim of this paper is the following: (1) to identify the main components of a circular economy, which are also supportive of sustainability and development; (2) to check the impact of these variables in the economic growth of European Union countries; (3) to find out if the three components of sustainable development adopted to circular economy (CE) indicators (environmental-social-economic) are significant to economic growth. We used a fixed effect panel data analysis to identify the circular economy's impact on the economic growth of European countries. Additionally, to support the results of the regression analysis, we employed a second method-generalized methods of moments-computing the Arellano-Bond dynamic panel data estimation method. The model included five independent variables, such as environmental tax rate, a recycling rate of waste, private investment and jobs in a circular economy, patents related to recycling, and trade of recyclable raw materials. The identification of each variable was made based on a deep search through literature. The results of both econometric models showed a strong and positive correlation between a circular economy to economic growth, highlighting the crucial role of sustainability, innovation, and investment in no-waste initiatives to promote wealth.","[Hysa, Eglantina; Rehman, Naqeeb Ur] Epoka Univ, Dept Econ, Tirana 1032, Albania; [Kruja, Alba] Epoka Univ, Dept Business Adm, Tirana 1032, Albania; [Laurenti, Rafael] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Machine Design, Brinellvagen 83, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Institute of Technology,"Laurenti, R (corresponding author), KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Machine Design, Brinellvagen 83, S-11428 Stockholm, Sweden.",ehysa@epoka.edu.al; akruja@epoka.edu.al; nrehman@epoka.edu.al; rafa@kth.se,"REHMAN, NAQEEB UR/ACI-9854-2022; Hysa, Eglantina/T-7876-2018; Laurenti, Rafael/P-4171-2017; Kruja, Alba/Q-5829-2018; García, Francisco/AAJ-5004-2021","REHMAN, NAQEEB UR/0000-0003-1015-2588; Hysa, Eglantina/0000-0002-3429-5738; Laurenti, Rafael/0000-0002-7717-600X; Kruja, Alba/0000-0002-6902-1489;",CE@KTHinitiative,CE@KTHinitiative,R.L. acknowledges the financial support from the CE@KTHinitiative.,,54,135,136,10,82,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2020,12,12,,,,,,,4831,10.3390/su12124831,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12124831,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MT0IH,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000554653900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

A new generation of bioplastic from urban waste is now technically feasible. This paper is among the first to assume the perspective of the consumers rather than the manufacturers in addressing what could lead to the market acceptance of this particular type of bioplastic. A conceptual model is developed addressing psychological drivers that could encourage consumers' transition from a linear to a circular economy, with the purpose of better understanding what drives consumers' intentions to switch to and purchase products obtained from organic waste. Specifically, we find that green self-identity positively impacts perceived value, leading to higher behavioral intention. In addition, the relationship is moderated by self-congruity but not by differences in product involvement.","[Confente, Ilenia; Russo, Ivan] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Verona, Italy; [Scarpi, Daniele] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Bologna, Italy",University of Verona; University of Bologna,"Confente, I (corresponding author), Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Verona, Italy.",ilenia.confente@univr.it; daniele.scarpi@unibo.it; ivan.russo@univr.it,"Russo, Ivan/K-5907-2019; Russo, Ivan/AAG-8111-2019; Confente, Ilenia/IYS-9984-2023; SCARPI, DANIELE/A-1486-2016","Russo, Ivan/0000-0003-2697-4244; Russo, Ivan/0000-0003-2697-4244; Confente, Ilenia/0000-0003-2970-0206; SCARPI, DANIELE/0000-0001-9652-9109","European Commission via the Horizon 2020 Programme under project REsources from URban BIo-waSte (Res Urbis) [H2020-EU.3.2.4.3, H2020-EU.3.2.4.1, 730349]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [730349] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme",European Commission via the Horizon 2020 Programme under project REsources from URban BIo-waSte (Res Urbis); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme),"The research reported in this manuscript is funded by the European Commission via the Horizon 2020 Programme (H2020-EU.3.2.4.3., H2020-EU.3.2.4.1) under project REsources from URban BIo-waSte (Res Urbis) n. 730349.",,91,135,138,53,250,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0148-2963,1873-7978,,J BUS RES,J.

The Waste Framework Directive only measures the waste operations recycling, incineration, and landfill individually, not measuring the implementation of the waste hierarchy principle in Member States of the European Union. The present study proposes a waste hierarchy index (WHI) to measure the waste hierarchy within a circular economy context, applied to municipal solid waste. In developing the WHI, recycling and preparing for reuse, as defined by Eurostat, were considered as positive contributors to the circular economy, and incineration and landfill as negative contributors. The WHI was applied at different geographic scales (local and national levels) to verify its potential and limitations. The WHI is a direct and concise indicator that provides a holistic perspective on how waste is being managed. The WHI is more than a source of waste statistics; it is the beginning of a real discussion about how waste statistics should be managed to reach a circular economy through the implementation of waste hierarchy.

Food waste is the biggest challenge in global food security, wherein approximately 20-30% of food waste occurs in the post-harvest stage of the food supply chain (FSC) in developing countries. This food waste generates significant negative environmental effects in addition to the unnecessary usage (and wastage) of resources consumed in producing the wasted food. Whilst India is the major producer and exporter of many agricultural crops, there is a lack of research that evaluates the environmental impact of the Indian FSCs. The environmental impact of the same product varies according to the resources consumed and so it is important that the environmental impact of individual supply chains be considered. Also, there is a lack of studies that uses the result of environmental impact assessment to identify the operational and resource inefficiencies in FSC and develop a framework for sustainable FSC. Thus, this study aims to identify operational and resource inefficiencies present in FSC through environmental impact assessment and propose a framework for redesigning the FSC to improve environmental sustainability. Life cycle assessment approach is used for assessing the environmental impact. This framework has been applied to a mango food supply chain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Under such circumstance, circular economy should be adopted as a national development strategy. However, due to a lack of understanding current barriers on implementing circular economy, it is necessary to conduct a questionnaire based survey. The data and information used in this paper were collected by distributing questionnaires in 6 cities and interviewing 252 respondents. Our research findings indicated that while most of officials working at municipal and county levels have higher awareness and understanding on circular economy concept and its significance, nearly 16.70% of the interviewed officials had just heard of circular economy indicating that there is still a need for government officials to further improve their circular economy awareness. Government officials can receive their circular economy knowledge through awareness raising activities thus obtaining higher circular economy awareness. The main barriers on circular economy development are weakness of public awareness and lack of financial support, the prior method on pushing circular economy development is to execute compulsory regulations, which is shared by about 61.11% of all respondents; the gap between policy-making and practical action is still a serious problem.

It converts plastic waste into a secondary material that can be fed back into the system, for use in the same or new components and products, with similar or lower functionality; hence closing the loop. Up until today, research on examining the environmental impacts, economic implications and technicalities of plastic waste recycling deals with one particular aspect, or stage on the plastic value chain, lacking coherence and structure. To move this research forward, understanding the challenges and trade-offs in scaling up plastic waste recycling is necessary. Here, we bring together existing literature on the multi-faceted aspects of closing the plastic loop, critically debating on the multi-stakeholder endeavours of promoting circularity in the plastics value chain. We present an overview of how the design, production, collection and sorting of PCPW present challenges for plastic waste recycling, which in turn result to a number of trade-offs. We explain that the evaluation of the multi-dimensional implications of trade-offs arising from the PCPW recycling, is essential in measuring the long-term sustainability of resource recovery from waste systems. This work scrutinises the sustainability of closing the plastic waste loops and sets a future research agenda.","[Hahladakis, John N.] Qatar Univ, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Coll Arts & Sci, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar; [Iacovidou, Eleni] Brunel Univ London, Inst Environm Hlth & Soc, Coll Hlth & Life Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",Qatar University; Brunel University,"Hahladakis, JN (corresponding author), Qatar Univ, Ctr Sustainable Dev, Coll Arts & Sci, POB 2713, Doha, Qatar.;Iacovidou, E (corresponding author), Brunel Univ London, Inst Environm Hlth & Soc, Coll Hlth & Life Sci, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",john_chach@yahoo.gr; eleni.iacovidou@brunel.ac.uk,"IACOVIDOU, ELENI/AAP-4288-2021; Hahladakis, John N./H-3817-2019","IACOVIDOU, ELENI/0000-0001-6841-0995; Hahladakis, John N./0000-0002-8776-6345",,,,,105,133,136,10,166,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0304-3894,1873-3336,,J HAZARD MATER,J.

Our current linear socioeconomic system, characterized by the product discard at the end of product life, is one of the main causes of this natural depletion. Some governs and institution, as European Union [3] and The Ellen MacArthur Foundation [1], are calling for a new economic model, as can be seen on the Europe 2020 strategy [4]: the Europe Union has no choice but to go for the transition to a resource-efficient and ultimately regenerative circular economy. This highlights the trend for a circular economy, characterized by restoration and circularity of product components. It is a response to the inefficient management of the resources in the traditional linear model. To support this transition from a linear to a circular economy, business managers rely on new business models be developed. Product-Service System (PSS) is considered a business model that integrates products and services with the aim of fulfilling customer's needs. The objective of this study is to identify if PSS can be used as a business model for firms achieve resource-efficiency through circular economy.

In this respect, the coupling of anaerobic digestion with pyrolysis was the focus of this work. Solid-digestate obtained from anaerobic digestion was addressed to supply pyrolysis thus increasing the net energy gains and obtaining biochar (called pyrochar in our case) to be used as soil amendment alternatively to solid-digestate. The current interest on biochar is linked to its long-term soil carbon sequestration, thus contributing to global warming mitigation. A parallel detailed screening of the physical and chemical properties of both solid-digestate and pyrochar was performed, inferring their effects on soil quality. Results showed that while P and K are enriched in pyrochar, total N showed no significant differences. Heavy metals revealed higher concentrations in pyrochar, but always largely below the biochar quality thresholds. Pyrochar exhibited a higher surface area (49-88 m(2) g(-1)), a greater water holding capacity (352-366%), and a more recalcitrant carbon structure. Both solid-digestate and pyrochar showed good soil amendments properties but with complementary effects. Although starting from the same biomass, being the original feedstock processed differently, their ability to improve the physical and chemical soil properties has proved to be different. While several other soil improvers of organic origin can substitute digestate, the important role played by biochar appears not-replaceable considering its precious carbon negative action.

Developing ecologically conscious industrial park management requires analysis of both industrial and ecological systems. Traditional evaluation methods based on neoclassical economics and embodied energy and exergy analyses have certain limitations due to their focus with environmental issues considered secondary to the maximization of economic and technical objectives. Such methods focus primarily on the environmental impact of emissions and their economic consequences. These approaches ignore the contribution of ecological products and services as well as the load placed on environmental systems and related problems of carrying capacity of economic and industrial development. This paper presents a new method, based upon emergy analysis and synthesis. Such a method links economic and ecological systems together, highlighting the internal relations among the different subsystems and components. The emergy-based method provides insight into the environmental performance and sustainability of an industrial park. This paper depicts the methodology of emergy analysis at the industrial park level and provides a series of emergy-based indices. A case study is investigated and discussed in order to show the emergy method's practical potential. Results from DEDZ (Dalian Economic Development Zone) case show us the potential of emergy synthesis method at the industrial park level for environmental policy making. Its advantages and limitations are also discussed with avenues for future research identified. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This context creates a need to critically examine the research and practice in this domain to determine the gaps and propose solutions. To achieve that, we applied a two-tier analysis constituting bibliometric and content analyses for developing the intellectual structure of sustainable manufacturing (SM) literature. The study also produced a comprehensive framework to provide a granular understanding of SM literature. The framework demonstrates different paradigms of SM literature as well as the conceptual and methodological advancement of the research frontiers in the domain. The outcomes of the research comprise implications for researchers, managers, and policymakers. The study concludes that most empirical work focuses on the relationship of lean and green practices with organizational and environmental performance, but the role and criticality of sustainability are significantly underrepresented in SM literature. Based on our findings, we call for the integration of sustainability principles, that is, sustainable development goals (SDGs), circular economy, life cycle engineering, and corporate sustainability assessment with SM research.

Currently, a range of frameworks exists that propose a vision for how to operate in a CE, by identifying and organising relevant circular strategies. However, these frameworks have a limited applicability for specific business types, in particular manufacturing, and are unsuitable for use in CE oriented innovation, due to a lacking ability to support innovation processes through: 1) creating a comprehensive understanding of circular strategies, 2) mapping strategies currently applied and 3) finding opportunities for improved circularity across a range of business processes. This paper addresses these shortcomings by proposing a circular strategies framework for the manufacturing context, titled the Circular Strategies Scanner, which provides a comprehensive set of definitions of circular strategies and directly supports the early stages of CE oriented innovation. With this, the paper contributes to the body of work that develops CE transition methodology. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Extant literature has offered insights into circular strategies, smart products and product service systems (PSS) in isolated ways or by considering partial overlaps, but lacks a holistic account of their interplay. By means of an integrated review, this paper synthesises literatures from various domains to describe interrelationships among these three concepts and propose a conceptual framework of smart-circular systems. This paper thereby advances research by providing a description of three binary interrelationships: smart circularity, smart PSS and circular PSS. Moreover, the review elaborates a new understanding of smart-circular (product-service) systems by articulating the base strategy smart use and extending the following circular strategies (or technical loops): maintenance, reuse, remanufacturing and recycling. Finally, the review outlines a critique of the state of the literature on this phenomenon and offers suggestions to guide future empirical and theoretical research in the domains of circular strategies, services and business models.

This strategic role is especially evident for electric vehicle technology with a critical dependence on lithium-ion battery technology. China is the world's largest lithium consumer due to its rapid economic development, large population, and soaring consumer demand for electric vehicles driven by stricter air quality control regulations. Given this background, this study introduces the first lithium material flow analysis (MFA) for China. This MFA will inform national lithium management plans. The MFA results indicate that China's consumption was 86.7 kt of lithium carbonate equivalent in 2015, accounting for 50% of the global total. China's lithium resource is highly dependent on imports, 70% of spodumene concentrate is imported from Australia alone. Along the material life cycle (value) chain, lithium outflows were primarily from exports of lithium chemicals and lithium-embodied products. Remaining lithium in-use stocks are embodied in electric vehicles, consumer electronics, lubricating greases, and glasses/ceramics. Electric vehicle sales growth projections will likely increase China's dependence on lithium imports, lead to potential lithium supply security concerns for China. Large amount of lithium stock embodied in electric vehicles and other lithium-ion battery-containing products implies more opportunities for lithium recycling in a circular economy context.","[Hao, Han; Liu, Zongwei; Zhao, Fuquan] Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Automot Safety & Energy, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Geng, Yong] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Sarkis, Joseph] Worcester Polytech Inst, Worcester, MA 01609 USA",Tsinghua University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Worcester Polytechnic Institute,"Zhao, FQ (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Automot Safety & Energy, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Geng, Y (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China.",zhaofuquan@tsinghua.edu.cn; ygeng@sjtu.edu.cn,"Sarkis, Joseph/F-4508-2014; Geng, Yong/B-6310-2018; Hao, Han/M-8363-2019","Sarkis, Joseph/0000-0003-0143-804X; Geng, Yong/0000-0002-2284-1375; Hao, Han/0000-0001-7542-4746","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71403142, 71690241, 71461137008, 71325006, 71311140172]; State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy [ZZ2016-024]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy,"This study is sponsored by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71403142, 71690241, 71461137008, 71325006, 71311140172), State Key Laboratory of Automotive Safety and Energy (ZZ2016-024).

This embraced the accountability for reverse logistics of the end-of-life products, which is seen as a costly and complex effort to be managed. This article develops a taxonomy for critical success factors (CSFs) of the reverse logistics capable of creating value for the company and its supply chain, from the perspective of the CE technical cycle, and provides a framework that represents the relationship between the CSFs and reverse logistics in the context of the circular supply chain. The methodology adopted was the tertiary literature review using content analysis with a sample of 66 reviews. The proposed taxonomy embraced five CSFs: Material Planning and Management, Life Cycle Assessment, Industrial Sustainability, Information and Communication Technology, and Promoters and Relationships. The framework illustrates how each component of the circular supply chain (i.e. Circular Inputs, Product Design, Process Design and Circular Flows) is influenced by the five CSFs of the reverse logistics obtained, highlighting the Promoters and Relationships CSF, since it influences all components of the circular supply chain and, consequently, reverse logistics.","[Julianelli, Vivianne; Gusmao Caiado, Rodrigo Goyannes; Scavarda, Luiz Felipe] Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ind Engn, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente 225, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; [Cruz, Stephanie Pinto de Mesquita Ferreira] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 400 Bizzell St, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Gusmao Caiado, Rodrigo Goyannes] Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Tecgraf Inst, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente 225, BR-22451900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Caiado, RGG (corresponding author), Pontifical Catholic Univ Rio de Janeiro, Dept Ind Engn, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente 225, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.;Caiado, RGG (corresponding author), Pontificia Univ Catolica Rio de Janeiro, Tecgraf Inst, Rua Marques de Sao Vicente 225, BR-22451900 Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.",vjtportugal@gmail.com; rodrigocaiado@tecgraf.puc-rio.br; lf.scavarda@puc-rio.br,"Caiado, Rodrigo/S-9342-2019; Roris Rodriguez Scavarda do Carmo, Luiz Felipe/M-2317-2018","Caiado, Rodrigo/0000-0002-3290-8385; Roris Rodriguez Scavarda do Carmo, Luiz Felipe/0000-0002-8756-919X","Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) [311757/2018-9, 300007/2019-1]",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"This study was financed in part supported by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) Finance Code 001 and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), Grant Numbers 311757/2018-9 & 300007/2019-1 (EMBRAPII/IEL).",,86,131,135,19,97,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

Green technologies are still developing to provide sustainable solutions to the problems that modern cities and peri-urban areas face at an ever-increasing rate and intensity. Constructed wetlands technology is an established green multi-purpose option for water management and wastewater treatment, with numerous effectively proven applications around the world and multiple environmental and economic advantages. These systems can function as water treatment plants, habitat creation sites, urban wildlife refuges, recreational or educational facilities, landscape engineering and ecological art areas. The aim of this article is to highlight the synergies between this green technology and urban areas in order to reconnect cities with nature, to promote circularity in the urban context and to apply innovative wetland designs as landscape infrastructure and water treatment solutions. This approach could be a step further in the effort to mitigate the current degradation process of the urban landscape. Following the concept of green infrastructure, the article presents and suggests ways to integrate wetland technology in the urban environment, namely: (i) stormwater and urban runoff management (storage and treatment of water during storm events) to provide protection from flood incidents, especially considering climate change, (ii) innovative low-impact infrastructure and design solutions for urban wastewater treatment, and (iii) wetland technology for habitat creation and ecosystem services provision.","[Stefanakis, Alexandros, I] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, GR-73100 Khania, Greece",Technical University of Crete,"Stefanakis, AI (corresponding author), Tech Univ Crete, Sch Environm Engn, GR-73100 Khania, Greece.",stefanakis.alexandros@gmail.com,"Stefanakis, Alexandros I./H-6523-2019; Ara, Sharmin/GQP-2679-2022","Stefanakis, Alexandros I./0000-0001-8124-1428;",,,,,88,131,136,21,144,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC 2,2019,11,24,,,,,,,6981,10.3390/su11246981,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11246981,,,19,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KC0SU,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000506899000094,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite technological advancements, increasing length of global supply chains for products has led to a simultaneous increase in the use of packaging layers and associated waste along the supply chain. Thus, packaging poses challenges and opportunities to the environment and society, with implications for supply chain costs. With growing popularity of concepts such as circular economy and sustainability, packaging and its relationship with sustainability and supply chain management in a circular economy needs to be studied. This paper presents a systematic literature review of studies done over the last 18 years with the objective to generate a greater understanding of the work done in the field of sustainable packaging in supply chain management (SPSCM). Our findings indicate SPSCM trends are aligned to circular economy concepts but have not adequately considered the interaction of the product with its packaging system. Research efforts in SPSCM are restricted to environmental and economic dimensions and are mostly concentrated in developed economies. The review identifies three main supply chain structures studied in SPSCM literature of which there has been an increased focus on fragmented portions and dyads of the supply chain with respect to packaging. The research contributes by identifying and mapping the collated literature to organizational theories that support and drive SPSCM. In particular, the institutional theory, stakeholder theory and ecological modernization theory are investigated from a SPSCM perspective. Further, the three organizational theories are used to develop a framework for circular economy to highlight future avenues for research and practice in SPSCM for a circular economy.

The organizational responses are quite heterogeneous even when the firms face similar pressure. The authors have tried to explain this heterogeneity by using innovative capability as mediating variables. Design/methodology/approach Empirical survey data from Indian manufacturing firms are obtained to test the proposed hypotheses. The hypotheses are grounded in resource-based view of the firm. The authors used structural equation modeling approach with maximum likelihood methods of approximation. Findings The results indicate that exploratory innovation positively influences the firms to adopt CE practices. Whereas, exploitative innovation capability inhibits the adoption of CE practices. Practical implications - This study guides business managers to focus on develop exploratory innovative capabilities before the adoption of CE practices.

Global warming has been mentioned has a key challenge to be addressed due to its expected grave consequences. Air pollution is another important problem and has been responsible for many health problems causing social and economic negative effects. However the use of fossil fuels has another strategic dimension when a sustainability perspective is considered, namely the preservation of natural resources, which is a goal of Circular Economy strategy. In this work fossil fuel energy consumption is analyzed in European countries as well as its relationship with other variables such as energy dependence and share of renewable energy in gross fmal energy consumption.

As a result, ecological impacts become highlight in the national circular economy practices. To apply the eco-industrial development strategy to address the intertwined industrial and regional economic development, as well as related environmental and ecological challenges is key point. Urban industrial symbiosis provides a novel approach to realize the above expectation. Traditional evaluation on circular economy provided critical environmental insights, while to date, ecological evaluation has been rather few for urban industrial symbiosis promotion. With this circumstance, this paper developed an integrated material flows analysis (MFA) and emergy evaluation model to investigate the environmental and ecological benefits of urban industrial symbiosis implementation in one typical industrial city in China. Local oriented urban industrial symbiosis network was analyzed. Inter flows and related environmental benefits of symbiotic network were quantified with MFA, and further ecological impacts were evaluated with emergy approach and the designed emergy index. From the environmental perspective, results highlighted, in general, urban industrial symbiosis generated significant life cycle environmental benefits, especially the reduction of upstream resource mining and downstream waste disposal within the regional metabolism. In total, around 204.7 million tons ore mining, 6.9 million ton solid waste and 2.3 million tons CO2 emissions were reduced per year. From the ecological perspective, total emergy input was reduced by 1.3 x 10(22) sej, which reflected the reduction of ecological burden. Particularly, as a key indicator for ecological lost caused by pollution, dilution emergy was decreased by 2.5 x 10(16) sej, resulting from carbon mitigation co-benefit of urban industrial symbiosis. This paper provided modeling approach to understand the ecological benefits and trade-offs of circular economy practices, and critical insights on regional eco-industrial development. It will shed a light on ecological civilization construction in China in the new national planning period. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Those Strategies aim to increase quality of life and change the way that citizens react in the great debates. Those Strategies should reduce the impact of several processes on the environment through product, processes, and corporate policies using green applicable sustainable resources and environmental management systems (such as ISO 14001, EMAS) as well as a number of activities (prevention, reduced, reused etc) measuring at the same time the impact on society. This paper provides a holistic approach processing how to develop, implement, monitor and improve a strategy (even an existing one) in the framework of waste management at a local level and or at a central level. The proposed methodology could be a useful tool for any policy makers, consultants, engineers, urban planners, academics etc., in order to develop and apply strategy related with household and/or food waste prevention, material reuse, waste reduce (i.e plastics, food, recyclables etc)., in the framework of household solid waste management and beyond. Moreover, the adoption of Strategy(ies) also aims to protect and enhance the Union's natural capital and to turn the Union into a resource-efficient, green, and competitive low-carbon economy in the nearest future taking into acount also the European Green Deal stategy.

To measure the innovations brought by Circular Economy, there is a recent need to develop circularity indicators, mainly for micro level (companies and products). Furthermore, the complexity of Circular Economy implies in a set of multi-dimensional indicators instead of a single one. This paper aims to develop a set of indicators linking Circular Economy principles, Circular Business Model and the pillars of Sustainability. The set of indicators was developed based in the hypothetic-deductive approach, following a number of iterations (cycles) and testing the theory in the empirical world. A mix of research methods (e.g. expert consulting, user's feedback, and case studies) was applied. The proposed indicators should be able to achieve the principles of the Circular Economy, and, at the same time, help to meet the specificities and needs of each circular business model. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a group of indicators, focused in the three dimensions of Sustainability (environmental (from material perspective), economic and social), applied in Circular Business Models to capture the innovations brought by Circular Economy that conventional indicators do not measure. Moreover, they will help any company to identify areas with high importance and potential for improvement, and thus increase Circular Economy performance in an efficient, clear and prompt manner. These indicators were applied in three Brazilian companies which have three different Circular Business Models. The results show that data from economic and social dimensions was not available or was diffused in the companies. It represents a barrier because most of the positive impacts gained with Circular Economy are presented in the social dimension, including job creation, mindset change, etc. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the willingness of many educational institutions worldwide to embrace the SDGs, given escalating sustainability challenges, this article questions whether ESDG is desirable as an education for the future. Many challenges outlined by the SDGs are supposed to be solved by inclusive or sustainable economic growth, assuming that economic growth can be conveniently decoupled from resource consumption. Yet, the current hegemony of the sustainability-through-growth paradigm has actually increased inequalities and pressure on natural resources, exacerbating biodiversity loss, climate change and resulting social tensions. With unreflective support for growth, far from challenging the status quo, the SDGs and consequently, the ESDGs, condone continuing environmental exploitation, depriving millions of species of their right to flourish, and impoverishing future generations.

Findings The theoretical setting maps a set of managerial practices for a circular economy business model and sets the research gaps and questions in a research framework designed along three main dimensions: value network, customer value proposition and interface, and managerial commitment. Then, through an empirical analysis, the findings reveal that the proposed dimensions are interdependent and reinforce each other. Moreover, the managerial commitment as moderating factor between the value network and the customer value proposition and interface dimensions is identified as essential for reaching the intended goals of circular economy business models.

However, there exists great semantic confusion within academic literature surrounding the term sharing economy, which threatens the realisation of its purported sustainability potential. (2) Objective: The aim of this paper is to synthesise the existing academic definitions and propose a definition of the sharing economy from the perspective of sustainability science in order to indicate sharing practices that are consistent with the sustainability claims attributed to the sharing economy. (3) Methods: We conduct a database search to collect relevant academic articles. Then, we leverage qualitative content analysis in order to analyse the authors' definitions and to synthesise the broad dimensions of the sharing economy in the discourse. (4) Results: We propose the following characteristics, or semantic properties, of the sharing economy for sustainability: ICT-mediated, non-pecuniary motivation for ownership, temporary access, rivalrous and tangible goods. (5) Conclusion: The semantic properties that inform our definition of the sharing economy for sustainability indicate those sharing practices that promote sustainable consumption compared to purely market-based exchanges. This definition is relevant for academics studying the sustainability impacts of the sharing economy in order to promote comparability and compatibility in research. Furthermore, the definition is useful for policy-makers, entrepreneurs, managers and consumers that have the sharing economy on the agenda in order to promote social enterprise and support sustainable consumption.","[Curtis, Steven Kane; Lehner, Matthias] Lund Univ, IIIEE, Tegnersplatsen 4, S-22350 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Curtis, SK (corresponding author), Lund Univ, IIIEE, Tegnersplatsen 4, S-22350 Lund, Sweden.",steven.curtis@iiiee.lu.se; matthias.lehner@iiiee.lu.se,"Lehner, Matthias/JPL-3064-2023","Lehner, Matthias/0000-0003-1571-7453; Curtis, Steven/0000-0002-8442-5027",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme [771872]; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (The Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences) [RIK16-1055:1],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme(European Research Council (ERC)); Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (The Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences),This research has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement No. 771872) and Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (The Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences) (Grant Agreement No. RIK16-1055:1).,,143,129,134,29,270,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 1,2019,11,3,,,,,,,567,10.3390/su11030567,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11030567,,,25,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HL7NY,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000458929500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This research aims to identify and characterise different types of business models that create value from agricultural waste and by-products via cascading or closing loops. Conceptual and management insights into circular business models are still sparse. In total, 39 cases have been studied that convert agro-waste and by-products into valuable products via a circular economy approach. Semi-structured interviews and on-site visits of six representative cases have been done, and secondary data been collected. Data has been treated with content analysis. Cases are presented according to the type of organisational structure, resources, transformation processes, value propositions, key partners, customers, strategic approaches and innovation. Six types of circular business models are identified and discussed: biogas plant, upcycling entrepreneurship, environmental biorefinery, agricultural cooperative, agropark and support structure. They differ in their way of value creation and organisational form, but strongly depend on partnerships and their capacity to respond to changing external conditions. This study offers the first circular business model typology within the agricultural domain, revealing the interconnectedness of the six different business model types. It provides options for managers in positioning and adapting their business strategies. It highlights the potential of using biomass first for higher added-value products before exploiting it as energy source. Cascading biomass valorisation at a territorial level will increasingly be important for locally cooperating actors within a circular bioeconomy approach. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The purpose of this paper is to present barriers to CE adoption identified by a literature review. The paper also addresses the particular challenges faced by manufacturers by answering the research question: What are the dominant barriers faced by the manufacturing industry in moving towards a CE? Design/methodology/approach This paper presents a literature review of research identifying barriers for adopting to CE in the manufacturing sector. The literature review is followed by a case study identifying barriers to CE as seen by ten companies within manufacturing, including the GS1 global information standardisation agency used by all manufacturers. Findings The manufacturers investigated focus mostly on recycling and waste reduction. These policies have low or very low CE effect. High CE effect policies like maintenance and reuse targeting the CE ideal of no waste, are nearly non-existent. The results identified seven main barriers to the CE: (1) high start-up costs, (2) complex supply chains, (3) challenging business-to-business (B2B) cooperation, (4) lack of information on product design and production, (5) lack of technical skills, (6) quality compromise and (7) disassembly of products is time-consuming and expensive. Social implications The study has found that the major barriers for implementation of CE are quality issues in recycled materials, supply chain complexities, coordination problems between companies, design and production of the product, disassembly of products and high start-up/ investment costs. Originality/value The research shows how the transition towards a CE takes place in manufacturing industries by studying the manufacturing sector.","[Jaeger, Bjoern] Hogskolen Molde, Fac Logist, Molde, Norway; [Upadhyay, Arvind] Univ Brighton, Brighton Business Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England",Molde University College; University of Brighton,"Upadhyay, A (corresponding author), Univ Brighton, Brighton Business Sch, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",a.upadhyay@brighton.ac.uk,"Jæger, Bjørn/B-6001-2017; Upadhyay, Arvind/AAI-1737-2019","Jæger, Bjørn/0000-0002-4661-5102; Upadhyay, Arvind/0000-0002-6906-5369",,,,,42,128,128,12,142,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1741-0398,1758-7409,,J ENTERP INF MANAG,J.

Improvement actions focused on transformation towards a CE should be targeted at all groups of materials and waste. As water is essential for human survival and well-being and plays a significant role in sustainable development (SD), the actions related to the reuse of water and the recovery of raw materials from wastewater and other water-based waste should be taken. The paper presents a proposition for a new CE model framework in the water and wastewater sector, which includes the six following actions: reduction-prevent wastewater generation in the first place by the reduction of water usage and pollution reduction at source; reclamation (removal)-an application of effective technologies for the removal of pollutants from water and wastewater; reuse-reuse of wastewater as an alternative source of water supply (non-potable usage), recycling-recovery of water from wastewater for potable usage; recovery-recovery of resources such as nutrients and energy from water-based waste, and rethink-rethinking how to use resources to create a sustainable economy, which is `free` of waste and emissions. The novelty of the proposed CE model framework is that it presents possible ways of implementing CE principles in the water and wastewater sector, with a strong emphasis not only technological but also organisational and societal changes. Application of the proposed model may help to further transform the European economy to the CE model. Moreover, the indicated model can be significant tool supporting an assessment of local or regional progress towards CE in the water and wastewater sector and further environmental management and planning.","[Smol, Marzena] AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Antoniego Gramatyka 10 Str, PL-30071 Krakow, Poland; [Adam, Christian] Bundesanstalt Mat Forsch & Prufung BAM, Dept Mat & Environm 4, Unter Eichen 87, D-12205 Berlin, Germany; [Smol, Marzena; Preisner, Michal] Polish Acad Sci, Mineral & Energy Econ Res Inst, Wybickiego 7a Str, PL-31261 Krakow, Poland",AGH University of Krakow; Federal Institute for Materials Research & Testing; Polish Academy of Sciences; Mineral & Energy Economy Research Institute of the Polish Academy of Sciences,"Smol, M (corresponding author), AGH Univ Sci & Technol, Antoniego Gramatyka 10 Str, PL-30071 Krakow, Poland.;Smol, M (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Mineral & Energy Econ Res Inst, Wybickiego 7a Str, PL-31261 Krakow, Poland.",smol@meeri.pl,"Preisner, Michał/ABA-2980-2020; Adam, Christian/A-8655-2011; Preisner, Michał/AAI-9994-2021","Preisner, Michał/0000-0001-9795-4086; Adam, Christian/0000-0002-3356-4617;",project Monitoring of water and sewage management in the context of the implementation of the circular economy assumptions - Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA) within the International Academic Partnerships Programme [PPI/APM/2019/1/00015/U/00001/ZU/00002],project Monitoring of water and sewage management in the context of the implementation of the circular economy assumptions - Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA) within the International Academic Partnerships Programme,"This work was funded by the project Monitoring of water and sewage management in the context of the implementation of the circular economy assumptions, that is financed by the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange (NAWA) within the International Academic Partnerships Programme (No. PPI/APM/2019/1/00015/U/00001/ZU/00002).",,84,128,130,4,55,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1438-4957,1611-8227,,J MATER CYCLES WASTE,J.

Bans on additional types of solid waste will take effect soon. Here we discuss the possible profound effects of such policy changes on the global circular economy of solid waste. Recycling industries in developed countries will face challenges in the short run, due to their limited capacity and past reliance on exporting, but also opportunities in the long run. Furthermore, developing countries currently without stringent environmental regulations will likely become the new pollution haven of solid waste from developed countries and even emerging economies such as China itself. To truly reap the benefits from China's new policies which are originally designed for environmental sustainability and social justice, the global community needs to develop appropriate policy framework to prevent the unintended consequences.","[Qu, Shen; Guo, Yuhua; Xu, Ming] Univ Michigan, Sch Environm & Sustainabil, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Guo, Yuhua] Cent Iron & Steel Res Inst, State Key Lab Adv Steel Proc & Prod, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Zijie; Chen, Wei-Qiang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Urban Environm, Key Lab Urban Environm & Hlth, 1799 Jimei Rd, Xiamen 361021, Peoples R China; [Ma, Zijie; Chen, Wei-Qiang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jianguo] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Environm, Key Lab Solid Waste Management & Environm Safety, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Gang] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Chem Engn Biotechnol & Environm Technol, SDU Life Cycle Engn, DK-5230 Odense, Denmark; [Wang, Yutao] Fudan Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Pudan Tyndall Ctr, Shanghai 200438, Peoples R China; [Xu, Ming] Univ Michigan, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA","University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Central Iron & Steel Research Institute; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Urban Environment, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Tsinghua University; University of Southern Denmark; Fudan University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan","Xu, M (corresponding author), Cent Iron & Steel Res Inst, State Key Lab Adv Steel Proc & Prod, Beijing, Peoples R China.",mingxu@umich.edu,"Xu, Ming/IWM-0504-2023; Liu, Liu/JXM-8208-2024; Liu, Gang/J-3181-2013; Wang, Yutao/P-4878-2019; CAS, KLUEH/T-5743-2019; Chen, Wei-Qiang/HJY-2209-2023; Xu, Ming/F-3653-2010","Wang, Yutao/0000-0001-8297-8579; Chen, Wei-Qiang/0000-0002-7686-2331; Liu, Gang/0000-0002-7613-1985; Xu, Ming/0000-0002-7106-8390",,,,,16,128,132,10,201,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

However, the majority of existing studies focus on operational requirements or on material stocks. To date, very few studies have quantified embodied environmental requirements of building stocks and spatialised them. This study describes a bottom-up approach to spatially model building stocks and quantify their embodied environmental requirements. It uses a highly disaggregated approach where each building's geometry is modelled and used to derive a bill of quantities. Construction assemblies relevant to each building archetype (derived based on land-use, age and height) are defined using expert knowledge in construction. The initial and recurrent embodied energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions associated with each material within each assembly are calculated using a comprehensive hybrid analysis technique. This model is applied to all buildings of the City of Melbourne, Australia. Results show that rebuilding the City of Melbourne's building stock today would require 904 kt of materials/km(2) (total: 32 725 kt), 10 PJ/km(2) (total: 362 PJ), 17.7 Million m(3) of embodied water/km(2) (total: 640.74 Million m(3)) and would emit 605 ktCO(2)e/km(2) (total: 23 530 ktCO(2)e). This study demonstrates the breadth of the model outputs, including material stocks maps and breakdowns of life cycle embodied requirements by material, construction assembly, building and building typology at the city level.

This environmental management concept can be implemented at three levels, namely, region, industrial zone, and individual enterprise, with the objective of boosting economic development while lessening environmental and resource challenges. Environmental supply chain cooperation (ESCC), an approach that utilizes customer and supplier cooperation in environmental management, has been initiated among Chinese enterprises. Using survey data collected from 396 Chinese manufacturers, we examine the role of ESCC practices in influencing the relationship between implementing CE practices and the achievement of performance outcomes by testing the moderation and mediation effects of ESCC practices on the CE practice-performance relationship through hierarchical regression analysis. Our data analyses indicate that ESCC practices are useful by moderation and, in some cases, essential by mediation, for Chinese manufacturers seeking to realize the performance targets desired in CE practices. The results highlight the need for Chinese manufacturers to improve supply chain coordination in their implementation of CE. On the policy side, our research findings suggest that ESCC practices are beneficial and, in some cases, necessary for the development of CE in China.","[Zhu, Qinghua] Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Business Management, Inst Ecoplanning & Dev, Dalian 116024, Liaoning Prov, Peoples R China; [Geng, Yong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Appl Ecol, Shenyang, Liaoning Prov, Peoples R China; [Lai, Kee-hung] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Logist & Maritime Studies, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China","Dalian University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shenyang Institute of Applied Ecology, CAS; Hong Kong Polytechnic University","Zhu, QH (corresponding author), Dalian Univ Technol, Sch Business Management, Inst Ecoplanning & Dev, Dalian 116024, Liaoning Prov, Peoples R China.",zhuqh@dlut.edu.cn,"Zhu, Qinghua/M-3408-2016; Lai, Kee-hung/B-4054-2009; Geng, Yong/B-6310-2018","Zhu, Qinghua/0000-0003-2648-0260; Lai, Kee-hung/0000-0001-9296-0882; Geng, Yong/0000-0002-2284-1375","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars [71025002]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [70772085, 70911140101, 71033004]; Chinese Academy of Science's [2008-318]; Liaoning Science Foundation [20092078]; Shenyang Municipality Research Fund [1091147-9-00, F10-238-6-00]; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in China [GRF PolyU 5440/09H]",National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Chinese Academy of Science's(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Liaoning Science Foundation; Shenyang Municipality Research Fund; Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in China,"We are grateful for the helpful and constructive comments of the three anonymous reviewers on earlier versions of this article.

Driven by a vision of continued economic expansion and growth on a planet with finite natural resources, CBMs are endorsed by political institutions, multinational corporations, business consultancies, and academia. Some argue that CBM configurations contribute to a more holistic and radical change in the existing business logics than approaches that achieve incremental resource efficiency improvements. However, how holistic and radical are CBMs theoretically constituted in academia if we consider the deep structural and paradigmatic shifts in societies necessary to deal with the challenges associated with the Anthropocene? Prior studies do not examine the inherent normative settings and the operational change approaches beneath CBM concepts. To reconstruct the theoretical foundations of CBMs critically, the recent CBM body of academic literature is systematically reviewed according to (1) the legitimacy of CBMs (why should it be done) (2) the modes of value creation and offerings (what should be done), and (3) the core principles of CBM integration into daily business (how should it be done). From this synthesis, the predominant notion of sustainability behind the CBM concept can be revealed. This study argues contemporary scientifically constructed CBMs need to be reconsidered if they are intended to contribute to a profound economic transition toward sustainability. Hence, the paper shows how principles from more holistic, radical, and pluralistic economic approaches can widen CBMs and how future research can help to diversify the concept. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

There is a need for comprehensive long-term strategies for transforming the mining industry to move toward zero environmental footprint. How can the mining industry create new economic value, minimise its social and environmental impacts and diminish liability from mining waste? This would require cross-disciplinary skills, across the social, environmental, technical, legal, regulatory, and economic domains, to produce innovative solutions. The aim of this paper is to review the current knowledge across these domains and integrate them in a new approach for exploiting or re-thinking mining wastes. This approach includes five key areas of social dimensions, geoenvironmental aspects, geometallurgy specifications, economic drivers and legal implications for improved environmental outcomes, and circular economy aspirations, which are aligned with the 10 principles of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). Applying circular economy thinking to mining waste presents a major opportunity to reduce the liability and increase the value of waste materials arising from mining and processing operations.","[Tayebi-Khorami, Maedeh; Edraki, Mansour; Corder, Glen; Golev, Artem] Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Ctr Mined Land Rehabil, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Golev, A (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Sustainable Minerals Inst, Ctr Mined Land Rehabil, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",m.tayebikhorami@uq.edu.au; m.edraki@cmlr.uq.edu.au; g.corder@smi.uq.edu.au; a.golev@uq.edu.au,"Tayebi-Khorami, Maedeh/F-4379-2014; Edraki, Mansour/B-1647-2017","Tayebi-Khorami, Maedeh/0000-0002-7530-1559; Edraki, Mansour/0000-0002-9889-5716",,,,,63,127,132,15,56,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-163X,,MINERALS-BASEL,Minerals,MAY,2019,9,5,,,,,,,286,10.3390/min9050286,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min9050286,,,13,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,IM3OD,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000477902800060,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a future circular economy, new business models are needed that slow, close and narrow resource loops to address key resource and climate challenges. After a phase of excitement and inspiration, an operationalization phase needs to start to ensure the best possible implementation and transition towards a circular economy. This operationalization phase will involve the development of products, processes and business models that significantly lower the negative impact on the environment, reduce waste and resource pressures and, rather, create a positive impact on society and environment. This paper focuses on the circular business model lens as a comprehensive way of addressing business innovation. Within this evolving circular economy operationalization phase, several tools, approaches and methods are emerging that could support circular business model innovation. This paper seeks to create a comprehensive tools overview through a literature and practice review. It provides structure to the emerging range of tools, methods and approaches, and, based on this, a guideline for future tool development.

We make a conceptual link between lean startup thinking, triple bottom line value creation, and organizational capabilities. The case study firm uses a novel experimentation approach to pursue the goal of diverting all of its sold clothing from landfill through a two-year project. This requires substantial changes to the current business practice because in 2012, the clothing retailer recovered 1% of all garments sold. The fibre input value for all garments sold in 2012 exceeded $7m. We found that despite a stated need for fast learning through project experiments, the experiments were not executed quickly. (1) The desire to plan project activities and the lack of lean startup approach expertise across the whole project team hampered fast action. This led to the extension of the project timeline. However, project team confidence about learning by doing increased through privately executed experiments. (2) Some project experiments were not fit to meet the triple bottom value creation project goal and were dropped from the project. Overall, the corporate mindset of economic value creation still dominated. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, PPP is suffering from problems such as 'long negotiation time', 'lack of transparency', and 'uneven risk and return allocation', which in turn lead to 'ineffective delivery' and 'poor value for money'. Using a case study, this paper reports some lessons learnt from innovative practices of procuring C&D management services in Suzhou, China. It is discovered that the public and private sectors, without prior knowledge, are operating based on a general concession framework instead of negotiating a clear-cut agreement from the outset. Several key arrangements, such as price, concession period, and strategic operations, are based on relational contract-type of agreements, which are found particularly innovative for shortening the negotiation time, fostering the trust between the relevant parties, dealing with emerging ad hoc problems, and allowing sustainable development of the circular economy. To make such PPP work, it is critical to devise institutions to prevent corruption and opportunistic behaviors. This research provides useful references to developing a circular economy. Although they focus on C&D waste management, the research findings can be applied to other public procurement settings, such as municipal solid waste management service. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study plastic waste is upcycled into 3-D printing filament with a recyclebot, which is an open source waste plastic extruder. The recyclebot is combined with an open source self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer, to enable post-consumer ABS plastic filament from computer waste to be further upcycled into valuable consumer products pre-designed in the digital commons. The total electrical energy consumption for the combined process is monitored and an economic evaluation is completed. The coupled distributed recycling and manufacturing method for complex products reduces embodied energy by half, while reducing the cost of consumer products to pennies. This economic benefit provides an incentive for consumers to both home recycle and home manufacture, which tightens the loop on the circular economy by eliminating waste associated from transportation and retail. It is clear from the results that waste plastic can be significantly upcycled at the individual level using this commons-based approach. This tightening of the loop of the circular economy benefits the environment and sustainability as well as the economic stability of consumers/prosumers.","[Zhong, Shan; Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Aalto Univ, Dept Elect & Nanoengn, Sch Elect Engn, Espoo, Finland; [Pearce, Joshua M.] Michigan Technol Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Houghton, MI 49931 USA",Michigan Technological University; Aalto University; Michigan Technological University,"Pearce, JM (corresponding author), 601 M&M Bldg,1400 Townsend Dr, Houghton, MI 49931 USA.",pearce@mtu.edu,"Pearce, Joshua/D-2052-2010","Pearce, Joshua/0000-0001-9802-3056",Tech for Trade; Fulbright Finland,Tech for Trade; Fulbright Finland,This study was supported by Tech for Trade and by Fulbright Finland.,,87,126,131,1,78,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

One way to reduce this impact involves the opportunity to recycle waste materials as fiber in concrete reinforcement, thus following the circular economy principles. The feasibility of using different waste materials in Recycled Fiber Reinforced Concrete (RFRC) is attracting practitioners' attention. Through a systematic literature review, the paper analyzes the academic literature on concrete reinforcement using recycled fibers. The main goal is to provide an exhaustive analysis of the phenomenon with rigorous and reproducible research criteria. Eventually, 194 articles were analyzed. RFRC is a research topic, which is rapidly growing over the last years and scholars' attention is focused both on engineering aspects, through experimental studies testing the composite mechanical properties, and environmental sustainability considerations. From the analysis, emerged that even though the relevance of the construction industry and, as a consequence, of concrete in the global transition toward sustainability it is widely recognized, there is a gap in investing the potential of RFCR in addressing the triple bottom line of it. Finally, it emerged a great research potential in exploring how recycled fibers may be part of a construction industry oriented and inspired to circular economy principles. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Its direct environmental impacts include a large use of non-renewable energy and mineral resources while its indirect impacts are related to the disposal of construction and demolition wastes (C&DW). To improve its environmental performances the sector is innovating in terms of cleaner materials, products and processes. Cleaner production (CP) as a preventive approach to environmental issues is showing to be adequate to address the environmental impacts of the construction sector for the transition towards the sustainable construction (SC). In China CP plays an important role along with the circular economy (CE) in the national environmental legislation and policy adopted to tackle the huge environmental challenges and for the transition to the sustainable development. In our study we carry out a narrative literature review to explore the alternative C&DW management (C&DWM) strategies beyond landfilling implemented in China for the purpose of evaluating the transition towards CP. The results show that CP for C&DWM has not been yet fully implemented in construction companies and industry mainly due to legislative and economic barriers. Construction companies are also much resistant to eco-innovation due to the fact they are only profit driven and lack of awareness of environmental protection through C&DWM, as well as lack of culture towards sustainable development. A refining of the current C&DWM regulations, laws and policies as well as the support of the demand of sustainable buildings are suggested as urgent measures to improve the C&DWM by the construction companies and to put the goals of CP, CE and SC at the forefront of their business agenda. For increased sustainability the above mentioned C&DWM policies should be based on much stronger integration of economic and environmental evaluation tools, in order to overcome regulatory, know-how and business barriers to Cleaner Production within a framework of environmental stewardship that aims to preserve the environmental integrity and the ecosystem services provided to the economy and societal wellbeing.

The compositional analyses of 173 different samples of post-consumer plastic packaging from different locations in the network were combined to indicatively describe the complete network with material flow analysis, data reconciliation techniques and process technological parameters. The derived potential of post-consumer plastic packages in the Netherlands in 2014 amounted to 341 Gg net (or 20.2 kg net.cap(-1).a(-1)). The complete recycling network produced 75.2 Gg milled goods, 28.1 Gg side products and 16.7 Gg process waste. Hence the net recycling chain yield for post consumer plastic packages equalled 30%. The end-of-life fates for 35 different plastic packaging types were resolved. Additionally, the polymeric compositions of the milled goods and the recovered masses were derived with this model. These compositions were compared with experimentally determined polymeric compositions of recycled milled goods, which confirmed that the model predicts these compositions reasonably well. Also the modelled recovered masses corresponded reasonably well with those measured experimentally. The model clarified the origin of polymeric contaminants in recycled plastics, either sorting faults or packaging components, which gives directions for future improvement measures.

A dematerialization of the economy of industrialized countries can be achieved by a change in course, from an industrial economy built on throughput to a circular economy built on stock optimization, decoupling wealth and welfare from resource consumption while creating more work. The business models of a circular economy have been known since the mid-1970s and are now applied in a number of industrial sectors. This paper argues that a simple and convincing lever could accelerate the shift to a circular economy, and that this lever is the shift to a tax system based on the principles of sustainability: not taxing renewable resources including human labour-work-but taxing non-renewable resources instead is a powerful lever. Taxing materials and energies will promote low-carbon and low-resource solutions and a move towards a 'circular' regional economy as opposed to the 'linear' global economy requiring fuel-based transport for goods throughput. In addition to substantial improvements in material and energy efficiency, regional job creation and national greenhouse gas emission reductions, such a change will foster all activities based on 'caring', such as maintaining cultural heritage and natural wealth, health services, knowledge and know-how.",,,"Stahel, WR (corresponding author), 7 Chemin Vignettes, CH-1231 Conches, Switzerland.",walter_stahel@genevaassociation.org,,,,,,,40,125,132,2,98,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",1364-503X,1471-2962,,PHILOS T R SOC A,Philos.

The paper explores how firms develop localization, agility and digitization (L-A-D) capabilities by applying (or not applying) their critical circular economy (CE) and blockchain technology (BCT)-related resources and capabilities that they either already possess or acquire from external agents. Design/methodology/approach An abductive approach, applying exploratory qualitative research was conducted over a sample of 24 firms. The sample represented different industries to study their critical BCT and CE resources and capabilities and the L-A-D capabilities. Firm resources and capabilities were classified using the technology, organization and environment (TOE) framework. Findings Findings show significant patterns on adoption levels of the blockchain-enabled circular economy system (BCES) and L-A-D capability development. The greater the BCES adoption capabilities, the greater the L-A-D capabilities. Organizational size and industry both influence the relationship between BCES and L-A-D. Accordingly, research propositions and a research framework are proposed. Research limitations/implications Given the limited sample size, the generalizability of the findings is limited. Our findings extend supply chain resiliency research. A series of propositions provide opportunities for future research. The resource-based view and resource-dependency theories are useful frameworks to better understanding the relationship between firm resources and supply chain resilience. Practical implications The results and discussion of this study serve as useful guidance for practitioners to create CE and BCT resources and capabilities for improving supply chain resiliency. Social implications The study shows the socio-economic and socio-environmental importance of BCES in the COVID-19 or similar crises.

In this sense, circular economy practices can be advantageous when using bioenergy in the agro-industrial sector. Although only about 9% of the world's economy is circular, global initiatives have acted to change that scenario. Unlike the linear economy (take-make-use-dispose), the circular economy (grow-make-use-restore) aims to influence material and energy flows to increase environmental gains and avoid costs. Based on that, this study aims to map bioenergy boosters through circular economy practices in agriculture. To that end, a systematic literature review was conducted to present what is being developed in this field. To identify the most relevant, high impact, studies in the area, the systematic literature review was performed in three databases, covering all available literature up to date. The main research themes, applications, research topics, area of activity, countries, journals, publisher, and history of publication were identified. Therewith, some trends and perspectives could be drawn. To date, no solidly established authors have been identified in the area. The theme is recent and the vast majority of documents have been published over the last four years. European countries have been pioneering and are the most prominent in terms of publications. The electricity generation and biofuel produced from biogas have shown representativeness and are sustainable opportunities to advance the theme. Therefore, this study can contribute to encouraging the agricultural sector in implementing or increasing the use of circular economy practices.","[Barros, Murillo Vetroni; Salvador, Rodrigo; de Francisco, Antonio Carlos; Piekarski, Cassiano Moro] Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Sustainable Prod Syst Lab LESP, Postgrad Program Prod Engn PPGEP, Ponta Grossa, Parana, Brazil",Universidade Tecnologica Federal do Parana,"Barros, MV (corresponding author), Univ Tecnol Fed Parana UTFPR, Sustainable Prod Syst Lab LESP, Postgrad Program Prod Engn PPGEP, Ponta Grossa, Parana, Brazil.",murillo.vetroni@gmail.com; salvador.rodrigors@gmail.com; acfrancisco@utfpr.edu.br; piekarski@utfpr.edu.br,"Piekarski, Cassiano Moro/R-3936-2019; de Francisco, Antonio Carlos/G-4374-2015; Salvador, Rodrigo/X-8245-2019","Piekarski, Cassiano Moro/0000-0002-5085-101X; de Francisco, Antonio Carlos/0000-0003-0401-4445; Salvador, Rodrigo/0000-0003-3398-7684; Barros, Murillo Vetroni/0000-0002-1711-6056",Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) [001]; National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Servico Nacional de Aprendizagem do Cooperativismo (SESCOOP),Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Servico Nacional de Aprendizagem do Cooperativismo (SESCOOP),"This study was financed in part by the Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior - Brasil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001, the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), and the Servico Nacional de Aprendizagem do Cooperativismo (SESCOOP).",,133,124,129,9,109,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",1364-0321,1879-0690,,RENEW SUST ENERG REV,Renew.

There has been important progress in this area, with an increasing number of papers that cover diverse environmental aspects, including the circular economy, recycling and the life cycle assessment of materials. This increase is due to the importance that scientists, industry, government and society are now giving to these topics. This review seeks to develop a greater awareness in relation to the possibilities and implications in the use of the AM, as well as to encourage sustainable development by raising awareness in relation to the taking of necessary actions to achieve compliance of the Sustainable Development Goals. Similarly, current trends are examined in relation to the practices that are currently being adopted in order to ensure that AM is consolidated as a sustainable and convenient practice in the economic, social and environmental spheres. In general, polymers, ceramics, metals and composite materials are now undergoing intensive research to improve their use. Although this research shows that significant progress has been made on several relevant issues, using materials optimization to minimize energy and waste is still far from a global solution.

It has also been recognized as a key strategy to reduce construction-induced carbon emissions. However, there is limited research to examine carbon emission reduction in prefabrication by using the advanced technological artefacts, e.g., building information modeling (BIM), emerging from the technology sphere. As a digital representation of a facility, BIM provides a cyber platform based on which many assessment and simulation works can be performed without having to construct the physical facility. This paper aims to develop a BIM-based approach to measuring carbon emission reduction during the materialization stage of a prefabricated building project. Findings from the study indicate that BIM is an efficient and effective method for measuring carbon emissions from the construction of new buildings and that prefabrication reduces carbon emissions when compared with conventional construction methods. The research contributes to the body of knowledge relating to the reduction of carbon emissions through prefabrication. This is pertinent to contractors, homebuyers and governments who are constantly seeking ways to achieve a circular economy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, so far, there has been no agreement to measure how effective an industry/product is in making the transition from linear to circular approaches, particularly those that affect society. This research work aims to perform a systematic literature review (n = 60) to analyze and discuss how social aspects have been considered and integrated in CE research so far. Moreover, this review provides an overview of the literature on social impact within the CE, which results in three main outputs: a knowledge map of the CE, an analysis of social aspects within CE, and the theories/frameworks used to evaluate social impact of CE. Finally, this study brings to light how CE implementation can affect society and highlights the importance of social dimension in the domains of CE and a policy-making community, which could help move CE towards a sustainable development.","[Padilla-Rivera, Alejandro] Polytech Montreal, CIRAIG, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada; [Russo-Garrido, Sara; Merveille, Nicolas] Univ Quebec Montreal, Dept Strategy & Corp Social Responsibil, CIRAIG, ESG, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Polytechnique Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Padilla-Rivera, A (corresponding author), Polytech Montreal, CIRAIG, Dept Math & Ind Engn, Montreal, PQ H3T 1J4, Canada.",alejandro-de-jesus.padilla-rivera@polymtl.ca; russo_garrido.sara@uqam.ca; Merveille.nicolas@uqam.ca,"Padilla-Rivera, Alejandro/N-8152-2019; Padilla-Rivera, Alejandro/AAI-3530-2020; Merveille, Nicolas/HNQ-7949-2023","Padilla-Rivera, Alejandro/0000-0002-8290-6804; Merveille, Nicolas/0000-0002-8026-8394; Yanet, Niko/0000-0002-6758-4851",Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (Mexico) [740519]; UQAM,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (Mexico)(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); UQAM,This research was funded by Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (Mexico) grant number: 740519.

These landfills yield leachate which is a highly contaminated wastewater. Thus, a proper treatment of leachate is highly recommended before the final discharge. Recently, the use of membrane separation technology alongside bioreactors have opened a new gateway in treating refractory wastewater such as landfill leachate. Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) is a promising technique for leachate treatment due its substantial benefits over other conventional anaerobic and aerobic technologies. Thus, this study provides a comprehensive review and assessment on the potential practice of AnMBR in treating landfill leachate and its technological advancements in the recent past. A critical review on the performance of a lab-scale AnMBR on landfill leachate with the biogas production is also included in the current work. Moreover, this study inspects various factors affecting the performance of AnMBR along with its limitations and future perspectives. The simultaneous treatment of landfill leachate anaerobically to produce bioenergy complies with the principles of circular economy and sustainable growth.

This paper presents a techno-economic and profitability analysis of four food waste biorefineries that use wastes from tomato, potato, orange, and olive processing as feedstock. The study includes the assessment of potentially available quantities of those waste flows in Europe. Due to the low technology readiness level of this kind of biorefineries, a screening methodology to estimate the investment and manufacturing costs as well as two profitability ratios (the return on investment and the payback time) was adopted. Results show that not all the waste feedstocks have the same potential. The most profitable options are those related to implementing fewer plants, namely concentrating the production and capitalising on economies of scale while being at risk of increasing externalities, e.g. due to logistics of the feedstocks.","[Cristobal, Jorge; Caldeira, Carla; Corrado, Sara; Sala, Serenella] European Commiss, JRC, Directorate D Sustainable Resources, Bioecon Unit, Via E Fermi, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site,"Sala, S (corresponding author), European Commiss, JRC, Directorate D Sustainable Resources, Bioecon Unit, Via E Fermi, I-21027 Ispra, VA, Italy.",serenella.sala@ec.europa.eu,"Sala, Serenella/AAA-9133-2022","Sala, Serenella/0000-0003-1919-9948; Caldeira, Carla/0000-0001-5679-4522; Cristobal, Jorge/0000-0003-1872-4288",,,,,45,123,131,4,90,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0960-8524,1873-2976,,BIORESOURCE TECHNOL,Bioresour.

SDG 6 expands the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) focus on drinking water and basic sanitation to now cover the entire water cycle, including the management of water, wastewater and ecosystem resources. A UN report in 2017 states that likely over 80% of the wastewater worldwide is still discharged without adequate treatment. In several countries the wastewater management is nowadays a norm, but still there are open discussions about the kind of approach to be adopted, i.e. centralisation vs. decentralisation. The choice of the adopted technologies is strictly linked to environmental performances and economical aspects; one of the possible causes for the still enormous amount of untreated wastewater discharged into the environment can be the low willingness to pay for this kind of service and therefore a great focus should be given to all the technologies that are able to lower the treatment costs still maintaining reliable and robust performances in the long term. When considering wastewater as a carrier of valuable primary chemicals that can be easily converted to marketable products (fertilisers, bio-plastics, soil conditioners, biofuels, etc.), and as well as a relevant source of new water to be used for specific purposes, wastewater and runoff management can be highlighted as one of the most exciting challenges and occasions for a sustainable development in the near future. The paper aims to clarify the future role of CWs in circular economy, resource-oriented, and ecosystem services approaches, which want to respond to sanitation worldwide and the future research needs. We give an overview on how the conventional wastewater treatment scheme (what we call waste paradigm) should move towards more sustainable water and biogeochemical cycles following the new resource-oriented, circular economy and ecosystem service views. On this basis, we review the potential application of CWs within this new, and needed, paradigm. Finally, a meta-analysis shows that the scientific community involved in CWs should put more effort in making CWs more suitable for these new tasks. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Life cycle eco-efficiency metrics were then applied to evaluate potential environmental and economic trade-offs that may result from managing 1,000 end-of-life EV battery packs in the United States according to this CE hierarchy. Results indicate that if technology and markets support reuse of LIBs in used EVs, the net benefit would be 200,000 megajoules of recouped cumulative energy demand, which is equivalent to avoiding the production of 11 new EV battery packs (18 kilowatt-hours each). However, these benefits are magnified almost tenfold when retired EV LIBs are cascaded in a second use for stationary energy storage, thereby replacing the need to produce and use less-efficient lead-acid batteries. Reuse and cascaded use can also provide EV owners and the utility sector with cost savings, although the magnitude of future economic benefits is uncertain, given that future prices of battery systems are still unknown. In spite of these benefits, waste policies do not currently emphasize CE strategies like reuse and cascaded use for batteries. Though loop-closing LIB recycling provides valuable metal recovery, it can prove nonprofitable if high recycling costs persist. Although much attention has been placed on landfill disposal bans for batteries, results actually indicate that direct and cascaded reuse, followed by recycling, can together reduce eco-toxicity burdens to a much greater degree than landfill bans alone. Findings underscore the importance of life cycle and eco-efficiency analysis to understand at what point in a CE hierarchy the greatest environmental benefits are accrued and identify policies and mechanisms to increase feasibility of the proposed system.","[Richa, Kirti; Babbitt, Callie W.; Gaustad, Gabrielle] Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 190 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14618 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology,"Babbitt, CW (corresponding author), Rochester Inst Technol, Golisano Inst Sustainabil, 190 Lomb Mem Dr, Rochester, NY 14618 USA.",cwbgis@rit.edu,"Gaustad, Gabrielle/C-2377-2012","Babbitt, Callie/0000-0001-5093-2314","Golisano Institute for Sustainability; New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) under PON [18503]; National Science Foundation Environmental Sustainability directorate under Award [CBET-1254688]; National Science Foundation Environmental Health and Safety of Nanomaterials directorate under Award [CBET-1133425]; New York State Pollution Prevention Institute; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys [1254688] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Golisano Institute for Sustainability; New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) under PON; National Science Foundation Environmental Sustainability directorate under Award; National Science Foundation Environmental Health and Safety of Nanomaterials directorate under Award; New York State Pollution Prevention Institute; Directorate For Engineering; Div Of Chem, Bioeng, Env, & Transp Sys(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG))","The research team gratefully acknowledges funding from the Golisano Institute for Sustainability, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) under PON 18503, the National Science Foundation Environmental Sustainability directorate under Award CBET-1254688, the National Science Foundation Environmental Health and Safety of Nanomaterials directorate under Award CBET-1133425, and the New York State Pollution Prevention Institute.",,97,123,129,12,153,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1088-1980,1530-9290,,J IND ECOL,J.

J,"Tingley, DD; Cooper, S; Cullen, J",,,,"Tingley, Danielle Densley; Cooper, Simone; Cullen, Jonathan",,,"Understanding and overcoming the barriers to structural steel reuse, a UK perspective",JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Steel reuse; Embodied carbon; Barriers; Circular economy; Construction; Sustainability,DECONSTRUCTION; CONSTRUCTION,"To meet greenhouse gas emission targets, at global, national and sector level, reduction opportunities should be explored in both the embodied and operational carbon of the built environment One underexploited option to reduce embodied carbon is the reuse of structural steel. However, in the UK, work by Sansom and Avery (2014) suggests a picture of declining levels of reuse. This paper explores why this is the case by identifying the practical barriers to structural steel reuse through a series of semi structured interviews with UK construction industry members. Whilst there were many identified barriers, five practical barriers were prioritised as being most significant: cost, availability/storage, no client demand, traceability and supply chain gaps/lack of integration. These contrast with those most commonly identified in global literature: cost, supply chain gaps/integration, risk, jointing technique, composite construction and time for deconstruction; with only two overlaps: cost and supply chain gaps/integration. Many of the barriers from literature have a technical focus (reducing salvage yield rather than completely preventing reuse) differing from the largely systemic barriers that the interviews prioritised. These systemic barriers will need to be dealt with first to increase reuse rates. This will require a coordinated approach across the UK construction supply chain. Building on interview insights, this paper proposes four mechanisms to overcome these systemic barriers: (1) the creation of a database of suppliers/reused section availability, (2) a demonstration of client demand (3) technical guidance and education for the construction industry and (4) government leadership. Together these mechanisms would improve reuse rates in the UK, reduce the embodied emissions of the built environment and play a crucial role in meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.

This paper examines end-of-first-life applications of EVs batteries in a low-carbon circular economy following global transition to EVs and net zero economy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key actors within the EV industry in the UK. Drawing on Stahel closed-loop solutions, a qualitative analysis of the transcripts of these interviews revealed the need for business models towards coherent low-carbon circular economy of the value chains. This paper reveals a whole range of issues relating to: extraction of battery critical raw minerals (e.g. ethical concerns); manufacturing (e.g. lack of policy frameworks addressing value chain emissions); distribution and sale (e.g. gaps in circular built economy strategy and transition plan); use (e.g. lack of a functioning market for end-of-first-life batteries) as well as research and innovation (e.g. lack of infrastructure to deal with end-of- first-life cells). The views on policy weaknesses testifies to the need for close-loop business model to not only focus on recycling battery raw minerals or repurposing battery for energy storage applications. But, should consider many aspects of an innovative policy strategy and product's global value chain, accounting for: equitable jobs, critical raw minerals dependency, circularity governance and industry standards, protecting the natural environment, tackling emissions and ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. The study highlights establishing key trade-offs within policy goals considering the global value chains, as well as, harnessing synergies between social, economic and environmental goals. The paper concludes that a low-carbon close-loop business model should integrate the triple objectives of making positive impact on people, planet and profit, and developed on the basis of legislation, collaboration, research, investment, and incentives guiding to achieve the Global Goals.

However, they are not always desirable in their 'second life' and are a major bottleneck for chemical recycling. Although research on extraction techniques for efficient removal of additives is increasing, it resembles much like uncharted territory due to the broad variety of additives, plastics and removal techniques. Today solvent-based additive extraction techniques, solid-liquid extraction and dissolution-precipitation, are considered to be the most promising techniques to remove additives. This review focuses on the assessment of these techniques by making a link between literature and physicochemical principles such as diffusion and Hansen solubility theory. From a technical point of view, dissolution-precipitation is preferred to remove a broad spectrum of additives because diffusion limitations affect the solid-liquid extraction recoveries. Novel techniques such as accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) are promising for finding the balance between these two processes. Because of limited studies on the economic and environmental feasibility of extraction methods, this review also includes a basic economic and environmental assessment of two extreme cases for the extraction of additives. According to this assessment, the feasibility of additives removal depends strongly on the type of additive and plastic and also on the extraction conditions. In the best-case scenario at least 70% of solvent recovery is required to extract plasticizers from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) via dissolution-precipitation with tetrahydrofuran (THF), while solid-liquid extraction of phenolic antioxidants and a fatty acid amide slip agents from polypropylene (PP) with dichloromethane (DCM) can be economically viable even without intensive solvent recovery.

Circular business models help to prolong lifetimes of products and parts through successive cycles of reuse, repair, remanufacturing and closing material loops. To realise economic viability and reductions in environmental impacts from innovating towards a circular business model, integrated planning of the product lifecycle and value creation architectures for each cycle is pivotal. One key approach used to support business model innovation in management studies has been the visualisation of business models. Visual representations reduce complexity and reveal tacit structures to help understand and communicate the business model, generate and develop new business model ideas, and remove obstacles to innovation. However, for circular business models, there are no visualisation tools that help plan the product lifecycle in a way that creates and captures value from multiple use cycles and closed material loops, and that can capture how business model elements are adjusted to effectively implement each cycle. This paper presents a visualisation tool to map circular business models. The tool offers a standardised representation of the elements and possible cycles of circular business models to prolong the useful life of products and parts, and close material loops. A pilot case based on the company Fairphone exemplifies various potential benefits, including the tool's ability to reduce complexity and order potential interventions for embedding circularity in the business model. Suggestions for future research are made to refine and test the tool. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Nussholz, Julia L.

Soil has been described as the fragile, living skin of the Earth, and yet both its aliveness and fragility have all too often been ignored in the expansion of agriculture across the face of the globe. Since it is a pivotal component in a global nexus of soil-water-air-energy, how we treat the soil can impact massively on climate change - with either beneficial or detrimental consequences, depending on whether the soil is preserved or degraded. Regenerative agriculture has at its core the intention to improve the health of soil or to restore highly degraded soil, which symbiotically enhances the quality of water, vegetation and land-productivity. By using methods of regenerative agriculture, it is possible not only to increase the amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) in existing soils, but to build new soil. This has the effect of drawing down carbon from the atmosphere, while simultaneously improving soil structure and soil health, soil fertility and crop yields, water retention and aquifer recharge - thus ameliorating both flooding and drought, and also the erosion of further soil, since runoff is reduced. Since food production on a more local scale is found to preserve the soil and its quality, urban food production should be seen as a significant potential contributor to regenerative agriculture in the future, so long as the methods employed are themselves 'regenerative'. If localisation is to become a dominant strategy for dealing with a vastly reduced use of fossil fuels, and preserving soil quality - with increased food production in towns and cities - it will be necessary to incorporate integrated ('systems') design approaches such as permaculture and the circular economy (which minimise and repurpose 'waste') within the existing urban infrastructure. In addition to growing food in urban space, such actions as draught-proofing and thermally insulating existing building stock, and living/working on a more local scale, would serve well to cut our overall energy consumption. In order to curb our use of fossil fuels, methods for reducing overall energy use must be considered at least equally important to expanding low-carbon energy production. In synopsis, it is clear that only by moving from the current linear, 'take, make, dispose waste-creation)' model for resource-consumption, to the systemic, circular alternative of 'reduce, reuse, recycle, regenerate', are we likely to meet demands for future generations.",,,,cjrhodes@freshlands.com,,,,,,,125,122,137,21,447,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0036-8504,2047-7163,,SCI PROGRESS-UK,Sci.

Recently, DEA has been extended to processes with two stages. Two-stage processes usually have undesirable intermediate outputs, which are normally considered be unrecoverable final outputs. In many real situations like industrial production however, many first-stage waste products can be immediately used or processed in the second stage to produce new resources which can be fed back immediately to the first stage. The objective of this paper is to provide an approach for analyzing the reuse of undesirable intermediate outputs in a two-stage production process with a shared resource. Shared resources are input resources that not only are used by both the first and second stages but also have the property that the proportion used by each stage cannot be conveniently split up and allocated to the operations of the two stages. Additive efficiency measures and non-cooperative efficiency measures are proposed to illustrate the overall efficiency of each DMU and respective efficiency of each sub-DMU. In the non-cooperative framework, a heuristic algorithm is suggested to transform the nonlinear model into a parametric linear one. A real case of industrial production processes of 30 provincial level regions in mainland China in 2010 was analyzed to verify the applicability of the proposed approaches. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Innovative and multi faced solutions are continuously being proposed, tested and implemented by researchers, government authorities, non-government bodies and food industries to tackle this problem of food waste. Insect-based bioconversions have been reported as a marketable solution for reducing food waste. This rather novel approach can efficiently convert several tonnes of food waste into valuable products including human food, animal feed, fertiliser and other secondary industrial compounds. This paper couples the production of edible insects with the valorisation of food waste, providing an attractive key for closing the loop of food value chain. Current status of insect processing and their importance in circular economy is also discussed in detail. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

At around 924 million tons in the European Union in 2016 and 2.36 billion tons in China in 2018, the amount is expected to increase over the next few years. Dumping these wastes in sanitary landfills has always been the traditional approach to waste management but this will not be feasible in the years to come. To significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of CDW being dumped, circular economy is a possible solution to the increasing amounts of CDW. Circular economy is an economic system based on business models which replaces the end-of-life concept with reducing, reusing, recycling, and recovering materials. This paper discusses circular economy (CE) frameworks-specifically material recovery and production highlighting the reuse and recycling of CDW and reprocessing into new construction applications. Likewise, a literature review into recent studies of reuse and recycling of CDW and its feasibility is also discussed to possibly prove the effectivity of CE in reducing CDW. Findings such as effectivity of recycling CDW into new construction applications and its limitations in effective usage are discussed and research gaps such as reuse of construction materials are also undertaken. CE and recycling were also found to be emerging topics. Observed trends in published articles as well as the use of latent Dirichlet allocation in creating topic models have shown a rising awareness and increasing research in CE which focuses on recycling and reusing CDW.","[Ginga, Clarence P.; Ongpeng, Jason Maximino C.; Daly, Ma.

Furthermore, decreasing fossil-based plastic usage is an important aspect of sustainability. As an alternative to fossil-based plastics in the market, bio-based plastics are gaining in popularity. According to the studies conducted, products with similar performance characteristics can be obtained using biological feedstocks instead of fossil-based sources. In particular, bioplastic production from microalgae is a new opportunity to be explored and further improved. The aim of this study is to determine the current state of bioplastic production technologies from microalgae species and reveal possible optimization opportunities in the process and application areas.

Both at EU and Member State level, circular economy and resource efficiency policies are promoting production of lower-impact building materials with secondary material input. However, secondary material strategies do not result in carbon saving by default, and depend on businesses developing effective and economic applications that can overcome the many barriers to closing material loops. This paper aims to advance understanding of the relevance of secondary material for decarbonisation of the building sector, as well as the interplay of business model innovation and policy instruments in this transition. We used a comparative case study of three pioneering Scandinavian companies that produce circular building materials to estimate the carbon saving potential of using secondary material. We also examined business model innovations to implement strategies, and companies' experienced and desired policies to help remove barriers. The results show clearly that all three cases offer potential for carbon savings. As the savings vary significantly, findings suggest that careful consideration of affected processes and markets is a key to attaining carbon savings. Business model innovations to enable secondary material use involve establishing key partnerships to access secondary materials, developing recovery process and technology, targeting customer segments that value lower environmental impacts, and considering life cycle costs. Public policies that can help companies remove barriers include 1) incorporating reuse of higher material value in construction and demolition waste targets, and 2) incentivising waste collection and recovery markets to offer recovered material at higher value.","[Nussholz, Julia L.

Anaerobic digestion (AD) of organic wastes is a preferred option in the waste management hierarchy, as this process can generate renewable energy, reduce emissions from waste storage, and produce fertiliser material. However, Nitrate Vulnerable Zone legislation and seasonal restrictions can limit the use of digestate on agricultural land. In this paper we demonstrate the potential of cultivating microalgae on digestate as a feedstock, either directly after dilution, or indirectly from effluent remaining after biofertiliser extraction. Resultant microalgal biomass can then be used to produce livestock feed, biofuel or for higher value bio-products. The approach could mitigate for possible regional excesses, and substitute conventional high-impact products with bio-resources, enhancing sustainability within a circular economy. Recycling nutrients from digestate with algal technology is at an early stage. We present and discuss challenges and opportunities associated with developing this new technology.","[Stiles, William A.

However, for several reasons the effects of governmental policy actions on industrial symbiosis are still not clear. This article proposes a research agenda to clarify the mechanisms of policy intervention and facilitation of industrial symbiosis based on a comprehensive review of industrial symbiosis literature, focusing on how policy is conceptualized and studied. The results show that existing research lacks an explicit definition of policy, and employs a static conceptualization of policy that is reinforced by comparative statics research methods. We argue that a dynamic process perspective is crucial to reveal the actual mechanisms through which policy intervention and facilitation affect the evolution of industrial symbiosis. Building on this view, industrial symbiosis research is connected with insights from policy sciences, and the case of policy translation of Circular Economy and Eco-industrial Park in China is investigated in order to illustrate that policy is at heart a dynamic process. We conclude with a research agenda proposing that the key to reveal the mechanisms is to identify the sequence of events connecting policy process and industrial symbiosis practices.

The CE is an alternative to the current take, make, waste extractive industrial model and offers a practical solution to address global and local environmental challenges, such as resource depletion, marine plastic pollution, and for staying within planetary system boundaries. Although the CE and related concepts such as cradle to cradle provide a most promising alternative to the traditional linear economy model and its impacts on the planets eco-systems, some of the CE key elements have raised debate both in the academic community and among policy makers. One of the debates concerns the missing social or human dimensions of the CE. Likewise, the HD approach lacks considerations of environmental sustainability. Drawing on both academic and grey literature and the authorso research observations and professional experiences in the fields of promoting the CE and international development cooperation for HD, we attempt to develop an integrative conceptual framework of the CE and HD. This framework includes social-economic elements of the transformation from linear to circular economic models, combined with HD from the social sciences and development studies. We thereby complement the technological-material focused CE model that is primarily based on principles of industrial ecology and engineering. We utilize the existing 'circular humansphereo concept to articulate the incorporation of HD into the discussion of CE. By bringing in explicit links with HD, we pursue a double aim: First, to raise awareness and understanding among the CE research community of the missing human dimension in current CE discourse, and second, to familiarise the international development community with the approaches of CE. This will advance the options for adopting CE practices in international development programmes and for the process of implementing the social SDGs concerning HD such as SDG 1, 3, 4, 5, and 10. Finally, we hope that this CE and HD framework can contribute to the resolution of environmental and developmental issues.",,,,pschroeder@chathamhouse.org,,,,,,,82,120,122,4,28,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0921-3449,1879-0658,,RESOUR CONSERV RECY,Resour.

However, studies exploring CE practices in the context of leather industry have been scant. To deal with this issue, this paper proposes a decision support framework for evaluating the challenges to CE practices in the context of leather industry. Best worst method, a generic decision support tool, is employed in the assessment process. The study findings reveal that lack of financial support from authorities is assigned the highest weight in the final ranking results. This indicates that the lack of financial facility poses a major challenge to the successful implementation of CE practices.

However, realising a circular economy has ran into various biophysical constraints. Circular economy implementation is shaped by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's butterfly diagram that depicts 'biological' and 'technical' flows as separate cycles, subsequently interpreted as organic materials circulating in open loop systems via the environment and inorganic materials circulating in closed loop systems within society. Conversely, in our view, resource flows often contain tightly bound combinations of organic and inorganic materials either due to their natural composition or due to their technical design. Building on this observation, a new diagram is proposed that broadens the scope of the circular economy to cover extractive sectors and the return of materials from anthropogenic use to natural reserves, thereby reshaping the conceptual space within which solutions such as effective zero-waste-residue technologies, business models, and policies can be developed for the optimal management of integrated resources from a whole-system perspective. The diagram offers a realistic outlook on the biophysical limitations of circularity and endeavours to inspire discussion that supports the transition towards a sustainable circular economy.

It investigates the technology, innovation and systemic changes required to enable circular supply chains. Design/methodology/approach The research study uses a qualitative, interpretivist approach, drawing on in-depth semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the Scandinavian fashion industry. Findings The main inhibitors to textile-to-textile recycling systems in the Scandinavian fashion industry are: limited technology which creates a challenge for separating materials; high costs of research and development and building the supporting logistics; complexity of supply chains including the multitude of stakeholders involved in product development. The enablers are design and use of new materials, increased garment collection and collaboration. This research suggests that sorting and recycling technology can be enhanced with the use of digital technologies, as this would create transparency, traceability and automatisation. Originality/value Understanding of textile-to-textile recycling is emerging both theoretically and practically, however, there is still much that is not understood. This research contributes to furthering understanding of how technology, collaboration and systemic change in the fashion industry can support opportunities for textile-to-textile recycling, thereby aligning with circular economy principles.","[Sandvik, Ida Marie; Stubbs, Wendy] Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Monash University,"Sandvik, IM (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",ida_m_sand@hotmail.com; wendy.stubbs@monash.edu,,,,,,,66,120,123,33,244,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1361-2026,1758-7433,,J FASH MARK MANAG,J.

However, little attention has been paid to the potential environmental and human health related impacts associated with PV systems, if not managed properly at the end-of-life (EoL). Rare materials such as ruthenium, gallium, indium, and tellurium are essential components in PV panels, while battery energy storage systems (BESS) are composed of various chemistries (i.e. lithium-ion, lead acid, nickel cadmium, salt water, and flow batteries). An appropriate EoL management strategy for solar photovoltaic systems (i.e. PV modules, BESS) is necessary, not only to prevent and/or mitigate future environmental problems but also to reduce demand on rare earth materials. Drawn from a portfolio of 191 papers collected from Scopus and Web of Science databases between 2000 and 2018 (by 30 June 2018), a systematic quantitative literature review on solar energy systems EoL studies was conducted to examine the temporal trend of current research as well as methodological and geographical distributions of the published articles. Research has been concentrated within Europe, some parts of Asia, and North America, with experimental and modelling/simulation methods being mostly applied. The focus of this study was to compile and synthesise reported drivers, barriers, and enablers to EoL management of PV panels and BESS in the context of the circular economy. A conceptual framework is proposed to facilitate the transition of current PV system material flows and supply chain management practices to circular economy concepts.

These REMs have been brought in a framework distinguishing on the one hand a cluster of supply side measures, demand side measures and life cycle measures with a synergistic mode of operation. They further have been related to clear classes or Business Model Changes (BMCs) that can support their implementation, notably changes in the supply chain (SC), internal processes customer interface (CI), financial model (FM) and the value proposition (VP). The BMCs were further characterised in terms of typical Implementation Barriers (IBS) that were reported in the cases, i.e. institutional, market, organisational, behavioural and technological barriers. Our study could not confirm some common theoretical wisdom, such as that firms mainly focus on 'simple' REMs like cleaner production and green products. Indeed, we could not confirm that REMs with a high scope and degree of change, often perceived as complex to implement, faced more Implementation Barriers than others. In general most Implementation Barriers play a role in all types of REMs and BMCs, although also some weak patterns were found. Internal processes BMCs were mainly hampered by institutional and technological factors. Value proposition and Financial model BMCs faced mainly behavioural and market barriers. Customer interface BMCs encountered additionally organisational barriers, while supply chain BMCs face a mix of all classes of barriers distinguished in this study. This is one of the first studies on business models and resource-efficiency looking at a large set of cases which is a step forward from the single case studies that dominate current literature. Yet, follow-up research should overcome weaknesses in our approach, such as a possible bias towards success cases and be more quantitative in analysing the effort it takes to overcome IBs.","[Lopez, Fernando J.

In this study, we demonstrate that by coupling different types of indicators via Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) it is possible to deal with conflicting situations where the selection of the best alternative can be biased by the choice of the metric. We use a beer packaging case, by simulating a situation where a company is interested in comparing the performances of different packaging from a CE perspective. We consider eight different beer packaging alternatives in two geographical contexts (United Kingdom and India). Two sets of indicators are coupled via MCDA: i) material circularity based-indicators, namely Material Reutilization Score and Material Circularity Indicator, and ii) a selection of life cycle based indicators relevant for beer, i.e. climate change, abiotic resource depletion, acidification, particulate matter and water consumption. The results obtained by the application of the TOPSIS (Technique for Order by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method show that the different sets of indicators can be integrated and conflicts among them can be resolved. Overall, the application of different weighting scenarios does not change the ranking of the alternatives, thus confirming that the results are stable. Therefore, our proposal of coupling material circularity indicators with LCA indicators via MCDA can advance the assessment of CE strategies at the product level.","[Niero, Monia] Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning Sustainable Design & Transit, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Kalbar, Pradip P.] Indian Inst Technol, CUSE, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Kalbar, Pradip P.] Indian Inst Technol, Interdisciplinary Programme IDP Climate Studies, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India",Aalborg University; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay; Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Bombay,"Niero, M (corresponding author), Aalborg Univ, Dept Planning Sustainable Design & Transit, AC Meyers Vaenge 15, DK-2450 Copenhagen, Denmark.",monian@plan.aau.dk,"Niero, Monia/AAD-4921-2022; Niero, Monia/IXD-3195-2023; Kalbar, Pradip/N-2734-2015","Kalbar, Pradip/0000-0002-1436-3609; Niero, Monia/0000-0001-6275-6944",Carlsberg Foundation,Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation),Monia Niero would like to thank the Carlsberg Foundation for funding the project Absolute Circular Economy (ACE) toolkit to support companies in the implementation of Circular Economy strategies from an Absolute environmental sustainability perspective.

Bioplastics are a growing industry but still account for less than 1% of the total plastic production. Cellulose and starch are abundant, widely available plant polymers that are used extensively for paper, packaging, food service items, bags and biofuels. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) which is derived from starch by a fermentation process and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) which are renewable, microbial derived biodegradable polyesters that can be processed similar to various commodity plastics. Both polymers are projected to grasp an increasing market share of commodity plastics as production costs drop. Other synthetic biodegradable polyesters and plant-based commodity plastics are commercially available and have expanding markets. The growing use of plant-based materials will have environmental benefits including waste reduction, lower greenhouse gas emissions, promote rural investment, reduce the volume of harmful chemicals/pollutants, conserve ecosystems and biodiversity, and will help transition to the circular economy.

This sector also contributes a third of the annual EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accordingly, construction represents one priority area for intervention within the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy. Increasing resource efficiency through slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy loops, is key to mitigating climate change. However, this review paper demonstrates that the analysis of links between circular economy solutions and climate change mitigation has been scarce, despite a recent sharp increase in related literature, with 20 articles (83%) published in 2018-2019. Slowing resource solutions have been the focus of the research and could bring up to 99% savings in GHG emissions per functional unit, where material reuse stands out as the most promising alternative. Closing resource solutions can reduce emissions by 30-50% per functional unit, but results are highly dependent on recycling efficiencies and transportation distances to recovery facilities. Solutions for narrowing resource loops can bring additional GHG savings, but they remain understudied. Despite the promising results for mitigating GHG emissions, this article argues that the circular economy solutions do not always result by default in emission reductions and that a case-by-case quantification is crucial. The implementation of these solutions should be accompanied with further methodological development, such as proper allocation procedures, accurate definition of the system boundaries and integration of forecasts.

Considering the literature on sustainability and supply chain performances, the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores appear to be an indicator of sustainability performances. The majority of papers related to sustainability are to assess the sustainability performance using various tools and methods. However, there is limited research that analyses those sustainability assessment results and use the results for improving the future sustainability performance. This research fills this gap by demonstrating the use of grey theory in analysing ESG score for Indian firms. To this end, we study the sustainability performances of 39 firms in the Indian context, listed in the Thomson Reuters ESG scores that are consistently rated for their Environmental, Social, and Governance performances, for a period of 5 years from 2014 to 2018. A grey incidence analysis is used to study the most important indicators or attributes contributing to the sustainability performances of the Indian firms. This is important for the continuous improvement of the firm or its supply chains towards sustainability and to enhance the visibility of supply chains to stakeholders. It is observed from the results of the analysis that the Resource use score, the Environmental innovation score, and the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy score emerges as the most important indicators contributing to Environmental, Social, and Governance performances of Indian firms. Whereas, the Shareholders score, the Management score, and the Human rights score appears to be among the least determining indicators, in the Indian context to achieving total Environmental, Social, and Governance performances. The research throws insights into the areas of poor performances of firms to achieving sustainability in Indian context. As we observe that two out of the three identified areas, the Shareholders score and the Management score appears in the Governance performance side of evaluation in ESG, the implications are uncovered in the direction of improving the Governance performance of Indian firms.

The method of sanitary landfilling for final disposal of waste remains a generally accepted and used method but the available scientific evidence on the waste-related environmental and health effects is not conclusive. Comparative studies of various WM methods (landfilling, incineration, composting etc.) show that among the municipal solid waste (MSW) treatment and disposal technological options, sanitary landfilling or open dumping is popular in most countries because of the relative low cost and low-technical requirement. The European Union (EU) Directive on waste landfills has introduced specific goals for reducing the volume of disposed waste and very strict requirements for landfilling and landfill sites. Evaluation of the impact of landfills on the environment is a crucial topic in the literature and has received increased attention recently, given growing environmental concerns. The main goal of this survey was to conduct a comprehensive assessment of possible impacts of MSW landfills on the environment. The main conclusion of the overall assessment of the literature is that the disposal of MSW in landfills entails a number of environmental risks but with respect to the current situation and rich style of living adopted in industrially developed countries, the idea of WM systems functioning without landfilling-at least in the foreseeable future within one generation-seems to be somewhat unreal. The results also provided important information of landfills as a source of environmental risk. Results of this research may have an important impact on landfill management and the disposal of waste. From the literature review, it is evident that even if high levels of waste avoidance, reuse and recycling are achieved, some waste materials will always need to be forwarded for disposal.","[Vaverkova, Magdalena Daria] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac AgriSci, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Vaverkova, Magdalena Daria] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, SGGW, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland",Mendel University in Brno; Warsaw University of Life Sciences,"Vaverková, MD (corresponding author), Mendel Univ Brno, Fac AgriSci, Dept Appl & Landscape Ecol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.;Vaverková, MD (corresponding author), Warsaw Univ Life Sci, SGGW, Fac Civil & Environm Engn, Nowoursynowska 159, PL-02776 Warsaw, Poland.",magda.vaverkova@uake.cz,"Vaverková, Magdalena Daria/I-3726-2019","Vaverková, Magdalena Daria/0000-0002-2384-6207",,,,,116,118,127,9,108,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2076-3263,,GEOSCIENCES,Geosciences,OCT,2019,9,10,,,,,,,431,10.3390/geosciences9100431,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/geosciences9100431,,,16,"Geosciences, Multidisciplinary",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Geology,JP4YB,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000498271100027,View Full Record in Web of Science

An innovative pre-treatment technology using free ammonia (FA, i.e. NH3) was proposed in this study to increase anaerobic methane production. The solubilisation of secondary sludge was significantly increased after FA pre-treatment at up to 680 mg NH3-N/L. for 1 day, under which the solubilisation (i.e. 0.4 mg SCOD/mg VS; SCOD: soluble chemical oxygen demand; VS: volatile solids) was >10 times higher than that without FA pre-treatment (i.e. 0.03 mg SCOD/mg VS). Biochemical methane potential assays showed that FA pre-treatment at above 250 mg NH3-N/L is effective in improving anaerobic methane production. The highest improvement in biochemical methane potential (B-0) and hydrolysis rate (k) was achieved at FA concentrations of 420-680 mg NH3-N/L, and was determined as approximately 22% (from 160 to 195 L CH4/kg VS added) and 140% (from 0.22 to 0.53 d(-1)) compared to the secondary sludge without pre-treatment. More analysis revealed that the FA induced improvement in B-0 and k could be attributed to the rapidly biodegradable substances rather than the slowly biodegradable substances. Economic and environmental analyses showed that the FA-based technology is economically favourable and environmentally friendly. Since this FA technology aims to use the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) waste (i.e. anaerobic digestion liquor) to enhance methane production from the WWTPs, it will set an example for the paradigm shift of the WWTPs from 'linear economy' to 'circular economy'.
