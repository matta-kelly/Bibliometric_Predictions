Urban computing aims to tackle these issues by using the data that has been generated in cities (e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and geographical data). Urban computing connects urban sensing, data management, data analytics, and service providing into a recurrent process for an unobtrusive and continuous improvement of people's lives, city operation systems, and the environment. Urban computing is an interdisciplinary field where computer sciences meet conventional city-related fields, like transportation, civil engineering, environment, economy, ecology, and sociology in the context of urban spaces. This article first introduces the concept of urban computing, discussing its general framework and key challenges from the perspective of computer sciences. Second, we classify the applications of urban computing into seven categories, consisting of urban planning, transportation, the environment, energy, social, economy, and public safety and security, presenting representative scenarios in each category. Third, we summarize the typical technologies that are needed in urban computing into four folds, which are about urban sensing, urban data management, knowledge fusion across heterogeneous data, and urban data visualization. Finally, we give an outlook on the future of urban computing, suggesting a few research topics that are somehow missing in the community.","[Zheng, Yu] Microsoft Res, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China; [Capra, Licia] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Wolfson, Ouri] Univ Illinois, Dept Comp Sci, Chicago, IL USA; [Yang, Hai] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Microsoft; University of London; University College London; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Zheng, Y (corresponding author), Microsoft Res, Bldg 2,5 Danling St, Beijing 100080, Peoples R China.",yuzheng@microsoft.com; ucaclca@ucl.ac.uk; wolfson@cs.uic.edu; cehyang@ust.hk,"Yang, Hai/F-8848-2011; Zheng, Yu/GRJ-5808-2022; Yang, Hai/JQI-4956-2023","Yang, Hai/0000-0001-5210-8468;",,,,,163,766,807,34,378,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY USA",2157-6904,2157-6912,,ACM T INTEL SYST TEC,ACM Trans.

By protecting soil from wind and water erosion, terrestrial ecosystems supply human beings with soil erosion control service, one of the fundamental ecosystem services that ensure human welfare. The Loess Plateau was one of the regions in the world that suffered from severe soil erosion. In the past decades, restoration projects were implemented to improve soil erosion control in the region. The Grain-to-Green project, converting slope croplands into forest or grasslands, launched in 1999 was the most massive one. It is needed to assess the change of soil erosion control service brought about by the project. This study evaluated the land cover changes from 2000 to 2008 by satellite image interpretation. Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was employed for the soil erosion control assessment for the same period with localized parameters. Soil retention calculated as potential soil erosion (erosion without vegetation cover) minus actual soil erosion was applied as indicator for soil erosion control service. The results indicate that ecosystem soil erosion control service has been improved from 2000 to 2008 as a result of vegetation restoration. Average soil retention rate (the ratio of soil retention to potential soil loss in percentage) was up to 63.3% during 2000-2008. Soil loss rate in 34% of the entire plateau decreased, 48% unchanged and 18% slightly increased. Areas suffering from intense erosion shrank and light erosion areas expanded. Zones with slope gradient of 8 degrees-35 degrees were the main contribution area of soil loss. On average, these zones produced 82% of the total soil loss with 45.5% of the total area in the Loess Plateau. Correspondingly, soil erosion control capacity was significantly improved in these zones. Soil loss rate decreased from 5000 t km(-2) yr(-1) to 3600 t km(-2) yr(-1), 6900 t km(-2) yr(-1) to 4700 t km(-2) yr(-1), and 8500 t km(-2) yr(-1) to 5500 t km(-2) yr(-1) in the zones with slope gradient of 8 degrees-15 degrees, 15 degrees-25 degrees, and 25 degrees-35 degrees respectively. However, the mean soil erosion rate in areas with slope gradient over 8 degrees was still larger than 3600 t km(-2) yr(-1), which is far beyond the tolerable erosion rate of 1000 t km(-2) yr(-1). Thus, soil erosion is still one of the top environmental problems that need more ecological restoration efforts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It has been demonstrated that regional climate models (RCMs) provide more reliable results for a regional impact study of climate change (e.g., on water resources) than general circulation models (GCMs). However, due to their considerable bias it is still necessary to apply bias correction before they are used for water resources research. In this paper, after a sensitivity analysis on input meteorological variables based on the Sobol' method, we compared five precipitation correction methods and three temperature correction methods in downscaling RCM simulations applied over the Kaidu River basin, one of the headwaters of the Tarim River basin. Precipitation correction methods applied include linear scaling (LS), local intensity scaling (LOCI), power transformation (PT), distribution mapping (DM) and quantile mapping (QM), while temperature correction methods are LS, variance scaling (VARI) and DM. The corrected precipitation and temperature were compared to the observed meteorological data, prior to being used as meteorological inputs of a distributed hydrologic model to study their impacts on streamflow. The results show (1) streamflows are sensitive to precipitation, temperature and solar radiation but not to relative humidity and wind speed; (2) raw RCM simulations are heavily biased from observed meteorological data, and its use for streamflow simulations results in large biases from observed streamflow, and all bias correction methods effectively improved these simulations; (3) for precipitation, PT and QM methods performed equally best in correcting the frequency-based indices (e.g., standard deviation, percentile values) while the LOCI method performed best in terms of the time-series-based indices (e.g., Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, R-2); (4) for temperature, all correction methods performed equally well in correcting raw temperature; and (5) for simulated streamflow, precipitation correction methods have more significant influence than temperature correction methods and the performances of streamflow simulations are consistent with those of corrected precipitation; i.e., the PT and QM methods performed equally best in correcting flow duration curve and peak flow while the LOCI method performed best in terms of the time-series-based indices. The case study is for an arid area in China based on a specific RCM and hydrologic model, but the methodology and some results can be applied to other areas and models.","[Fang, G.

Exponential growth of population and urbanization, and the development of social economy, coupled with the improvement of living standard, have resulted in an increase in the amount of MSW generation throughout the world. On average the developed countries typically generate 521.95-759.2 kg per person per year (kpc) and 109.5-525.6 kpc typically by developing countries. Recent estimates suggest that the MSW generation globally exceeds 2 billion tons per year, which is a potential threat to environmental dilapidation. Therefore, MSW management (MSWM) seems to be one of the key topics for environmental protection in present days and also in the future. The authors have illustrated MSW generation and composition analysis and have provided a comprehensive review of MSWM in different countries throughout the world based on the available literatures.

Results show the cities are classified into four categories: joint high class (7 cites), social economy-high class (5 cites), joint-low class (9 cites), and ecological environment-high class (10 cites). We also discussed key issues existing in the coupling coordinated development. Beijing, Hangzhou, etc. show the best coupling coordinated degrees, presenting harmonious relationship between advanced social economy and sound eco-environment. Yinchuan and Lhasa rank at the bottom in the studied cities in terms of coupling coordinated development, they need to promote social economic development conforming to the unique ecological environment and capacity to achieve coordinated development.

Drawing on dynamic capability theory, we hypothesized that green entrepreneurial orientation has positive influences on two types of firm performance. The relationship between green entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance is moderated by green technology dynamism and knowledge transfer and integration. We tested the research hypotheses using data from 264 Chinese firms. The results indicate that green entrepreneurial orientation has positive influences on both environmental and financial performance. In addition, green technology dynamism only negatively moderates the relationship between green entrepreneurial orientation and environmental performance, while knowledge transfer and integration positively moderates the relationships between green entrepreneurial orientation and environmental and financial performance. This study enhances our understanding on green entrepreneurial orientation, described as a dynamic capability, can exploit new ideas and encourage innovativeness, show a propensity to catch potential opportunities, and take risks in transforming the social economy into the social-ecological economy.

Combining AHP with GIS provides an effective means for studies of regional eco-environmental evaluation. Aiming at the regional features of eco-environment and main environmental problems of Hunan Province, the synthetic evaluation index system was set up including natural environment, disaster, environment pollution and social economy factors. Supported by GIS, taking the county as the evaluation unit, the regional eco-environmental information system database and evaluated the eco-environmental quality of Hunan Province were established. Based on the database and evaluation system, AHP, eco-environmental evaluation index method and spatial analysis were integrated into the eco-environmental quality evaluation in the study area. The results showed that 35.2% of the total land area in Hunan Province (approximately 68462.45 km(2)) maintains a good or better grade of the eco-environmental equality. However, 22.8% of the total area (approximately 44345.00 km(2)) was of a bad or worse grade of eco-environment quality. From the spatial distribution, the eco-environmental quality gradually decreased from the east to the west with exception in a few areas, which presented the obvious speciality of terrain. It was concluded that the current status of the integral eco-environment quality of Hunan Province was in the middle level, and highly intense human activities speeded up the degradation of regional eco-environments in recent years.

Studying the relationship between urbanization and landscape patterns can provide supports for urban ecological management. Previous studies have examined the quantitative relationship between the social economy and landscape patterns of an entire region, but have not considered the spatial non-stability of this relationship. In this study, we characterized the landscape patterns in Beijing City, China during 2000 and 2010 using four landscape metrics, i.e. patch density (PD), edge density (ED), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and the aggregation index (AI). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) was employed to identify the spatial heterogeneity and evolution characteristics of the relationship between the urbanization of population density (POP), gross domestic production (GDP) and nighttime lighting (NTL), and landscape patterns. The evolution of urban landscape patterns indicated a decentralized, aggregated, and fragmented change from the downtown to the suburb and outer suburb. During the 10-year period, the average PD in the downtown increased by 100.6%, and the increase of AI in the suburb was the largest. The PD, ED and SHDI increased by different degrees in the outer suburb. The influences of different urbanization modes on landscape patterns were also different. Inning mode made the landscape patterns more regular and integrated. The landscape was more broken and complicated under the edge-expanding mode, and the leapfrog mode made PD and SHDI increase slightly. In the relationship interpretation, GWR effectively identified the spatial heterogeneity, and improved the explanatory ability compared to ordinary least squares (OLS). The most intense response to urbanization was the forest landscape and the forest-cultivated land ecotone in the northwest of Beijing City, indicating that this region was ecologically fragile. The population density in the urbanization index had a direct effect on landscape patterns, while the PD affected by urbanization was greater than the shape, aggregation and diversity index. Affected by development policy, urban planning and other factors, the explanation degree of social economy to landscape patterns decreased in 2010. GWR is an effective method for quantifying the spatial differentiation characteristics of urbanization impacts on landscape patterns, which can provide more spatial information and decision criteria for the green development of a compact city.","[Li, Huilei; Peng, Jian; Liu Yanxu; Hu Yi'na] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Peng, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Key Lab Earth Surface Proc, Minist Educ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",jianpeng@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Peng, Jian/AAO-6397-2020; Liu, Yanxu/JOZ-4430-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41322004],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41322004).,,58,198,222,30,359,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

While aware of the ambiguity of civil society's role in rebuilding governance relationships, it is argued that, under certain conditions, civil society is found to be a valuable contributor towards more cohesive cities and governance arrangements that promote them.

Optimizing the production-living-ecological space has become one of the cores of China's ecological civilization and sustainable development strategy. Research of the coupling coordination relationships among rural production, living and ecological functions is of immense significance for sustainable rural development during urban-rural transfor-mation development. In this study, an evaluation index system was established to calculate and characterize rural production-living-ecological functions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. Besides, this paper ex-plored the spatio-temporal characteristics of both the coupling and coordinating relationship of the rural three fundamental functions from 2000 to 2015 in the study area, using a coupling coordination degree model (CCDM). Results showed that the spatio-temporal differences of the coupling coordination degree of rural production-living-ecological function were significant in the BTH region. The overall spatial pattern was char-acterized by high in the northwest and low in the southeast distribution and the entirety presented the evo-lution law of coupled and coordinated development from low level to high level over time. Moreover, rural production-living, living-ecological and production-ecological functions present marked differences in spatio-temporal pattern. In the future, the differentiated rural sustainable development strategy should be formulated and implemented based on the rules of spatio-temporal pattern differentiation of the rural production-living -ecological functions. This research will provide a decision-making reference for promoting the coordinated development among rural production-living-ecological functions and implementing the rural revitalization strategy to achieve the goal of rural sustainability.","[Yang, Yuanyuan; Bao, Wenkai; Liu, Yansui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuanyuan; Bao, Wenkai; Liu, Yansui] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yuanyuan; Bao, Wenkai; Liu, Yansui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resource & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Liu, YS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",liuys@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Bao, Wenkai/AAZ-8418-2021; yang, yuanyuan/HPG-2020-2023; LIU, Yansui/T-6954-2019","Liu, Yansui/0000-0001-6636-7313","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601173, 41931293, 41731286]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was funded by the grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41601173, 41931293, 41731286).

This paper evaluated the sustainability of the 9 China's national central cities using the coupling coordination model. In the evaluation process, an objective coupling weighting method was developed by the combination of the coupling analysis and the sequential relationship analysis method. The validity of this method was illustrated by comparing the coordination level of the cities with that obtained by the entropy method. Long-term use of this method can guide the coordination development among economy, society and environment of cities. The assessment results indicate that the coordination development among economy, society and environment of the cities was not ideal. Only one city, Beijing, located in the good coordination grade. The main reason is the lower development of economic sustainability. Policy recommendations were provided to address the problem. In addition, the paper concludes that there is a great room for improvement in the coordinated development of the cities, because they showed an increase trend in coordinated development and the economic growth rate was relatively high.

To investigate the relationship of coupling coordination between social economy and water environment on urban scale, we introduced an integrated approach that enables the dynamic evaluation of coupling coordination degree (CCD), which consists of a system dynamics model and a coupling coordination degree model; and applied it to a case study in Kunming in 2016-2025. The business-as usual (BAU) scenario and five alternative regulating scenarios are simulated to evaluate the effectiveness exerted by various socioeconomic development patterns and water protection efforts in improving CCD. We found that the improvement of CCD could attribute to both the sufficient water protection efforts and the maintaining sustainable speed and scale of socioeconomic development patterns. Under BAU scenario, Kunming would maintain the current state of barely balanced development with CCD at 0.5-0.8, predominantly due to substantial water consumption and pollution. Through the comparison of dynamic evolutions of system indicators and CCD under five alternative regulating scenarios, it is realistic for Kunming to plan its future development in accordance to M-H scenario (Medium-speed socioeconomic development pattern; High-intensity water protection effort). Following this scenario, Kunming's CCD would conform to a steadily increasing trend in 2016-2025 and remain above 0.8 in 2022-2025, tracing a shift in the development stage of that coupling coordination from barely balanced development to highly balanced development despite the difficulty to cut NH3-N emission significantly. The effective and feasible regulatory measures such as reducing productive or domestic water pollutants and consumptions; improving collection and reuse rates of wastewater, should be prioritized when adjusting coordination development during decision-making.","[Cui, Dan; Chen, Xin; Xue, Yinglan; Li, Rui; Zeng, Weihua] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Zeng, WH (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Joint Lab Environm Simulat & Pollut Con, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",cuidan2016@mail.bnu.edu.cn; zengwh@bnu.edu.cn,"jam, amir/O-6460-2019; Zeng, Weihua/Q-1774-2019; Zeng, weihua/AAB-3169-2019",,Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2018ZX07111003],Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment,This research is supported by the Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment (No. 2018ZX07111003).,,39,145,159,20,310,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

These crises have provoked a wide variety of management solutions and alternatives that are closely aligned with other small-scale resource extraction conservation approaches, but have been analyzed separately from the common-pool resource management literature. We summarize findings from an analysis of progressive small-scale fisheries worldwide and find that solutions arise from a historical trial and error management process as problems become dire. We find high success in the social organization and regulation of resources among these progressive fisheries but poor evidence for improved ecosystems. Based on evidence provided by the most progressive fisheries, we suggest a change in policy towards the management of small-scale fisheries. This change includes four major avenues of problem solving that focus on facilitating socio-ecological processes rather than primarily promoting a high level of quantitative science and implementing findings, technological concepts, or tools. Adoption is often culturally and context specific and, therefore, the above often have poor success when not socially integrated. We encourage facilitating and catalyzing local-level adoption of rules that create limits to appropriation and technology, since it is increasingly recognized that such limits are key solutions to the threats. This will be achieved if policy and actions (1) encourage professionalism (formation of societies, setting standards, certification, self-policing, appropriate technology, etc.), (2) create forums where all opinions about solutions, the status of targeted species, and environmental requirements are represented, (3) promote social rules that consider the realities and limits of the households and local social economy, and (4) craft solutions tailored to the specific and agreed upon diagnoses. We predict that as this socio-ecological process matures, it will also increase the inclusiveness of resource management goals to include non-use factors, such as biodiversity and other ecosystem services, which are still poorly evaluated and managed in even the most progressive small-scale fisheries.","[McClanahan, Timothy R.] Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, Bronx, NY USA; [Castilla, Juan Carlos] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Fac Ciencias Biol, Ctr Estudios Avanzados Ecol & Biodiversidad, Santiago, Chile; [White, Alan T.] Nature Conservancy, Global Marine Initiat, Honolulu, HI USA; [Defeo, Omar] UNDECIMAR, Fac Ciencias, Montevideo 11400, Uruguay; [Defeo, Omar] DINARA, Montevideo, Uruguay","Wildlife Conservation Society; Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile; Nature Conservancy; Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay","McClanahan, TR (corresponding author), Wildlife Conservat Soc, Marine Programs, Bronx, NY USA.",tmcclanahan@wcs.org; jcastill@bio.puc.cl; alan_white@tnc.org; odefeo@dinara.gub.uy,"Elias, Dereje/GPF-8075-2022; McClanahan, Tim/K-4998-2019","Defeo, Omar/0000-0001-8318-528X; McClanahan, Timothy/0000-0001-5821-3584",Centre for Advanced Studies in Ecology and Biodiversity (CASEB); FONDAP; PDT [S/C/OP/07/49]; Wildlife Conservation Society [UTF/URU/025/URU],Centre for Advanced Studies in Ecology and Biodiversity (CASEB); FONDAP; PDT; Wildlife Conservation Society,"We are grateful to the members of the Pew Charitable Trust and the Pew Fellows working group on community-based co-management of fisheries for the helpful discussions that led to this essay.

Coupled with a typology that contrasts corporate social responsibility and social economy Fair Trade models, this theoretical framework elucidates positions in the current policy debates about the minimum coffee price standard. Many Southern smallholders consider Fair Trade's standards, which for coffee include direct market accesses for smallholder cooperatives, minimum prices, and environmental criteria, among the best deals available. The smallholder empowerment benefits are often better than competing eco-labels. However, this study finds that Fair Trade minimum prices lost 41 percent of their real value from 1988 to 2008. Despite objections from several 'market driven' firms and national labelling initiatives, smallholders' collective advocacy and this research contributed to the Fairtrade Labelling Organisations International's (FLO) decision to mandate a 7-11 percent minimum price increase. The price debates demonstrate that Fair Trade governance is neither purely neoliberal nor social movement led-it is a highly contested socially embedded practice. Voices without votes, North-South inequalities, and dwindling prices paid to its stated protagonists indicate the need for governance reform, cost of living price adjustments, and additional investment in the innovative alternative trade and hybrid models.","[Bacon, Christopher M.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Bacon, CM (corresponding author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Geog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",christopher.bacon@berkeley.edu,"Bacon, Christopher Manes/JXN-5713-2024; Bacon, Christopher/AAD-8480-2019","Bacon, Christopher/0000-0002-2534-6900",,,,,114,126,151,5,193,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0306-6150,1743-9361,,J PEASANT STUD,J.

Since 1997, the third sector has received significant government support and has gradually moved from the economic periphery towards the centre such that it is now instrumental in the delivery of a range of government policies. It operates alongside both the private and public sectors in delivering employment, education, health and social care, housing and environmental policies. The impact of this has been seen in measures of social exclusion, poverty, the environment, social capital, as well as GDP and employment. Future policies should strive to maintain and develop the distinctive capabilities of third sector organisations and the balance between economic, social and environmental objectives.","Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England",University of Cambridge,"Haugh, H (corresponding author), Judge Business Sch, Trumpington St, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England.",h.haugh@jbs.cam.ac.uk; kitson@jbs.cam.ac.uk,"Haugh, Helen/AAF-6062-2020",,,,,,78,122,138,7,67,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This infection can be spread by asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic carriers. SARS-CoV-2 spreads primarily via respiratory droplets during close person-to-person contact in a closed space, especially a building. This article summarizes the environmental factors involved in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, including a strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a building environment. SARS-CoV-2 can persist on surfaces of fomites for at least 3 days depending on the conditions. If SARS-CoV-2 is aerosolized intentionally, it is stable for at least several hours. SARS-CoV-2 is inactivated rapidly on surfaces with sunlight. Close-contact aerosol transmission through smaller aerosolized particles is likely to be combined with respiratory droplets and contact transmission in a confined, crowded, and poorly ventilated indoor environment, as suggested by some cluster cases. Although evidence of the effect of aerosol transmission is limited and uncertainty remains, adequate preventive measures to control indoor environmental quality are required, based on a precautionary approach, because COVID-19 has caused serious global damages to public health, community, and the social economy. The expert panel for COVID-19 in Japan has focused on the 3 Cs, namely, closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowded spaces with many people, and close contact. In addition, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan has been recommending adequate ventilation in all closed spaces in accordance with the existing standards of the Law for Maintenance of Sanitation in Buildings as one of the initial political actions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. However, specific standards for indoor environmental quality control have not been recommended and many scientific uncertainties remain regarding the infection dynamics and mode of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in closed indoor spaces. Further research and evaluation are required regarding the effect and role of indoor environmental quality control, especially ventilation.","[Azuma, Kenichi] Kindai Univ, Fac Med, Dept Environm Med & Behav Sci, 377-2 Ohnohigashi, Osakasayama 5898511, Japan; [Yanagi, U.] Kogakuin Univ, Sch Architecture, Dept Architecture, Tokyo 1638677, Japan; [Kagi, Naoki] Tokyo Inst Technol, Sch Environm & Soc, Dept Architecture & Bldg Engn, Tokyo 1528550, Japan; [Kim, Hoon] Natl Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Environm Hlth, Wako, Saitama 3510197, Japan; [Ogata, Masayuki] Tokyo Metropolitan Univ, Dept Architecture & Bldg Engn, Tokyo 1920397, Japan; [Hayashi, Motoya] Hokkaido Univ, Fac Engn, Div Architecture, Lab Environm Space Design, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0606826, Japan",Kogakuin University; Tokyo Institute of Technology; National Institute of Public Health - Japan; Tokyo Metropolitan University; Hokkaido University,"Azuma, K (corresponding author), Kindai Univ, Fac Med, Dept Environm Med & Behav Sci, 377-2 Ohnohigashi, Osakasayama 5898511, Japan.",kenazuma@med.kindai.ac.jp,"Kagi, Naoki/AAA-2154-2021","Ogata, Masayuki/0000-0001-5811-9600; Kagi, Naoki/0000-0002-1466-8410; Azuma, Kenichi/0000-0002-6382-9807",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20H02309] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,113,121,131,7,60,JAPANESE SOC HYGIENE,Kyoto-city,"146 Nishioji-cho, Shimodachiuri-dori, Kamigyo-ku,, Kyoto-city, Kyoto, JAPAN",1342-078X,1347-4715,,ENVIRON HEALTH PREV,Environ.

Among all pollutants, fine particulate matters (PM2.5) directly related to various serious health concerns, e.g., lung cancer, premature death, asthma, and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. To enhance the quality of urban living, sensors are deployed to create smart cities. In this paper, we present a participatory urban sensing framework for PM2.5 monitoring with more than 2500 devices deployed in Taiwan and 29 other countries. It is one of the largest deployment project for PM2.5 monitor in the world as we know until May 2017. The key feature of the framework is its open system architecture, which is based on the principles of open hardware, open source software, and open data. To facilitate the deployment of the framework, we investigate the accuracy issue of low-cost particle sensors with a comprehensive set of comparison evaluations to identify the most reliable sensor. By working closely with government authorities, industry partners, and maker communities, we can construct an effective eco-system for participatory urban sensing of PM2.5 particles. Based on our deployment achievements to date, we provide a number of data services to improve environmental awareness, trigger on-demand responses, and assist future government policymaking. The proposed framework is highly scalable and sustainable with the potential to facilitate the Internet of Things, smart cities, and citizen science in the future.","[Chen, Ling-Jyh; Lee, Hu-Cheng; Liu, Hao-Min; Hsieh, Hsin-Hung; Huang, Yu-Te] Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan; [Ho, Yao-Hua; Wu, Hsuan-Cho] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Engn, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lung, Shih-Chun Candice] Acad Sinica, Res Ctr Environm Changes, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Taiwan Normal University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chen, LJ (corresponding author), Acad Sinica, Inst Informat Sci, Taipei, Taiwan.",cclljj@iis.sinica.edu.tw,"Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/GYD-5623-2022; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/ABA-1011-2020; Ho, Yao-Hua/AIA-3819-2022; Chen, Ling-Jyh/A-6311-2009","Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/0000-0002-4227-0469; Lung, Shih-Chun Candice/0000-0002-4227-0469; Ho, Yao-Hua/0000-0002-7993-525X; Chen, Ling-Jyh/0000-0001-5667-7764","Academia Sinica [MOST 105-2221-E-001-016-MY3, MOST 105-3011-F-001-002, MOST 106-3114-E-001-004, AS-104-SS-A02]; Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","Academia Sinica(Academia Sinica - Taiwan); Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","This work was supported in part by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan and in part by Academia Sinica under Grant MOST 105-2221-E-001-016-MY3, Grant MOST 105-3011-F-001-002, Grant MOST 106-3114-E-001-004, and Grant AS-104-SS-A02.",,31,121,127,4,50,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2017,5,,,,,,14441,14454,,10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723919,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2723919,,,14,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,FI2GW,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000411757800063,View Full Record in Web of Science

Wojciech",,,Beyond Nonprofits: Re-conceptualizing the Third Sector,VOLUNTAS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nonprofit organizations; Social economy; Civil society; Volunteer work; National accounts; Conceptualization; Definition,,"The idea of a third sector beyond the arenas of the state and the market is probably one of the most perplexing concepts in modern political and social discourse, encompassing as it does a tremendous diversity of institutions and behaviors that only relatively recently have been perceived in public or scholarly discourse as a distinct sector, and even then with grave misgivings. Initial work on this concept focused on what is still widely regarded as its institutional core, the vast array of private, nonprofit institutions (NPIs), and the volunteer as well as paid workers they mobilize and engage. These institutions share a crucial characteristic that makes it feasible to differentiate from for-profit enterprises: the fact that they are prohibited from distributing any surplus they generate to their investors, directors, or stakeholders and therefore presumptively serve some broader public interest. Many European scholars have considered this conceptualization too narrow; however, arguing that cooperatives, mutual societies, and, in recent years, social enterprises as well as social norms should also be included. However, this broader concept has remained under-conceptualized in reliable operational terms. This article corrects this short-coming and presents a consensus operational re-conceptualization of the third sector fashioned by a group of scholars working under the umbrella of the European Union's Third Sector Impact Project. This re-conceptualization goes well beyond the widely recognized definition of NPIs included in the UN Handbook on Nonprofit Institutions in the System of National Accounts by embracing as well some, but not all, of these additional institutions and forms of direct individual activity, and does so in a way that meets demanding criteria of comparability, operationalizability, and potential for integration into official statistical systems.","[Salamon, Lester M.; Sokolowski, S.

The deviation maximization method was extended to dynamic situation to calculate indicator weights with the purpose of widening the overall difference of the development of the cities. The results show that the coordinated development of the cities was not ideal. Eleven cities (accounting for 57.9%) showed primary and tiny coordination. Nine cities (accounting for 47.4%) presented a downward trend on the coupling coordination degree. The coordinated development of the other cities showed a small increase, with the maximum annual growth rate of 2.38%. The main reason for the low coordination is that the development of social economy was far behind that of ecological environment.

With regard to the Inuit, the aboriginal culture of Arctic Canada, research interest has focused principally on the vulnerability of the hunting and harvesting component of the traditional food system, otherwise frequently referred to as the subsistence system, if wild terrestrial and marine resources become less available. Although also concerned with the traditional Inuit food economy, this paper concentrates on the customary institutional mechanisms by which the Inuit distribute and share the products obtained from hunting. After analysing this social economy, a review of the data on recent climate-related range changes of a number of Arctic animal populations is carried out, in terms of how projected environmental changes may affect this other aspect of Inuit subsistence.

The development trends in the WECC during the years 2008-2020 were simulated and evaluated under different planning schemes. The results showed that the water ecological environment in the Siping area would develop into a poor carrying state in 2020 with a WECC index of 0.1819 if current social development modes remain unchanged. However, a good carrying state with a corresponding WECC index of 0.6652 could be achieved in 2020 if the 5th scheme is applied, which is an integrated planning scheme that combines changes in water-saving, pollution control, water resource exploitation and economic development. The results of this study could provide a scientific basis for the coordinated development of the social economy and the water eco-environment in the Siping area. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

It includes socio-economic subsystem, ecological subsystem and environment subsystem. X axis represents the level of ecological quality index; Y axis represents the level of environment quality index; Z-axis represents the level of socio-economic development index. The three-dimensional cube model divides into eight blocks of I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, which represent different social and economic development levels and the integrated status of ecological environmental quality. It covers 25 indicators of social economic development, ecological quality, and environmental quality. Entropy weighting method was adopted to determine the weight of each index. Ecological quality index, environmental quality index and socio-economic development index were divided into three grades; the subsystem index of grade II is taken as the inflection points Xip, Yip and Zip respectively. 11 prefecture-level cities in Jiangxi province in China were used as a study on carrying capacity evaluation for regional ecological environment to social economic development by the three-dimensional evaluation model. The comprehensive evaluation index and indexes of each subsystem were calculated. The actual ecological environmental quality and socio-economic values of the study area were compared with the corresponding indexes. The study shows that the environment subsystem has a great influence on the comprehensive model. The comprehensive evaluation index of 11 prefecture-level cities in Jiangxi province has exceeded the medium value (grade II). Jiujiang, Ganzhou, Yichun and Shangrao in Jiangxi province are in the model block VIII, other cities in Jiangxi province are in the model block V. It shows that all cities of Jiangxi province are still at the intermediate level of carrying capacity and are in the development stage of economic and environmental coordination. The three-dimensional model effectively reflects the actual situation of regional ecological environment, provides a way for other regional carrying capacity evaluation. It is feasible and scientific, and the results are more intuitive, spatial, and visual. The model provides a reference for the macro-management and decision making of ecological environment in the govemment sector.","[Wang, Jiayang; Wei, Xiaomei; Guo, Qian] Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Dept Resources & Environm, 24 Xuefu St, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Chengdu University of Information Technology,"Wang, JY (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Informat Technol, Dept Resources & Environm, 24 Xuefu St, Chengdu 610041, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",goodwjj@foxmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [11405113, 51209024]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 11405113, 51209024).",,26,106,111,12,153,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

They become more and more interconnected and interdependent with the development of scientific technology and social economy. Risk and vulnerability analysis of interdependent infrastructures for security considerations has become an important subject, and some achievements have been made in this area. Since different infrastructure systems have different structural and functional properties, there is no universal all-encompassing 'silver bullet solution' to the problem of analyzing the vulnerability associated with interdependent infrastructure systems. So a framework of analysis is required. This paper takes the power and water systems of a major city in China as an example and develops a framework for the analysis of the vulnerability of interdependent infrastructure systems. Four interface design strategies based on distance, betweenness, degree, and clustering coefficient are constructed. Then two types of vulnerability (long-term vulnerability and focused vulnerability) are illustrated and analyzed. Finally, a method for ranking critical components in interdependent infrastructures is given for protection purposes. It is concluded that the framework proposed here is useful for vulnerability analysis of interdependent systems and it will be helpful for the system owners to make better decisions on infrastructure design and protection.

In spite of the ageing population and the need for NPOs to expand their services, the participation of Canadian seniors in community volunteering has been stagnant for 15 years. What organisational and structural supports might encourage the expansion of volunteering among this group? How do current administrative conditions impact upon senior volunteers? What do older adults expect to gain from community volunteering? The qualitative data collected through interviews, documents and participant observation are analysed using an inter-disciplinary framework that combines theories of the moral economy of ageing, adult development and transformative learning. The results include a socio-demographic profile of senior volunteers in 12 Toronto NPOs, and the administrative characteristics of the six organisations that engage the majority. It is argued that the self-help and transformative mechanisms embedded in community volunteering provide opportunities for retirees to sustain their self-esteem and sense of wellbeing, while cultivating 'generativity' in late adulthood. Promoting transformative learning enables community volunteering to provide meaningful roles for seniors, and promotes citizenship participation and the social economy in an ageing society.","Univ Toronto, Asian Inst, Munk Ctr Int Studies, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada",University of Toronto,"Narushima, M (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Asian Inst, Munk Ctr Int Studies, 1 Devonshire Pl, Toronto, ON M5S 3K7, Canada.",miya.narushima@utoronto.ca,"Narushima, Miya/JYP-0819-2024",,,,,,45,106,129,3,37,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"40 WEST 20TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10011-4211 USA",0144-686X,,,AGEING SOC,Ageing Soc.,JUL,2005,25,,4,,,,567,584,,10.1017/S0144686X05003661,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0144686X05003661,,,18,Gerontology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Geriatrics & Gerontology,952MW,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000231009100006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Approximately 4.4 billion tons of bauxite residues are either stockpiled or landfilled, creating environmental risks either from the generation of dust or migration of filtrates. High alkalinity is the critical factor restricting complete utilization of bauxite residues, whilst the application of alkaline regulation agents is costly and difficult to apply widely. For now, current industrial wastes, such as waste acid, ammonia nitrogen wastewater, waste gypsum and biomass, have become major problems restricting the development of the social economy. Regulation of bauxite residues alkalinity by industrial waste was proposed to achieve waste control by waste' with good economic and ecological benefits. This review will focus on the origin and transformation of alkalinity in bauxite residues using typical industrial waste. It will propose key research directions with an emphasis on alkaline regulation by industrial waste, whilst also providing a scientific reference point for their potential use as amendments to enhance soil formation and establish vegetation on bauxite residue disposal areas (BRDAs) following large-scale disposal.","[Xue, Sheng-guo; Wu, Yu-jun; Li, Yi-wei; Kong, Xiang-feng; Zhu, Feng; Li, Xiao-fei; Ye, Yu-zhen] Cent S Univ, Sch Met & Environm, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China; [William, Hartley] Harper Adams Univ, Crop & Environm Sci Dept, Newport TF10 8NB, Shrops, England",Central South University; Harper Adams University,"Xue, SG (corresponding author), Cent S Univ, Sch Met & Environm, Changsha 410083, Hunan, Peoples R China.",sgxue70@hotmail.com,"di giorgio, paolo/AEP-7288-2022; Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022; 朱, 锋/IAO-5883-2023; Kong, Xiangfeng/T-2727-2018","朱, 锋/0000-0002-8468-183X; Kong, Xiangfeng/0000-0002-6132-0716; Hartley, William/0000-0001-9135-3984","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41877551, 41842020]; Environmental Protection's Special Scientific Research for Chinese Public Welfare Industry [201509048]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Environmental Protection's Special Scientific Research for Chinese Public Welfare Industry,"Foundation item: Projects(41877551, 41842020) supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China; Project(201509048) supported by the Environmental Protection's Special Scientific Research for Chinese Public Welfare Industry",,167,105,111,34,264,JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIV,HUNAN,"EDITORIAL OFF, CHANGSHA, CHINA MAINLAND, HUNAN 410083, PEOPLES R CHINA",2095-2899,2227-5223,,J CENT SOUTH UNIV,J.

A detailed discussion based on empirical data from the recycling network COOPCENT-ABC in metropolitan Sao Paulo, Brazil, contextualizes this form of urban mining. The analysis is situated within Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) and Ecological Economy (EE) theory. Current challenges related to planning, public policy, and the implementation of cooperative recycling are analysed on the level of individual recyclers, cooperatives, municipalities and internationally. There are still many hurdles for the informal, organized recycling sector to become recognized as a key player in efficient material separation and to up-scale these activities for an effective contribution to the SSE and EE. Policies need to be in place to guarantee fair and safe work relations. There is a win-win situation where communities and the environment will benefit from organized urban mining.

In part this is a result of the conceptual confusion surrounding the notion of social capital, but it also reflects a lack of empirical research. This article explores the notion of social capital and the manner in which it is produced, reproduced and used locally within the social economy as part of the local economic development process. Findings are presented from a transnational European research project which examined the development of social enterprises and the social economy within different localities in order to seek to better understand their interrelationships with the local production and use of social capital.

Climate and land use change are two important factors that affect water supply. Since the 1990s, China has implemented a series of land use policies, such as the grain-for-green program, which have significantly changed land use patterns. However, the effect of global climate change on water resources in China is growing, resulting in water shortages and deterioration of the aqueous environment. In this context, China's land use change, concurrent with the impacts of climate change on regional water resources, has become an issue worthy of discussion. This work analyzed the effect of land use and climate change on water yield in 1990 and 2010 using the Sancha River Basin as a case study. The variations in water yield in Sancha River Basin were simulated using the water-yield module in the InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs) model for three scenarios. The first scenario incorporated land use and climate change into the model in accordance with actual conditions. The second scenario was a simulation without climate change, and the third was without land use change. Water yield in Sancha River Basin increased by 17% between the two time periods in the actual scenario. In the scenario without climate change, land use conversions led to a 0.46% reduction in water yield. In the scenario without land use change, climate change led to a 17.50% increase in regional water yield due to precipitation. The impact of rainfall change on the Sancha River Basin water yield was as high as 97.44% while that of land use change was only 2.56%. This study shows that the grain-for-green program has negatively impacted water yield. Furthermore, to improve the ecological environment of the river basin, a comprehensive scheme for controlling water and soil erosion should be implemented according to the actual variation in water yield. This would give full consideration to the utility of water resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

While proponents hail these partnerships as an important new approach to engaging business, critics argue that they are not only generally ineffective but also serve to legitimate a neo-liberal, global economic order which inhibits development. In order to understand and evaluate the role of such partnerships, it is necessary to appreciate their diversity with respect to not only the activities that they engage in, but also the degree to which they are subject to social control. This paper distinguishes four different types of business partnerships, based upon differing degrees of social control: conventional business; corporate social responsibility; corporate accountability; and social economy. Each type of partnership is described, their basic forms are noted, and the conditions and prospects for them contributing to development are examined. By way of conclusion, an analysis is offered of how the different types of business partnerships relate to different conceptions of development and function as policy paradigms to promote different globalization agendas.","[Reed, Ananya Mukherjee] York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Reed, Darryl] York Univ, Div Social Sci, Business & Soc Program, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Reed, Ananya Mukherjee] Int Secretariat Human Dev, York, N Yorkshire, England",York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Reed, AM (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 6th Floor,S Ross Bldg,4700 Keele St, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",,"Reed, Darryl/HTN-5609-2023; Reed, Darryl W/I-1947-2012","Reed, Darryl W/0000-0002-9553-5205",,,,,137,97,117,2,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

J,"Chung, H; van Oorschot, W",,,,"Chung, Heejung; van Oorschot, Wim",,,Institutions versus market forces: Explaining the employment insecurity of European individuals during (the beginning of) the financial crisis,JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN SOCIAL POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,cross-European study; employment insecurity; flexicurity institutions; market forces; multi-level study; subjective perception,JOB INSECURITY; UNEMPLOYMENT; OECD,"In reaction to the recent financial crisis, the European Commission re-stated its view that the balance between flexibility and security is the key to success for the future of the European social economy, as well as its belief in the power of institutional arrangements it deems necessary for this balance. However, do powerful institutions actually counter market forces where flexicurity is concerned? In this paper we address this question by analysing the impact of institutional configurations and market factors on perceived employment insecurity among workers in Europe. We use the 4th wave of the European Social Survey for 2008/2009, which covers 22 countries, and implement a multi-level approach where contextual effects are taken into account and individuals are considered to be embedded within a country. We find that policies that secure one's income and employability skills, such as passive and active labour market policies, are more important for providing employment security for individuals than institutions that secure one's current job, such as employment protection. Of the economic and labour market factors, general market conditions (measured as employment rate average) and the strength of the financial crisis (measured as gross domestic product growth rate from 2008 to 2009) are both similarly influential in explaining cross-national variance in the employment insecurity perception of individuals. More generally, and most interestingly, we find that institutional factors lose their significance when market factors are taken into account. Thus, it seems that differences in economic and labour market conditions between countries better explain why workers feel insecure about their employment, than the differences in employment and income policies. Although this result could be influenced by the time period under investigation, which is characterized by a financial crisis, results from previous studies using data from different periods suggest that it is not period-specific.","[Chung, Heejung] Univ Kent, Sch Social Policy Sociol & Social Res, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England; [Chung, Heejung; van Oorschot, Wim] Tilburg Univ, Dept Sociol, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Kent; Tilburg University,"Chung, H (corresponding author), Univ Kent, Sch Social Policy Sociol & Social Res, Cornwallis Bldg, Canterbury CT2 7NF, Kent, England.",heejung77@gmail.com,"Chung, Heejung/P-4367-2014","Chung, Heejung/0000-0002-6422-6119",,,,,29,96,99,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0958-9287,1461-7269,,J EUR SOC POLICY,J.

Generally, during wastewater treatment, there are other pollutants including dyes and heavy metal ions in water apart from various kinds of oils. Therefore, how to remove these pollutants during the emulsion separation is of great significance. More recently, some membranes with underwater superoleophobic property have been ready to separate various oilin-water emulsions. However, the fabrication of majority of these superwetting membranes involves complicated process control, special equipment and expensive reagents, which further restricts the multifunction of practical large-scale applications. Herein, the three-dimensional attapulgite (APT) layer with sandwich-like architecture was fabricated by a facile and universal applicable approach without any further modification of the original membranes. This method employs ordinary material with underwater superoleophobicity towards the effective and fast separation of different oil-in-water emulsions and adsorption of organic dyes and heavy metal ions. Compared with the fabrication methods of traditional coatings, the design thought of this paper is universal and brand-new that can easily be applied to a broad range of materials. This work can provide more novel ideas for the fabrication of oil/water separating materials, leading to multifunctional water purification.","[Cui, Mengke; Mu, Peng; Zhu, Guorong; Luo, Lan; Li, Jian] Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Gansu Int Sci & Technol Cooperat Base Water Reten, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China; [Shen, Yongqian] Lanzhou Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Adv Proc & Recycling Nonferrous Met, Key Lab Nonferrous Met Alloys & Proc,Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R China",Northwest Normal University - China; Lanzhou University of Technology,"Li, J (corresponding author), Northwest Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Gansu Int Sci & Technol Cooperat Base Water Reten, Lanzhou 730070, Peoples R China.;Shen, YQ (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ Technol, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, State Key Lab Adv Proc & Recycling Nonferrous Met, Key Lab Nonferrous Met Alloys & Proc,Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730050, Peoples R China.",syqch@163.com; jianli83@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [51872245]; Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation of China [161044]; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Gansu Province, China [18JR3RA083]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018T110025, 2017M610031]; Yong Teacher Research Group Foundation of Northwest Normal University [NWNU-LKQN-16-6]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Gansu Province, China; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Yong Teacher Research Group Foundation of Northwest Normal University","This project was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 51872245), the Fok Ying-Tong Education Foundation of China (161044), the Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Gansu Province, China (18JR3RA083), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018T110025, 2017M610031), and the Yong Teacher Research Group Foundation of Northwest Normal University (NWNU-LKQN-16-6).",,59,91,95,13,338,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29a, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1383-5866,1873-3794,,SEP PURIF TECHNOL,Sep.

Societal developments have resulted in a greater use of many natural resources to the extent that the ecosystem can no longer self-regulate, thus severely damaging the balance of the ecosystem itself. This in turn has led to a deterioration in people's living environments. Our research is based on a combination of climate scenarios presented in the fifth report of the Intergovemmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and policy scenarios, including the one-child policy and carbon tax policy. We adopted Land Change Modeler of IDRISI software to simulate and analyze land-use change under 16 future scenarios in 2050. Carbon sequestration, soil conservation and water yields were quantified, based on those land-use maps and different ecosystem models. We also analyzed trade-offs and synergy among each ecosystem service and discussed why those interactions happened. The results show that: (1) Global climate change has a strong influence on future changes in land-use. (2) Carbon sequestration, water yield and soil conservation have a mutual relationship in the Guanzhong-Tianshui economic region. (3) Climate change and implementation of policy have a conspicuous impact on the changes in ecosystem services in the Guanzhong-Tianshui economic region.

The contribution of these social economy organizations to network development may relate, in part, to the process of regional clustering. In this study we explore the nature and significance of farmers' market clustering in the western Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta, focusing on the possible connection between clustering and a scaling up of alternative food networks. Survey and interview results from four regional clusters indicate that in addition to spatial agglomeration, dynamic processes of interaction and knowledge exchange are occurring and are shaped by vendor mobility as well as collaborative and competitive forces. Horizontal and vertical collaborations are resulting in innovative strategies to address challenges of scale, scope, infrastructure, and organizational capacity that are prevalent in alternative food networks. Government support for market clustering has been modest to date but, we argue, could play a more prominent role in facilitating cluster development as part of a broader collaborative strategy involving public, private, and social economy sectors in the scaling up of alternative food networks.","[Beckie, Mary A.] Univ Alberta, Fac Extens, Edmonton, AB T5J 4P6, Canada; [Kennedy, Emily Huddart] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada; [Wittman, Hannah] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta; Simon Fraser University,"Beckie, MA (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Fac Extens, Rm 2-383,Enterprise Sq,10230 Jasper Ave, Edmonton, AB T5J 4P6, Canada.",mary.beckie@ualberta.ca,"Wittman, Hannah/KCY-7697-2024","Wittman, Hannah/0000-0002-8247-6517; Huddart Kennedy, Emily/0000-0002-6723-4210",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We wish to acknowledge Chris Hergesheimer, Melisa Zapisocky, Paul Cabaj, and Herb Barbolet for their important contributions to this research and the editor and anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier drafts.

A distinction is made between essentialist and holistic definitions. The second section appraises the potential contribution of various current ideas in institutional economics and economic sociology to the definition of the social economy and its governance. It is found that `old' and `new' institutionalism in particular offer useful tools, including the holistic methodology as applied by John Commons. The third section elaborates on the analytical elements required for defining the social economy from a holistic perspective, stressing the role of essentialist abstract categories, the role of local culture and articulation between spatial scales. First, we show how the notion of social capital defined through a `holistic approach' can enrich the definition of the social economy. Secondly, we stress the importance of empirical investigations in feeding into the holistic definitional work. The fourth section concludes the paper by enhancing the necessary dialogue between an abstract-essentialist and a contextualised holistic definition of the social economy at the neighbourhood level.","Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, GURU, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; CNRS, IFRESI, F-75700 Paris, France; CNRS, IFRESI, CLERSE, F-59800 Lille, France",Newcastle University - UK; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Moulaert, F (corresponding author), Univ Newcastle Upon Tyne, GURU, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",Frank.Moulaert@ncl.ac.uk; Jacques.Nussbaumer@ifresi.univ-lillel.fr,,"Moulaert, Frank/0000-0001-8924-6928",,,,,47,88,98,2,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0042-0980,,,URBAN STUD,Urban Stud.,OCT,2005,42,11,,,,,2071,2088,,10.1080/420980500279752,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/420980500279752,,,18,Environmental Studies; Urban Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Urban Studies,972QA,,Green Submitted,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000232467100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some researchers have explored the behavior of inclined upward flame spread for its quick development and hazardous characteristics. However, for downward flame spread over plastic polymers, theirs flame spread characteristics can also feature a special hazardous configuration, especially for porous and thermoplastic polymers. In this study, the orientation effects during inclined downward flame spread processes were thoroughly investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. Two kinds of typical thermal insulation materials were selected, rigid polyurethane (RPU) and extruded polystyrene (XPS) foams. The mass flow rate and flame spread rate at different inclination angles were obtained and analyzed. The different flame spread behaviors of RPU and XPS foams were scrutinized. Experimental results show that a linear relationship exists between flame spread rate and cube root of sine of sample inclination angle of RPU and XPS foams when the slope is smaller than a transition angle. The mechanism of orientation effect during the flame spread process was qualitatively analyzed in detail, and simplified expressions of flame spread rate of the two insulation materials with different orientations were deduced.

Many would argue that this rapid growth has been due in large part to the increasing involvement of corporations. Still, participation by corporations in fair trade has not been welcomed by all. The basic point of contention is that, while corporate participation has the potential to rapidly extend the market for fair trade goods, it threatens key aspects of what many see as the original vision of fair trade - most notably a primary concern for the plight of small producers and the goal of developing an alternative approach to trade and development - and may even be undermining its long-term survival. The primary purpose of this article is to explore the non-native issues involved in corporate participation in fair trade. In order to do that, however, it first provides a positive analysis of how corporations are actually involved in fair trade. In order to achieve both of these ends, the article draws upon global value chain analysis.","York Univ, Div Social Sci, Business & Soc Program, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Reed, D (corresponding author), York Univ, Div Social Sci, Business & Soc Program, 7th Floor S Ross Bldg,4700 Keele Str, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",dreed@yorku.ca,"Reed, Darryl W/I-1947-2012; Reed, Darryl/HTN-5609-2023","Reed, Darryl W/0000-0002-9553-5205;",,,,,58,84,99,1,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

This article explores the potential for community transformation by bridging these two approaches - bringing more environmental considerations into the social economy and using the social economy to advance equity concerns within sustainability. We examine this potential through local food initiatives in two Canadian cities that are striving to create a synthesis of social and environmental objectives to achieve structural change in the way that food is produced, accessed and consumed. Both projects are founded on commitments to sustainable community development and social justice. While the initiatives illustrate the potential for community transformation by integrating sustainability and the social economy, they also illustrate the challenges associated with an incremental approach to change in the context of competition with mainstream economic activities that are heavily subsidized and do not account for negative social, economic and environmental externalities.","[Connelly, Sean; Markey, Sean; Roseland, Mark] Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Sustainable Community Dev, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University,"Connelly, S (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Ctr Sustainable Community Dev, 8888 Univ Dr, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",swconnel@sfu.ca,,"Connelly, Sean/0000-0002-6576-3856",,,,,25,80,105,1,49,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0261-0183,,,CRIT SOC POLICY,Crit.

Using a computer simulation of the SD model, the variation trends from 2006 to 2030 in population, economy, water supply and demand, and pressure on the water environment were derived for Beijing, from which 12 core variables of the model were chosen as the WRCC evaluation indices. Five cases were designed in this study. The results indicate that the WRCC will continue to decline annually by following the status quo (Case 1), since the water environment will have difficulty in supporting the long-term social and economic development of Beijing. The status quo of Beijing's socioeconomic development is therefore not sustainable. In order to address this problem, five optimization cases we're put forward to improve the WRCC, and the carrying capacities and trends of the cases were compared and analyzed. Under Case 5, the WRCC (0.8 in 2030) will increase by 50%, compared to that in Case 1 (0.4 in 2030), while the water supply and demand ratio will be 20% higher than the average, and the water pollution will be 35% lower than the average in 2030. According to the analysis results, in order to guarantee sustainable utilization of water resources and social economy development in Beijing, it is necessary to increase water saving policies and pollution control investment in the future. Corresponding measures will need to be taken to ensure the implementation of water saving strategies to improve the water environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A multidimensional measure of ethical culture was examined for its relationship to overall Person-Organization (P-O) fit and employee response, using a sample of 436 employees from social economy and commercial banks in Spain. In line with previous research involving unidimensional measures, ethical culture was found to relate positively to employee job satisfaction, affective commitment, and intention to stay. New to the literature, ethical culture was also found to be associated positively with employee willingness to recommend the organization to others. These effects were observed even when perceptions of P-O fit were controlled. Importantly, ethical culture was also positively related to overall P-O fit, which in turn, partially mediated the relationship between ethical culture and employee outcomes. Our findings add to studies that focus on the importance of the degree of ethical congruence between the individual employee and the organization. They suggest that ethical culture, with its expected impact on virtuousness and emotional well-being, will positively influence outcomes independently of the degree to which there is a match between employee and organizational values.","[Ruiz-Palomino, Pablo; Martinez-Canas, Ricardo] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Social Sci, Cuenca 16071, Spain; [Fontrodona, Joan] Univ Navarra, Business Eth Dept, Ctr Business Soc, IESE Business Sch, Barcelona 08034, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of Navarra; IESE Business School,"Ruiz-Palomino, P (corresponding author), Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Social Sci, Ave Alfares 44, Cuenca 16071, Spain.",pablo.ruiz@uclm.es; Ricardo.Martinez@uclm.es; JFontrodona@iese.edu,"Ruiz-Palomino, Pablo/D-4981-2012; Fontrodona, Joan/L-4563-2019; Martinez-Canas, Ricardo/G-3040-2010","Ruiz-Palomino, Pablo/0000-0002-0413-8512; Martinez-Canas, Ricardo/0000-0003-4629-5513",,,,,123,76,95,2,102,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

This article examines the potential of farmers' markets to play a catalyst role in linking local food systems to the social economy in western Canada. We used the Delphi method of inquiry to solicit and synthesize perspectives on the future role of farmers' markets within local food systems and the social economy from farmers' market vendors, market managers, and policy and government representatives in each province. We found that negotiations over the definition of local food systems, the dynamics of supply and demand relationships, and perceptions of authenticity affect the positionality of farmers' markets in relation to other marketing channels within regional food systems. Stakeholders engaged in this Delphi inquiry strategized ways to scale up local food systems beyond current limits while also maintaining the authentic experience offered by farmers' markets that has helped to fuel increased consumer interest, demand, and growth. Results confirm the need for further investigation of the relationship between the social economy, infrastructure, and authenticity in the development of local food systems.","[Wittman, Hannah; Hergesheimer, Chris] Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Beckie, Mary] Univ Alberta, Fac Extens, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",Simon Fraser University; University of Alberta,"Wittman, H (corresponding author), Simon Fraser Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",,"Wittman, Hannah/KCY-7697-2024","Wittman, Hannah/0000-0002-8247-6517",,,,,70,74,92,3,77,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-0112,1549-0831,,RURAL SOCIOL,Rural Sociol.,MAR,2012,77,1,,,,,36,61,,10.1111/j.1549-0831.2011.00068.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1549-0831.2011.00068.x,,,26,Sociology,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Sociology,901TJ,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000300989400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

It was an attempt to incorporate ecosystem service evaluation model within a general modeling framework in typical semi-arid region. The ecosystem service value was modified according to the development of eco-environment and social economy in Took Mu Qinqi based on the study of land ecosystem service value in China. The modified ecosystem service value provided input parameters for the optimization model. The results showed that the ecosystem service value of grassland was the highest among the six land-use categories, with about 97% and 83% of the total value for East and West Took Mu Qinqi, respectively. It indicated that grassland played an important role in ecosystem service. The results also showed that the total economic benefit produced by the optimal land use pattern increased by [11.5, 12.6], [5.66, 6.36] x 10(12) RMB (sic) compared with the current land-use pattern for East, West Took Mu Qinqi, respectively. The total ecosystem service value produced by the optimal land-use pattern also increased by [5.9, 9.1], [3.4, 4.5] x 10(12) RMB (sic) compared with that produced by the current land-use pattern for East, West Took Mu Qinqi, respectively. It indicated that the optimal land use pattern generated by the multi-objective model was better than the current land-use pattern either from the point of economic benefit or from the point of ecological benefit. The optimization model of land-use structure based on ecosystem service value could satisfy the social, economical, and environmental development, which provided a new way to solve the key technical problem in land-use planning in typical semi-arid region.

It begins by relating the social enterprise idea to major non-state/non-private institutional traditions, including the European social economy, US non-profits and the UK charitable sector, and places it within the specific field of economic and social welfare. In so doing, the article contests the idea that social enterprise is a new phenomenon in the social welfare field and proposes instead that the supposed 'novelty' of social enterprise as an organizational form and a subject of public policy lies primarily in the nature of the socio-political and economic context of the 1980s-1990s, during which time it became 'en vogue'. The process of institutionalization of social enterprise and its ascension into the mainstream policy arena is examined in more detail in the case of England during the time New Labour was in office and beyond, and lessons are drawn from this experience concerning both the role that social enterprise plays or is expected to play as a vehicle to address economic and social needs, and how this is intertwined with both a dominant neo-liberal discourse, as well as alternative perspectives that emphasize more equalitarian and sustainable development paths. The article concludes with some reflections in relation to the apparent consensus that seems to exist around social enterprise as a legitimate subject of public policy and the resulting social enterprization of public services which is currently taking place in England.","[Sepulveda, Leandro] Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London N17 8HR, England",Middlesex University,"Sepulveda, L (corresponding author), Middlesex Univ, Sch Business, London N17 8HR, England.",l.sepulveda@mdx.ac.uk,,,Third Sector Research Centre; UK Economic and Social Research Council; Office for Civil Society; Barrow Cadbury UK Trust,Third Sector Research Centre; UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Office for Civil Society; Barrow Cadbury UK Trust,"The author would like to acknowledge the financial support from the Third Sector Research Centre, the UK Economic and Social Research Council, the Office for Civil Society and the Barrow Cadbury UK Trust.

Since China's reform and opening up, major changes have taken place in the country's social economy and cultivated land use. Based on statistical data analysis and literature review, this study systematically reviewed long-term changes in cultivated land use in China. On that basis, future trends are identified, which can provide new insights for future research on cultivated land use and protection management. The findings indicate that while cultivated land use is diversified, smallholder farmers still account for the main part. Further, the scale of cultivation is expanding but still fragmented, profits derived from land cultivation are slowly growing, and the proportion of those profits in total household income has dramatically declined. It was also found that the social security function of cultivated land has been weakened, cultivated land management has become more diversified, and grain output has risen steadily. To meet the needs of social and economic development, the government should promote the transfer of the household as a unit instead of labor. Moreover, innovation in the land use system should be stimulated based on industrial convergence, and policy incentives for ecological farming should be increased.","[Lai, Zhaohao; Chen, Meiqiu; Liu, Taoju] Jiangxi Agr Univ, Res Ctr Rural Land Resources Use & Protect, 1101 Zhiming Rd, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Lai, Zhaohao; Chen, Meiqiu] Key Lab Poyang Lake Basin Agr Resources & Ecol, 1101 Zhiming Rd, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi Agricultural University,"Chen, MQ (corresponding author), Jiangxi Agr Univ, Res Ctr Rural Land Resources Use & Protect, 1101 Zhiming Rd, Nanchang 330045, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",cmq12@263.net,"Lai, Zhaohao/AAR-9325-2020","Lai, Zhaohao/0000-0003-1344-6194",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71964016]; Ganpo Talent 555 Project of Jiangxi Province; Innovation Team of Farmers' Behavior and the Utilization/Protection of Agricultural Resources; Collaborative Innovation Center of Sustainable Development Decision Support for Modern Agriculture and its Advantage Industries in Jiangxi Province,National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ganpo Talent 555 Project of Jiangxi Province; Innovation Team of Farmers' Behavior and the Utilization/Protection of Agricultural Resources; Collaborative Innovation Center of Sustainable Development Decision Support for Modern Agriculture and its Advantage Industries in Jiangxi Province,"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 71964016), the Ganpo Talent 555 Project of Jiangxi Province, the Innovation Team of Farmers' Behavior and the Utilization/Protection of Agricultural Resources, and the Collaborative Innovation Center of Sustainable Development Decision Support for Modern Agriculture and its Advantage Industries in Jiangxi Province.

Scholars from a variety of disciplines have analysed drivers of illegal hunting and poaching behaviour in general terms. Existing scholarship on rhino poaching proffers a simplistic concurrence of interlinked drivers, including the entry of transnational organized crime into wildlife crime, opportunity structures and the endemic poverty facing people living close to protected areas. By engaging with the lived experiences and social worlds of poachers and rural communities, this article reflects on empirical evidence gathered during ethnographic fieldwork with poachers, prisoners and local people living near the Kruger National Park. It is argued that the socio-political and historical context and continued marginalization of local people are significant factors facilitating poaching decisions at the grassroots level. Green land grabs and the systematic exclusion of local people from protected areas, as well as the growing securitization of anti-poaching responses, are aiding the perception that the wild animal is valued more highly than black rural lives. As a consequence, conservationists and law enforcers are viewed with disdain and struggle to obtain cooperation. The article critiques the current fortress conservation paradigm, which assumes conflict-laden relationships between local people and wildlife.","[Huebschle, Annette M.] Univ Cape Town, Environm Secur Observ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Hübschle, AM (corresponding author), Univ Cape Town, Environm Secur Observ, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",annette.hubschle@uct.ac.za,"Hubschle, Annette/A-5350-2017","Hubschle, Annette/0000-0002-7566-7067",Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies,Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies,This research was funded by the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies.,,73,70,75,7,102,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0011-3921,1461-7064,,CURR SOCIOL,Curr.

In this approach, other forms of business organization, particularly SE enterprises, become a priority for analysis, opening up new scientific, social and economic vistas.","[Chaves, Rafael; Monzon, Jose Luis] Univ Valencia, Res Inst Social & Cooperat Econ IUDESCOOP, Fac Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Chaves, Rafael; Monzon, Jose Luis] CIRIEC Espana, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia,"Chaves, R (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Res Inst Social & Cooperat Econ IUDESCOOP, Fac Econ, Avda Dels Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Rafael.Chaves@uv.es; ciriec@uv.es,"Chaves, Rafael/F-1967-2016","Chaves, Rafael/0000-0003-4087-1284; Monzon Campos, Jose Luis/0000-0001-7304-4096",,,,,62,70,75,0,37,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1862-8516,1862-8508,,SERV BUS,Serv.

Specifically, nitrogen pollution has become highly problematic in water management. To identify nitrogen pollution and its sources in the Weihe River, northwest China, concentrations of different forms of nitrogen, and delta N-15 and delta O-18 compositions were analyzed. The mean nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and nitrite nitrogen (NO2--N) concentrations were 4.70, 0.34 and 0.09 mg L-1, respectively, indicating that nitrate was the dominant form of nitrogen pollution. The middle and lower reaches of the Weihe River suffered more severe nitrogen pollution problems than the upper reaches. The stable isotope and Bayesian model revealed that manure, domestic sewage and industrial wastewater discharge constituted the main sources of NO3--N pollution, with the contribution of 71.3% of the three sources. The redundancy analysis (RDA) showed a positive correlation between population, industrial wastewater, domestic sewage, livestock and nitrogen pollution concentrations. Forestlands and grasslands had negative effects on surface water nitrogen concentrations, with a total reduction effect of 55.8%. To improve the surface water quality in the Weihe River, it is recommended to increase sewage treatment, improve livestock manure utilization and refine the land-use structure of the watershed.","[Shi, Peng; Li, Peng; Li, Zhanbin; Qin, Yanli] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Ecohydraul Northwest Arid Reg China, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yan; Song, Jinxi; Bi, Zhilei; Zhang, Xin] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Shi, Peng; Li, Peng; Li, Zhanbin] Key Lab Natl Forestry Adm Ecol Hydrol & Disaster, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yongsheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoming] China Inst Water Resources & Hydropower Res, Dept Sediment Res, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Tiantian] Xian Univ Architecture & Technol, Coll Architecture, Xian 710055, Shaanxi, Peoples R China","Xi'an University of Technology; Northwest University Xi'an; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; China Institute of Water Resources & Hydropower Research; Xi'an University of Architecture & Technology","Song, JX (corresponding author), Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jinxisong@nwu.edu.cn,"Shi, Peng/F-2973-2016; Li, Peng/K-4442-2016; Zhang, Kai/KBD-3312-2024; Song, Jinxi/AAF-6060-2020","Li, Peng/0000-0003-1795-6466; Song, Jinxi/0000-0001-9838-8063","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0504704]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601092, 41601017]; Young Talent Fund of University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China [20190702]; Shaanxi Provincial Technology Innovation Guidance Project [2017CGZH-HJ-06]; Shaanxi Province Innovation Talent Promotion Project Technology Innovation Team [2018TD-037]; Program for Key Science and Technology Innovation Team in Shaanxi Province [2014 KCT-27]; Research Funds of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin [SKL 2018 CG04]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Young Talent Fund of University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China; Shaanxi Provincial Technology Innovation Guidance Project; Shaanxi Province Innovation Talent Promotion Project Technology Innovation Team; Program for Key Science and Technology Innovation Team in Shaanxi Province; Research Funds of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant 2017YFC0504704), National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 41601092, 41601017), Young Talent Fund of University Association for Science and Technology in Shaanxi, China (Grant 20190702), Shaanxi Provincial Technology Innovation Guidance Project (Grant 2017CGZH-HJ-06), the Shaanxi Province Innovation Talent Promotion Project Technology Innovation Team (Grant 2018TD-037), Program for Key Science and Technology Innovation Team in Shaanxi Province (Grant 2014 KCT-27) and the Research Funds of State Key Laboratory of Simulation and Regulation of Water Cycle in River Basin (Grant SKL 2018 CG04).",,42,68,70,15,149,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-6707,2210-6715,,SUSTAIN CITIES SOC,Sust.

The smart home control system uses a smart central controller to set up a radio frequency 433 MHz wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN). A series of control modules, such as switch modules, radio frequency control modules, have been developed in the WSAN to control directly all kinds of home appliances. Application servers, client computers, tablets or smart phones can communicate with the smart central controller through a wireless router via a Wi-Fi interface. Since it has WSAN as the lower control layer, a appliance can be added into or withdrawn from the control system very easily. The smart control system embraces the functions of appliance monitor, control and management, home security, energy statistics and analysis.","[Wang, Ming; Zhang, Chenghui] Shandong Univ, Sch Control Sci & Engn, Jinan 250061, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Ming; Zhang, Guiqing; Li, Chengdong] Shandong Jianzhu Univ, Sch Informat & Elect Engn, Jinan 250101, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jianbin] ShenZhen Soben Skysafe Hitech Dev Co Ltd, Shenzhen 518033, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Shandong Jianzhu University,"Wang, M (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Sch Control Sci & Engn, Jinan 250061, Shandong, Peoples R China.",xclwm@sdjzu.edu.cn,"zhang, jian/HPD-1712-2023",,"NSFC [61273326, 61074149, 61105077]; Science and Technology Development Program of Higher Education of Shandong Province [J11LG16]; Science and Technology Development Program of Shandong Province of China [2012GGX10120]; Excellent Young and Middle-Aged Scientist Award Grant of Shandong Province of China [BS2012DX026]; Science and Technology Programm of Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China [2011-K1-18]; Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of Shandong Province [2011YK022]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2012M521337]; Shandong Jianzhu University Doctoral Foundation [XNBS1018]; State Key Laboratory Program of Management and Control for Complex Systems",NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Development Program of Higher Education of Shandong Province; Science and Technology Development Program of Shandong Province of China; Excellent Young and Middle-Aged Scientist Award Grant of Shandong Province of China; Science and Technology Programm of Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China; Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of Shandong Province; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Shandong Jianzhu University Doctoral Foundation; State Key Laboratory Program of Management and Control for Complex Systems,"This work is partially supported by NSFC Grants (61273326, 61074149, 61105077), the Science and Technology Development Program of Higher Education of Shandong Province (J11LG16), Science and Technology Development Program of Shandong Province of China (2012GGX10120), the Excellent Young and Middle-Aged Scientist Award Grant of Shandong Province of China (BS2012DX026), the Science and Technology Programm of Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of China (2011-K1-18), the program of Department of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of Shandong Province (2011YK022), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(2012M521337), the Shandong Jianzhu University Doctoral Foundation(XNBS1018), the State Key Laboratory Program of Management and Control for Complex Systems.",,12,68,75,0,15,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",,,978-1-4673-6249-8; 978-1-4673-6248-1,,,,2013,,,,,,,744,747,,,,,,4,"Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Automation & Control Systems; Computer Science; Engineering,BHQ49,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000326374300144,View Full Record in Web of Science

The pathogenesis of OA is complex and unclear, and there is no effective way to block its progress. The study of the pathogenesis of OA is the prerequisite for the early diagnosis and effective treatment of OA. To define the pathogenesis of OA, this review considers the pathological mechanism of OA that involves microRNA, lncRNA, and exosomes. More and more evidence shows that microRNA, lncRNA, and exosomes are closely related to OA. MicroRNA inhibits the target gene by binding to the 3 '- untranslated region of the targets. LncRNA usually competes with microRNA to regulate the expression level of downstream genes, while exosomes, as a carrier of intercellular information transfer, transmit the biological information of mother cells to target cells, and the effect of exosomes secreted by different cells on OA are different. In this review, we emphasized that different microRNA, lncRNA, and exosomes have different regulatory effects on chondrocyte proliferation and apoptosis, extracellular matrix degradation and inflammation. Besides, we classified and analyzed these molecules according to their effects on the progress of OA. Based on the analysis of the reported literature, this review reveals some pathogenesis of OA, and emphasizes that microRNA, lncRNA, and exosomes have great potential to assist early diagnosis and effective treatment of OA.","[Xie, Fang; Liu, Yong-li; Chen, Xiu-yuan; Li, Qian; Zhong, Jia; Dai, Bin-yu; Shao, Xian-fang] Hunan Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Changde Hosp, 588 Binhu Rd, Changde 415000, Peoples R China; [Wu, Guan-bao] Hunan Acad Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, 58 Lushan Rd, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China",Hunan University of Chinese Medicine,"Shao, XF (corresponding author), Hunan Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Changde Hosp, 588 Binhu Rd, Changde 415000, Peoples R China.;Wu, GB (corresponding author), Hunan Acad Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, 58 Lushan Rd, Changsha 410006, Peoples R China.",13973657615@139.com; yhywgb@126.com,,"Xie, Fang/0000-0002-0039-8747",National Natural Science Foundation of China [81874476]; Hunan Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine [201902]; Changde Science and Technology Bureau [2012SK06],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Hunan Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Changde Science and Technology Bureau,"The research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number: 81874476), Hunan Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Grant Number: 201902), and Changde Science and Technology Bureau (Grant Number: 2012SK06).",,111,67,73,3,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1757-7853,1757-7861,,ORTHOP SURG,Orthop.

Although the proportion of disabled people in 'mainstream' employment has increased in recent decades, rates remain significantly below those for non-disabled people. Moreover, disabled workers continue to face discrimination and a lack of workplace accommodation. This paper critically examines the potential of three alternatives to the current situation. First, how might stronger ties between disabled workers and the labour movement allow for greater control over the nature of mainstream work? Second, can more enabling work opportunities be created beyond the 'mainstream' in social economy organizations?

The research highlights the capacity of social entrepreneurs to empower local communities through a process of collective mobilization of local resources. Theoretically, this study generates new insights into the nature and meanings of resilience as a process of creation of more self-reliant communities of people, places, tools, skills and knowledge.

Silicon (Si), being an important fertilizer element, has been found effective in enhancing plant tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses. The present study investigated the extent to which different levels of Si modulated the Cd tolerance of Ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi L.) seedlings when maintained in artificially Cd spiked regimes. A pot experiment was conducted under controlled conditions for four weeks, by using sand, mixed with different levels of Cd i.e., 0, 1.5 and 3 mM together with the application of Si at 0, 1.5 and 3 mM levels to monitor different growth, gaseous exchange, oxidative stress, antioxidative responses, minerals accumulation, organic acid exudation patterns of T. ammi seedlings. Our results depicted that Cd addition to growth medium significantly decreased plant growth and biomass, gaseous exchange attributes and minerals uptake by T. ammi seedlings as compared to the plants grown without addition of Cd. However, Cd toxicity boosted the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increasing the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), which is the indication of oxidative stress in T. ammi seedlings and was also manifested by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents and electrolyte leakage to the membrane bounded organelles. Although, activities of various antioxidative enzymes like superoxidase dismutase (SOD), pemxidase (POD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) initially increased up to a Cd level of 1.5 mM but were significantly diminished at the highest Cd level of 3 mM. Results revealed that the anthocyanin and soluble proteins contents were decreased in seedlings grown under elevating Cd levels but increased the Cd accumulation of T. ammi roots and shoots. The negative impacts of Cd injury were reduced by the application of Si which increased plant growth and biomass, improved photosynthetic apparatus, antioxidant enzymes, minerals uptake together with diminished exudation of organic acids as well as oxidative stress indicators in mots and shoots of T. ammi by decreasing Cd retention in different plant parts. Research findings, therefore, suggested that Si application can ameliorate Cd toxicity in T. ammi seedlings and resulted in improved plant growth and composition under metal stress as depicted by balanced exudation of organic acids.","[Javed, Muhammad Tariq; Iqbal, Naeem; Begum, Ruqiyya] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Bot, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Saleem, Muhammad Hamzah] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, MOA Key Lab Crop Ecophysiol & Farming Syst Middle, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [Aslam, Sidra] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Bioinformat & Biotechnol, Allama Iqbal Rd, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Rehman, Muzammal] Yunnan Univ, Sch Agr, Kunming 650504, Peoples R China; [Ali, Shafaqat] Govt Coll Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Allama Iqbal Rd, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan; [Ali, Shafaqat] China Med Univ, Dept Biol Sci & Technol, Taichung 40402, Taiwan; [Alsahli, Abdulaziz Abdullah; Alyemeni, Mohammed Nasser; Wijaya, Leonard] King Saud Univ, Coll Sci, Dept Bot & Microbiol, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia",Government College University Faisalabad; Government College University Faisalabad; Yunnan University; Government College University Faisalabad; China Medical University Taiwan; King Saud University,"Saleem, MH (corresponding author), Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Plant Sci & Technol, MOA Key Lab Crop Ecophysiol & Farming Syst Middle, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.;Ali, S (corresponding author), Govt Coll Univ, Dept Environm Sci & Engn, Allama Iqbal Rd, Faisalabad 38000, Pakistan.",saleemhamza312@webmail.hzau.edu.cn; shafaqataligill@gcuf.edu.pk,"Hamzah Saleem, Muhammad/AAD-5391-2020; wu, wenhui/IXX-0116-2023; Wijaya, Leonard/AAF-4724-2021","Hamzah Saleem, Muhammad/0000-0002-3658-770X; Wijaya, Leonard/0000-0003-0504-5040; Aslam, sidra/0000-0002-2179-4976; Ali, Shafaqat/0000-0002-3773-5196","Higher Education Commission of Pakistan; king saud university, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [RSP-2020/180]","Higher Education Commission of Pakistan(Higher Education Commission of Pakistan); king saud university, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(King Saud University)","We gratefully acknowledge Higher Education Commission of Pakistan for providing financial assistance.

In this paper, a comprehensive index system was built to estimate the coupling coordination between social economy and water environmental quality subsystems in Nansi Lake catchment, China. Improved coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, scissors difference and projection pursuit model based on genetic algorithm were developed to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamic evolution mechanism of coupling coordination in social economy-water environment system. Results showed that: (1) Comprehensive level of two subsystems showed an overall uptrend, water environmental quality in the catchment was improved gradually with socio-economic development. (2) The status of coupling coordination between two subsystems had transformed from moderately unbalanced development (CCD of 0.265 in 2001) to favorably balanced development (CCD of 0.667 in 2017). The relatively low CCD in Heze generated the biggest restriction on the coordinated development between two subsystems, compared to Zaozhuang and Jining. (3) The speed difference between two subsystems showed a downward trend, the scissor difference was controlled effectively. And the social economy-water environmental quality system gradually tended to the coordinated development. Overall, the improved CCD model and scissors difference analysis in this paper may provide a new approach for empirical research on environment-economy nexus. We hope this study can help decision makers formulate measures to promote the coordinated development between social economy and water environmental quality subsystems.","[Liu, Yi; Yang, Liyuan; Jiang, Wei] Univ Jinan, Sch Water Conservancy & Environm, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China",University of Jinan,"Yang, LY (corresponding author), Univ Jinan, Sch Water Conservancy & Environm, Jinan 250022, Peoples R China.",stu_yangly@ujn.edu.cn,"Liyuan, yang/R-3446-2019",,Shandong Province Key Research and Development Plan (Public Welfare Project) [2019GSF110016],Shandong Province Key Research and Development Plan (Public Welfare Project),This work was supported by the Shandong Province Key Research and Development Plan (Public Welfare Project) (2019GSF110016).,,58,65,69,26,163,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

There are, however, multiple geographies of cultural production, with other cultural activities deconcentrated and, in some cases, dispersed to distant locations. This situation poses an enigma, since these activities normally form part of a social economy in which networks of personal communication remain important. This paradox is explored using the case of the comic book industry, which has shifted from an in-house Fordist-like mode of organization to widespread distancing employing neoartisanal workers who are sometimes located close to the publishing houses, but in other instances are at considerable distances and hence require electronic communication and overnight courier services. Comic book artists often work in isolation but participate from time to time in social activities that are necessary to their creative work. Their work is seen as one of a number of cultural activities that form a periodic social economy with a distinctive time geography.","York Univ, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada,"Norcliffe, G (corresponding author), York Univ, Dept Geog, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",,,,,,,,63,65,77,0,33,ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY,WORCESTER,"CLARK UNIV, WORCESTER, MA 01610 USA",0013-0095,,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

To better adapt to the environment and solve practical decision-making problems, this study uses the probabilistic linguistic terms set (PLTS) to describe qualitative information, which can not only provide every possible evaluation value, but can also yield the weight or proportion of these values. Based on the PLTS, we propose a probabilistic linguistic-dependent weighted average (PLDWA) operator; then, we establish the prospect theory-based multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis plus the full multiplicative form (MULTIMOORA) method (PT-MULTIMOORA) and extend it to the probabilistic linguistic information (PLI) environment. Moreover, we propose a final value determination method for the PT-MULTIMOORA method. Based on the combination of the PLDWA operator and the PT-MULTIMOORA method, we develop a novel approach to solve multiple criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problems with PLI. Two practical cases are demonstrated to verify the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method.","[Liu, Peide; Li, Ying] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University of Finance & Economics,"Liu, PD (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China.",Peide.liu@gmail.com,"liu, peng/JSL-1931-2023; liu, peide/D-3392-2013","liu, peide/0000-0001-5048-8145","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71771140, 71471172]; Special Funds of Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province [ts201511045]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Funds of Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province,"This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71771140 and 71471172), the Special Funds of Taishan Scholars Project of Shandong Province (No. ts201511045).",,62,64,66,4,78,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0360-8352,1879-0550,,COMPUT IND ENG,Comput.

The long road towards a social economy in agriculture,JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Agricultural cooperatives; Social cooperatives; Community cooperatives; Alternative food networks; Social economy; Italy,RURAL-DEVELOPMENT; MOVEMENT; EMBEDDEDNESS; PERSPECTIVE; STRATEGIES; COMMUNITY; SYSTEMS,"In the context of a special issue of the Journal of Rural Studies on more-than-economic motivations for farmers' cooperation, this article aims to analyse the tensions and contending views of the cooperative movement in Italy with special attention to the agricultural sector and to the emergence of the new model of social cooperatives in the last decades of the 20th century. We interpret this emergence and its codification in law as the decoupling of more-than-economic motivations of cooperation from the mainstream Italian cooperative sector and their reinstatement in a new, but separate model of social cooperation more closely linked to community- and solidarity-oriented initiatives. The presence of institutional tensions and frictions hints at the fact that cooperatives have a multi faced nature expressed in the not always easy co-existence of a cooperative economy and a cooperative movement. After the II World War, as Italian cooperatives in general and particularly agricultural cooperatives moved towards a productivist model and a 'competitive market' paradigm, the more-than economic aspects have continued to inspire movements for social and community economies. In the 1990s the social economy project was appropriated but somehow 'sanitized' by the cooperative movement through the legally sanctioned establishment of social cooperatives and their confinement to specific sections within national cooperative federations. Later on, while the emergence of social cooperatives has had little influence on the functioning and orientation of traditional agricultural cooperatives and federations, the reinstatement of a social function for agriculture has taken place at the much more fluid interface between social cooperation, on the one hand, and civic agriculture movements rooted in alternative food networks and community-oriented initiatives, on the other. It is only recently that the cooperative movement has tried catch up with the new paradigms of alternative agriculture and rural development through the experimentation at regional level of the cooperative di comunita (community cooperatives), that operate to re-affirm the role of multifunctional and multi-stakeholder cooperatives in rural/territorial development.

Globally, the language of a green economy is being promoted as a means to develop a 'win-win' for the economy and the environment. There are concerns, however, that the emerging frameworks for sustainable economic renewal marginalize social dimensions of sustainability and the already existing practices of sustainability innovation within the social economy. Using empirical evidence from Ireland, this article examines the dimensions of this marginalisation by interrogating the dynamic landscape of environmentally focused social economy enterprises as additional spaces of sustainability innovation for a greener economy. It is found that while these enterprises can be cast as spaces of actually existing sustainable development tensions persist which together raise general questions about measuring and communicating sustainability as well as more foundational issues relating to permissible forms of sustainable economic renewal.","[Davies, Anna R.; Mullin, Sue J.] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Davies, AR (corresponding author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dept Geog, Dublin, Ireland.",daviesa@tcd.ie,"Siddall, Emma/F-3812-2014; Hallstedt, Sophie I./A-4669-2015; Davies, Anna/AAB-4254-2020","Siddall, Emma/0000-0002-3045-8552;",,,,,78,63,64,4,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

In recent years, China's social economy has undergone dramatic transformation, and the land use pattern of rural settlements has also significantly changed. Against this background, it is important to reveal the evolution rules of rural settlements to provide references for rural settlement rearrangement. Based on interpreting high-precision military satellite remote sensing images, we selected Tongzhou District of Beijing as a case to discuss the evolution process of rural settlements during 1961-2015. Tongzhou has a history of rural settlement construction for more than 2000 years and will face rapid changes in rural settlement patterns due to the new urbanization policies. The land transformation model (LTM) was employed to simulate the spatial expansion of rural settlements in 2030. The results showed that the number of rural settlement sites in Tongzhou continuously decreased during the past 50 years, with a total decrease by 43.30 %, whereas the total area continuously increased during 1961-2015 (146.64 %). The spatial pattern of the rural settlements was regularized continuously, but the spatial distribution of density varied in different stages. In total, spatial density first presented a decreasing trend, followed by an increase. For over 50 years, there were mainly four evolution modes for the spatial distribution of rural settlements in Tongzhou, namely the extinction, the diffusion, the infilling, and the merging mode. The simulation results obtained by the LTM showed that the rural settlements of Tongzhou all expanded, albeit to varying degrees, and that their expansion mostly followed the diffusion mode, based on the existing rural settlement sites.","[Song, Wei; Li, Huanhuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Huanhuan] Luoyang Normal Univ, Sch Land & Tourism, Luoyang 471000, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Luoyang Normal University","Song, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",songw@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Song, Wei/E-8333-2018","Song, Wei/0000-0003-4039-2339","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671177]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0603]; Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602402, 2018YFC1508801]; Project from the Development Research Center of State Administration for Market Regulation, China","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research; Key Research and Development Program of China; Project from the Development Research Center of State Administration for Market Regulation, China","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41671177), The Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (Grant No. 2019QZKK0603), the Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2016YFA0602402 and 2018YFC1508801) and the Project from the Development Research Center of State Administration for Market Regulation, China (entitled Research on the analysis framework on quality safety situation).",,80,62,66,34,159,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0264-8377,1873-5754,,LAND USE POLICY,Land Use Pol.,DEC,2020,99,,,,,,,,105044,10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105044,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2020.105044,,,14,Environmental Studies,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology,OY8KB,,hybrid,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000594488900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Remote sensing technology has provided an effective way to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of inundation. Remotely sensed images with high temporal resolutions are widely used in mapping inundation. However, mixed pixels do exist due to their relatively low spatial resolutions. One of the most popular approaches to resolve this issue is sub-pixel mapping. In this paper, a novel discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) based sub-pixel flood inundation mapping (DPSO-SFIM) method is proposed to achieve an improved accuracy in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale. The evaluation criterion for sub-pixel inundation mapping is formulated. The DPSO-SFIM algorithm is developed, including particle discrete encoding, fitness function designing and swarm search strategy. The accuracy of DPSO-SFIM in mapping inundation at a sub-pixel scale was evaluated using Landsat ETM + images from study areas in Australia and China. The results show that DPSO-SFIM consistently outperformed the four traditional SEIM methods in these study areas. A sensitivity analysis of DPSO-SFIM was also carried out to evaluate its performances. It is hoped that the results of this study will enhance the application of medium-low spatial resolution images in inundation detection and mapping, and thereby support the ecological and environmental studies of river basins.

In this paper, superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic polypropylene (PP) melt-blown membranes were prepared through melt-blown and in situ growth method, achieving highly efficient oil/water separation. After in situ growth, polydopamine (PDA) grows on the surface of PP fibers, and the addition of coupling agent (3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APTES) can improve the stability of the membrane in harsh environments (1 M HCl, 1 M NaOH, 1 M NaCl). The PDA/APTES@PP membrane could dramatically enhance the wetting (water contact angle similar to 0, underwater oil contact angle similar to 154 degrees) compare with the pristine PP melt-blown membrane (water contact angle similar to 130 degrees, underwater oil contact angle similar to 0). Moreover, the filtration performance is at a high level (similar to 99%). The behaviors are comparable or even superior to the typical reported results in the references (such as the mussel-inspired superhydrophilic PVDF membrane and copper mesh).

As such, a spatial framework integrating WNB with GIS was developed to assess the risk of urban waterlogging using the primary urban area of Guangzhou in China as an example. The results show that 1) the rationality of six spatial factors was determined according to the Conditional Probability Tables and weights; 2) the Most Accurate Sampling Table has objectivity; and 3) the areas with a high likelihood of waterlogging risk were mainly located in the southwestern part of the study area. The northeastern zones are relatively free of waterlogging risk. The results reveal a more accurate spatial pattern of urban waterlogging risk that can be used to identify risk hot spots. The resulting gridded estimates provide a realistic reference for decision making related to urban waterlogging. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Silicon plays a substantial role in alleviating heavy metal toxicity in crop plants. In this study, two rice varieties, Feng-Hua-Zhan and Hua-Hang-Si-Miao, were chosen to determine the effects of Si application on root morphological traits, cell structure and exudates of rice roots under Cd and/or Zn stress. Single or combined applications of Cd and Zn resulted in significant reduction of total root length, root surface area, root volume, average root diameter and root activity. However, 1.5 mM Si addition reversed these negative effects. Transmission electron microscopy observations showed that rice root cortex cells were heavily damaged under Cd and/or Zn stress for both two varieties, whereas Si addition resulted in improved cell structure integrity. In addition, lower levels of oxalic, acetic, tartaric, maleic and fumaric acids in root exudates were observed for Feng-Hua-Zhan under Cd and/or Zn stress, but addition of Si increased the acid levels. For Hua-Hang-Si-Miao, heavy metal treatments significantly reduced oxalic and fumaric acid levels and increased acetic, tartaric and maleic acid levels, whereas Si treatment showed opposite results. The above results indicated that Si could ameliorate the toxicity of heavy metals (Cd and Zn) for rice which resulted in improving root traits, cell structure and influencing root exudates.","[Fan, Xueying; Wen, Xiaohui; Huang, Fei; Cai, Yixia; Cai, Kunzheng] South China Agr Univ, Minist Agr, Key Lab Trop Agroenvironm, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Fan, Xueying] Guangdong Inst Microbiol, Guangdong Detect Ctr Microbiol, Lab Ecotox & Environm Safety, Guangzhou 510070, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; South China Agricultural University; Guangdong Academy of Sciences; Institute of Microbiology, Guangdong Academy of Sciences","Cai, KZ (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Minist Agr, Key Lab Trop Agroenvironm, Guangzhou 510642, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",kzcai@scau.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [31370456, 41501338]; Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province [2013B020310010]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province,"This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31370456, 41501338), and Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province (2013B020310010).",,46,60,66,35,235,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0137-5881,1861-1664,,ACTA PHYSIOL PLANT,Acta Physiol.

The existing buildings bear of both poor thermal performance of building envelope and poor indoor thermal environment. With the development of social economy, increasing demand towards building indoor thermal environment is much more urgent than before, and hence energy consumption has rapidly risen. Energy efficiency retrofit with low cost has become a priority in this region. Universities and colleges are one of the typical energy consumers in this region, which are insufficient in research. Over all the campus buildings, research building occupies a large part in total campus energy use, and hence becomes the main retrofit objects. Research buildings have complicated functions of offices, scientific research and laboratories, and space heating and cooling behaviors have their own characteristics, which have the large effect on space heating and cooling use. However, there is little knowledge about adaptive thermal comfort and corresponding heating and conditioning energy-use behaviors. In view of this, in this paper, a typical research building located in Hangzhou was chosen and the measurements on indoor thermal environment heating and cooling behaviors, fenestration and energy consumption were carried out during July 2016 to October 2017. By the analysis on field investigation, delivered questionnaires and measured data, the typical space heating and cooling behaviors, fenestration and thermal environment are analyzed. On this base, energy efficiency optimization strategies in terms of building envelope thermal performance, sun shading, and adaptive space heating and cooling behavior are explored by the simulation. The study provides the technic support for energy saving retrofitting of campus buildings in this region.","[Ge, Jian; Wu, Jiajing; Chen, Shuqin; Wu, Jindong] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Chen, SQ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",hn_csq@126.com,,,China National Key R&D Program Solutions to heating and cooling of buildings in the Yangtze river region [2016YFC0700301]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51561135002],China National Key R&D Program Solutions to heating and cooling of buildings in the Yangtze river region; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The study has been supported by the China National Key R&D Program Solutions to heating and cooling of buildings in the Yangtze river region (Grant No. 2016YFC0700301), National Natural Science Foundation of China Low carbon climate-responsive Heating and Cooling of Cities (LoHCool) (Grant No. 51561135002).",,15,59,63,7,67,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,2352-7102,,J BUILD ENG,J.

In China, the BB emission has changed substantially over the past decades while the mull-year variation held high uncertainty and the driving forces have addressed little attention. Here, this research aimed to conduct a comprehensive and systematic analysis of BB variation in China and provided precise and targeted BB emission reduction suggestions. The moving of high emission for BB from 2003 to 2014 was clearly identified, by the view of reliable emission estimation and anthropogenic impacts. Multiple satellite products, field survey, time varying biomass loading data and measured emission factors were adopted to better estimating BB emission and reducing the uncertainty. Social-economic analysis was added to assess the anthropogenic impacts on high emission variation quantitatively. Results showed that the cumulative BB emissions of OC, EC, CH4, NOx, NMVOC, SO2, NH3, CO, CO2, PM2.5 and PM10 during 2003-2014 were 1.6 x 10(4), 5.64 x 10(3), 3.57 x 10(4), 1.7 x 10(4), 5.44 x 10(4), 2.96 x 10(3), 6.77 x 10(3), 6.5 x 10(5), 1.15 x 10(7), 5.26 x 10(4) and 6.04 x 10(4) Gg, respectively. Crop straw burning (in-field and domestic) in northeast China plain (NEP), north China plain (NCP), northern arid and semiarid region and loess plateau were the key sources, averagely contributed 73% for all the pollutants emission. While domestic straw burning and firewood burning in Sichuan basin (SB), Yunnan-Guizhou plateau and southern China were main contributors, averagely accounting for 70% of all the pollutants emission. On regional level, high emissions were mainly found in SB, NCP and NEP. Temporally, high emissions were mainly found in crop sowing harvesting and heating seasons. From 2003 to 2014, the BB emission for different biomass species has changed significantly in different regions. High emission has gradually moved from SB to NCP and NEP. Firewood burning and domestic straw burning emission decreased by 47% and 14% in SB, respectively. Infield straw burning emission increased by 52% and 231% in NCP and NEP respectively and domestic straw burning emission increased by 62% in NEP. Emissions from heating season have decreased while emissions in corn harvest season were continuously increased. Analysis of Environmental kuznets curve, agricultural productivity level, human burning habits, rural energy structure and local control policies revealed the internal human driving strength of the variation for BB emission. The unbalanced development of social economy and the policy bias were primary drivers of limiting the BB management. BB emission will alleviate in NCP and aggravate in NEP. For the further emission reduction, effective measures for corn sources management, straw returning and rural energy utilization should be systematically considered. This research provides a clear evidence for the multi-year variation pattern of BB emissions, which is critical for pollution prediction, air quality modeling and targeted mitigation strategies for the key regions of China.","[Wu, Jian; Zheng, Mingming; Qi, Shihua] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Kong, Shaofei; Wu, Fangqi; Cheng, Yi; Zheng, Shurui; Qin, Si; Liu, Xi; Yan, Qin; Zheng, Huang; Yan, Yingying] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Liu, Dantong; Ding, Shuo] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Dept Atmospher Sci, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Delong] Beijing Weather Modificat Off, Beijing 100089, Peoples R China; [Shen, Guofeng] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Tianliang] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Phys, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Qi, Shihua] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences; China University of Geosciences; Zhejiang University; Peking University; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; China University of Geosciences,"Qi, SH (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Environm Sci & Technol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Kong, SF (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Dept Atmospher Sci, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.;Qi, SH (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",kongshaofei@cug.edu.cn; shihuaqi@cug.edu.cn,"Liu, Dantong/AAY-1281-2020; Ding, Shuo/AAY-1290-2020; ZHAO, TIANLIANG/JGC-6865-2023; Liu, Xi/IVV-7257-2023; Kong, Shaofei/I-7015-2012; SHEN, Guofeng/F-3163-2015; Yingying, Yan/Z-4084-2019","Liu, Dantong/0000-0003-3768-1770; Ding, Shuo/0000-0003-3669-8490; Liu, Xi/0000-0002-3152-5390; SHEN, Guofeng/0000-0002-7731-5399; Yingying, Yan/0000-0001-6251-0899; Zheng, Huang/0000-0002-9766-8335","Key Program of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China [2016YFA0602002, 2017YFC0212602]; National Natural Science Fund [41830965]; Key Program for Technical Innovation of Hubei Province [2017ACA089]; Program for Environmental Protection in Hubei Province [2017HB11]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) [G1323519230, 201616, 201802, CUG190609]; Start-up Foundation for Advanced Talents, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) [162301182756]","Key Program of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China; National Natural Science Fund(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Program for Technical Innovation of Hubei Province; Program for Environmental Protection in Hubei Province; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Start-up Foundation for Advanced Talents, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan)","This work was supported by the Key Program of Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (2016YFA0602002; 2017YFC0212602); the National Natural Science Fund (41830965); the Key Program for Technical Innovation of Hubei Province (2017ACA089) and the Program for Environmental Protection in Hubei Province (2017HB11).

This study develops a spatial framework integrating na < ve Bayes (NB) and geographic information system (GIS) to assess flooding hazard at regional scale. The methodology was demonstrated in the Bowen Basin in Australia as a case study. The inputs into the framework are five indices: elevation, slope, soil water retention, drainage proximity and density. They were derived from spatial data processed in ArcGIS. NB as a simplified and efficient type of Bayesian methods was used, with the assistance of remotely sensed flood inundation extent in the sampling process, to infer flooding probability on a cell-by-cell basis over the study area. A likelihood-based flooding hazard map was output from the GIS-based framework. The results reveal elevation and slope have more significant impacts on evaluation than other input indices. Area of high likelihood of flooding hazard is mainly located in the west and the southwest where there is a high water channel density, and along the water channels in the east of the study area. High likelihood of flooding hazard covers 45 % of the total area, medium likelihood accounts for about 12 %, low and very low likelihood represents 19 and 24 %, respectively. The results provide baseline information to identify and assess flooding hazard when making adaptation strategies and implementing mitigation measures in future. The framework and methodology developed in the study offer an integrated approach in evaluation of flooding hazard with spatial distributions and indicative uncertainties. It can also be applied to other hazard assessments.","[Liu, Rui; Wu, Jianping] East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China; [Liu, Rui; Chen, Yun] CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Gao, Lei] CSIRO Land & Water, Glen Osmond, SA, Australia; [Barrett, Damian] CSIRO Energy, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Xu, Tingbao] Australian Natl Univ, Fenner Sch Environm & Soc, Linnaeus Way, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Li, Linyi] Wuhan Univ, Sch Remote Sensing & Informat Engn, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Huang, Chang] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Peoples R China; [Yu, Jia] Shanghai Normal Univ, Dept Geog, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China",East China Normal University; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); CSIRO Land & Water; Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO); Division of Energy; Australian National University; Wuhan University; Northwest University Xi'an; Shanghai Normal University,"Liu, R (corresponding author), East China Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Informat Sci, Minist Educ, Shanghai 200241, Peoples R China.;Liu, R (corresponding author), CSIRO Land & Water, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",drruiliu@yeah.net; yun.chen@csiro.au; jpwu@geo.ecnu.edu.cn; lei.gao@csiro.au; damian.barrett@csiro.au; tingbao.xu@anu.edu.au; lilinyi@whu.edu.cn; changh@nwu.edu.cn; yujiashnu@126.com,"Chen, Yun/C-8672-2011; Barrett, Damian J/C-7972-2009; Huang, Chang/F-1518-2017; Gao, Lei/F-9698-2010","Chen, Yun/0000-0001-6819-6562; Barrett, Damian J/0000-0002-8215-4892; Huang, Chang/0000-0002-8621-4581; Gao, Lei/0000-0003-4272-9417",China Scholarship Council; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41201548]; Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission [12YZ086]; Funding Plan of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission for the Development of Young Teachers in Colleges and Universities [shsf019],China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission(Innovation Program of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission); Funding Plan of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission for the Development of Young Teachers in Colleges and Universities,"The authors appreciate the China Scholarship Council for providing a scholarship to Rui Liu to support this research at CSIRO Land and Water (CLW).

In this study, the precipitation time series from a network of 90 weather stations in Northeast China (NEC) and for the period of 1961-2009 are used. An objective method, the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis method, is applied to determine the thresholds of extreme events. Notable occurrence frequency and strong intensity of extreme precipitation (EP) mainly occur in Liaoning Province and the piedmont regions in Changbai Mountains and Xiao Hinggan Mountains. Generally, EP frequency shows a nonsignificant negative trend, whereas EP intensity has a weak and nonsignificant positive trend for the entire NEC in the period of 1961-2009. To assess EP severity, we propose an EP severity index (EPSI) combining both EP frequency and intensity, rather than separately analyze the EP frequency or intensity. Spatial gradients of EPSI are observed in northeast-southwest and northwest-southeast directions over NEC. The EPSI in northwestern and southeastern NEC are low (0.02-0.3), whereas high EPSI (0.34-0.83) occurs in the southwestern and northeastern portions of the region. Higher EPSI (0.4-0.83) occurs in southern Liaoning Province, which decreases along the southwest-northeast direction. The spatial patterns of EPSI are associated with the circulation over East Asia. Areas that have a short distance from sea and that locate in the windward slope of mountain will probably accompany high EP severity over NEC.","[Du, Haibo; Wu, Zhengfang; Zong, Shengwei; Meng, Xiangjun; Wang, Lei] NE Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China,"Wu, ZF (corresponding author), NE Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Renmin St 5268, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.",wuzf@nenu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation [41171038]; Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province [20101561],National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province,"This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation (41171038) and the Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province (20101561).

To do so, we introduce three examples of 'alternative' local and regional development activities in Europe: (a) social economy projects to tackle problems of localized social inequalities and local development; (b) public sector procurement and related intiatives to create healthier diets; and (c) participatory municipal budgets as a means to make radical participatory democracy a practical proposition. We discuss the issues that arise from them in terms of a radical local and regional development strategy and how they help to re-formulate our theoretical agendas and research practice. Unlike many uncritical studies of 'successful' places that then seek mechanistically to transplant the bases of 'success' as 'off the shelf' blueprints to be applied in and to other places we instead see these examples as providing an alternative framework for thinking about local and regional development that adapts more general principles (such as those of equity, accountability and democracy) to the specifics and local and regioanl circumstances.","Univ Durham, Wolfson Res Inst, Stockton On Tees TS17 6BH, England; Harokopio Univ, Athens, Greece",Durham University; Harokopio University Athens,"Hudson, R (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Wolfson Res Inst, Queens Campus,Univ Blvd, Stockton On Tees TS17 6BH, England.",ray.hudson@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,46,57,59,2,24,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0969-7764,1461-7145,,EUR URBAN REG STUD,Eur.

The most direct impact of human activities on rivers, for instance, regulating river can lead to degraded riverine ecosystems as part of the hydrological alteration. This paper determines the available ratio of water resource of natural or semi-natural rivers for ecological feasible regions using a method that transcends the traditional perspective of designed environmental flow. Our framework involves a modified percent of flow approach to identify the ecological feasible region of water resources utilization, which sequentially acts as a constraint for a reservoir optimization model based on the Cuckoo Search algorithm to obtain an optimal diversion process. Indicators of the hydrological alteration statistical method and the histogram matching approach are used to examine the framework's performance. The Han to Wei inter-basin water transfer project of China is selected as a case study. Results indicate that: (1) the allowable diversion rate with this modified percent of flow approach is more effective for reducing interference of diversion on the ecosystems than the conventional planned diversion rule; water demand, however, cannot be satisfied by the allowable diversion rate; (2) ecological feasible region is an accessible constraint for reservoir operation model, and the optimal diversion rate of such model is a trade-off output between the human water demand and the riverine ecosystems protection; and (3) increased allowable diversion rates alter flow indicators including the February flow, 30-day minimum flow, and low pulse count more appreciably than does the optimal diversion rate. This study provides key insights on how to achieve a trade-off between human water demand and riverine ecosystems protection, therefore contributing to the local sustainable development of social economy and ecological environment.

It can result in a huge loss of social economy and personal property, accordingly hindering the sustainable development of a city. Impervious surface expansion, especially the irregular spatial pattern of impervious surfaces, derived from rapid urbanization processes has been proven to be one of the main influential factors behind urban waterlogging. Therefore, optimizing the spatial pattern of impervious surfaces through urban renewal is an effective channel through which to attenuate urban waterlogging risk for developed urban areas. However, the most important step for the optimization of the spatial pattern of impervious surfaces is to understand the mechanism of the impact of urbanization processes, especially the spatiotemporal pattern of impervious surfaces, on urban waterlogging. This research aims to elucidate the mechanism of urbanization's impact on waterlogging by analysing the spatiotemporal characteristics and variance of urban waterlogging affected by urban impervious surfaces in a case study of Guangzhou in China. First, the study area was divided into runoff plots by means of the hydrologic analysis method, based on which the analysis of spatiotemporal variance was carried out. Then, due to the heterogeneity of urban impervious surface effects on waterlogging, a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was utilized to assess the spatiotemporal variance of the impact of impervious surface expansion on urban rainstorm waterlogging during the period from the 1990s to the 2010s. The results reveal that urban rainstorm waterlogging significantly expanded in a dense and circular layer surrounding the city centre, similar to the impervious surface expansion affected by urbanization policies. Taking the urban runoff plot as the research unit, GWR has achieved a good modelling effect for urban storm waterlogging. The results show that the impervious surfaces in the runoff plots of the southeastern part of Yuexiu, the southern part of Tianhe and the western part of Haizhu, which have experienced major urban engineering construction, have the strongest correlation with urban rainstorm waterlogging. However, for different runoff plots, the impact of impervious surfaces on urban waterlogging is quite different, as there exist other influence factors in the various runoff plots, although the impervious surface is one of the main factors. This result means that urban renewal strategy to optimize the spatial pattern of impervious surfaces for urban rainstorm waterlogging prevention and control should be different for different runoff plots. The results of the GWR model analysis can provide useful information for urban renewal strategy-making.","[Yu, Huafei; Zhao, Yaolong; Fu, Yingchun; Li, Le] South China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China",South China Normal University,"Zhao, YL; Fu, YC (corresponding author), South China Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Guangzhou 510631, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",yuhuafei@m.scnu.edu.cn; zhaoyaolong@m.scnu.edu.cn; fuyc@m.scnu.edu.cn; lile.joanna@gmail.com,"Zhao, Yaolong/V-1489-2019","Yu, Huafei/0000-0002-2542-5246","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871292]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M630962]; Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China [201803030034, 201802030008]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41871292), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018M630962), and the Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou, China (No. 201803030034, 201802030008).",,95,56,59,30,178,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,OCT,2018,10,10,,,,,,,3761,10.3390/su10103761,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10103761,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GY4UB,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000448559400403,View Full Record in Web of Science

The chemical fraction results indicated that Cd, Pb, Ni, and Zn exhibited higher mobility susceptibility and bioavailability with a significant and late anthropogenic origin. Hg and Cd might exert a potential hazardous influence on aquatic biota according to the geo-accumulation index (Igeo). The pollution load index (PLI) assessment suggested that all of the sediment samples have been contaminated. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that Zn, Cu, Hg, Cd, and Pb reflected the anthropogenic sources with a close correlation with TOC and socio-economic development; Ni, As and Cr tended to represent the geochemical background.

The major aim of this study is to estimate such association in an adult population which was drawn from an economically prosperous province of China. Methods: Study population was determined by multilevel randomized sampling. Education and income were chosen as indicators of individual SES, general obesity and abdominal obesity were measured by body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC). Descriptive statistical methods were used to depict overall and factor-specific distributions of general and abdominal obesity among 16,013 respondents. Two-step logistic regression models were fitted on gender basis. Results: The age-and-sex adjusted rates of general overweight, general obesity, abdominal overweight and abdominal obesity in study population were 28.9% (95%CI: 27.9%-29.9%), 7.5% (95%CI: 7.0%-8.1%), 32.2% (95%CI: 31.2%-33.3%) and 12.3% (95%CI: 11.6%-13.1%), respectively. Based on model fitting results, a significant inverse association between education and obesity only existed in women, while in men, income rather than education was positively related to obesity. Conclusions: The atypical SES-obesity relationship we found reflected the on-going social economy transformation in affluent regions of China. High-income men and poorly-educated women were at higher risk of obesity in Zhejiang province, thus merit intense focuses.","[Xiao, Yuanyuan; Wang, Hao; Zhang, Jie; He, Qingfang; Su, Danting; Zhao, Ming; Wang, Lixin; Zhang, Xinwei; Gong, Weiwei; Hu, Ruying; Yu, Min; Ding, Gangqiang; Cong, Liming] Zhejiang Prov Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ye, Zhen] Zhejiang Hlth Bur, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Yuanyuan; Zhao, Naiqing] Fudan Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Fudan University,"Ye, Z (corresponding author), Zhejiang Hlth Bur, 216 Qingchun Rd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",moolyshout_fang@163.com,"wang, xl/Y-8251-2019; chen, yijia/KGM-4378-2024; SUN, Ye/KBC-8159-2024; Wang, Xin/AAN-8435-2021; su, dan/GYJ-1940-2022; YE, Zhen/IYS-1774-2023; Wang, Xin/JCE-2009-2023; ding, gangqiang/AHD-5012-2022","Wang, Xin/0000-0002-4457-7376; Wang, Xin/0000-0002-4457-7376;",Zhejiang Provincial Major Special Project of Science and Technology [2011C13032-1],Zhejiang Provincial Major Special Project of Science and Technology,"This study was supported by Zhejiang Provincial Major Special Project of Science and Technology, grant number 2011C13032-1.

Cittaslow, a network of towns, are working with qualitative local urban development, based on similar principles as Slow Food. The 'slow' movements could be expected to have influences on tourism development. This possible connection has been neglected in the scientific tourism literature. Based on a study in three Cittaslow towns in Northern Italy, this article concentrates on how destination development is conducted in a Cittaslow context, unveiling some contradictions between the commercial sides of tourism and the non-commercial ethos of the Cittaslow movement. The studied towns were involved in various efforts in the field of sustainable planning, thereby also improving destination specific resources and local identity. One example is their focus on 'slow' events, mainly based on local gastronomy. Tourism marketing was, however, only of secondary importance; which mirrors some scepticism towards mass tourism and commercialisation, and even against marketing as such. Despite this, the Cittaslow concept may have an indirect potential for tourism development by improving product development and increased visibility. The risks involved concern gentrification and overexploitation.","[Nilsson, Jan Henrik; Svard, Ann-Charlotte] Lund Univ, Serv Management, Helsingborg, Sweden; [Widarsson, Asa] Lund Univ, Serv Management, Malmo, Sweden; [Wirell, Theres] Lund Univ, Serv Management, Wettingen, Switzerland",Lund University; Lund University,"Nilsson, JH (corresponding author), Lund Univ, Serv Management, Helsingborg, Sweden.",jan-henrik.nilsson@msm.lu.se,,"Nilsson, Jan Henrik/0000-0001-6803-1995",,,,,54,53,61,6,122,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1368-3500,1747-7603,,CURR ISSUES TOUR,Curr.

In this paper, the Ordos Plateau in China was selected as the research region and a quantitative method for desertification assessment was developed by using Landsat MSS and TM/ETM+ data on a regional scale. In this method, NDVI, MSDI and land surface albedo were selected as assessment indicators of desertification to represent land surface conditions from vegetation biomass, landscape pattern and micrometeorology. Based on considering the effects of vegetation type and time of images acquired on assessment indictors, assessing rule sets were built and a decision tree approach was used to assess desertification of Ordos Plateau in 1980, 1990 and 2000. The average overall accuracy of three periods was higher than 90%. The results showed that although some local places of Ordos Plateau experienced an expanding trend of desertification, the trend of desertification of Ordos Plateau was an overall decrease in from 1980 to 2000. By analyzing the causes of desertification processes, it was found that climate change could benefit for the reversion of desertification from 1980 to 1990 at a regional scale and human activities might explain the expansion of desertification in this period; however human conservation activities were the main driving factor that induced the reversion of desertification from 1990 to 2000.","[Xu, Duanyang; Zhuang, Dafang; Pan, Jianjun] Nanjing Agr Univ, Collage Resources & Environm Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu Prov, Peoples R China; [Kang, Xiangwu] Inst Sci & Tech Informat China, Beijing 100038, Peoples R China; [Xu, Duanyang; Qiu, Dongsheng; Zhuang, Dafang] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Nanjing Agricultural University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Zhuang, DF (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Collage Resources & Environm Sci, Nanjing 210095, Jiangsu Prov, Peoples R China.",duanyang_xu@126.com; kangxw@istic.ac.cn; qiuds@igsnrr.ac.cn; zhuangdf@lreis.ac.cn; jpan@njau.edu.cn,,,The Chinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-YW-G-036]; China Earthquake Administration [200708007-03]; Chinese National Academic Institution [2005DIA3J006],The Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); China Earthquake Administration; Chinese National Academic Institution,"This research was supported and funded by the Knowledge Innovation Project of The Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant NO.

J,"Zografos, C",,,,"Zografos, Christos",,,Rurality discourses and the role of the social enterprise in regenerating rural Scotland,JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,social enterprise; rural Scotland; rurality discourses; Q methodology,Q METHODOLOGY,"Social enterprises are businesses with primarily social objectives that reinvest their surplus in the community rather than seeking to maximise profit for shareholders. However, there is a debate regarding the drivers and the role of the social enterprise, the outcome of which is expected to have serious implications for the future of the institution [Brady, C., 2003. Social Enterprise development and the Role of the Social Economy in Scotland. CBS Network, Edinburgh]. A 'reformist' view supports the position that social enterprises are simple extensions of existing economic systems, whereas a 'radical' stance sees them as the embodiment of an alternative vision of running local economies. Development Trusts (DTs) are social enterprises that focus on community regeneration. Our research explored DT stakeholder views regarding the role of DTs in regenerating rural Scotland. Using Q methodology [Barry, J., Proops, J., 1999. Seeking sustainability discourses with Q methodology. Ecological Economics, 28, 337-345], we drew on 'rurality' discourses [Frouws, J., 1998. The contested redefinition of the countryside. An analysis of rural discourses in The Netherlands. Sociologia Ruralis 38(l), 54-68] expressed by DT stakeholders in order to investigate how these discourses informed their views. Radical positions were mostly associated with a hedonist rurality discourse and were split into three sub-discourses, whereas reformist positions mostly reflected a utilitarian rurality discourse. There was consensus between discourses in rejecting a primary DT contribution to rural regeneration by substituting state and local authority functions in rural Scotland. Results suggest that stakeholders prefer that DTs develop their own agendas and activity rather than try to substitute unsuccessful state or local authority provision of rural services. Social enterprise strategies and support policies promoting a service-providing role for DTs in rural Scotland should consider this issue if they are to avoid stakeholder objection and contribute to the success of DTs in becoming active vehicles of rural regeneration.

Based on the concept of coordination, the interaction between the social economic and resource environment can be modeled by a coupling coordination degree model. Using this method, we evaluated the social economic index and resource environment index based on an improved catastrophe progression model. Panel data comprising 21 factors were collected from 2001, 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013 for 18 cities in Henan, China, and used to analyze developmental progress. The coupling coordination degree was also studied using the exploratory spatial data analysis technique and rescaled range analysis, which explained the patterns in spatial variation and its future trends. The results showed are as follows: (1) Social economic development and resource environment status exhibited an increasing trend. Cities were classified into four categories according to their average evaluation ranking in terms of social economic and the resource environment subsystem. (2) The coupling coordination class changed from slight disorder depression to moderate coordinated development, which reflected the optimization of internal subsystems. (3) An approximately inverted U-shaped curve was obtained for the coupling coordination degree in both the east-west and north-south directions. The overall spatial pattern in Henan was middle high and low in surrounding areas. (4) In the future, the extent of coordination is expected to increase continuously. Thus, Henan should focus on green development, accelerate the establishment of a resource-saving and environmentally friendly society, promote sustainable economic development, and facilitate the sustainable utilization of the resource environment.","[Sun, Qian; Zhang, Xiaohu; Zhang, Hanwei; Niu, Haipeng] Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Surveying & Land Informat Engn, Jiaozuo, Peoples R China",Henan Polytechnic University,"Zhang, XH (corresponding author), Henan Polytech Univ, Sch Surveying & Land Informat Engn, Jiaozuo, Peoples R China.",zhangxiaohu@hpu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1404402]; Key Project of Humanities and Social Science of Henan Province [2015-ZD-045]; Soft Science Research Plan of Henan Province [162400410273],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Project of Humanities and Social Science of Henan Province; Soft Science Research Plan of Henan Province,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U1404402), the Key Project of Humanities and Social Science of Henan Province (No. 2015-ZD-045), the Soft Science Research Plan of Henan Province (no. 162400410273).",,56,52,61,6,126,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1387-585X,1573-2975,,ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN,Environ.

This can, and often does, involve competition between SEOs in limited local markets and in search of state grant income. For those that seek to transcend these limits, the tensions between the economic and the social can become acute, especially in those that seek to become self-consciously near-market social enterprises, with a growing focus upon their economic role and contribution and trading as the route to growth. This typically leads them into competition with firms in the mainstream capitalist economy, engendering tensions between the need to survive in competitive markets and the ethical and social motivations that informed their original formation. I then consider broader questions as to imaginaries about the social economy and of how the social economy is seen in the policy and academic literatures in terms of its socio-economic role. Finally, I offer some reflective comments as to the future for SEOs and the social economy and their contribution to social and economic life.","Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England",Durham University,"Hudson, R (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",ray.hudson@durham.ac.uk,,,,,,,25,52,59,0,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Over a 12-week period in 2009, data were gathered through participant observation and bi-weekly recall interviews with 10 ilagiit households in the community. The findings are compared to data on sharing collected in 1999 from the same family group. Results indicate that resource sharing, especially for country food, continues to follow traditional kinship patterns and retains considerable importance in the group's aggregated income. Further, imported foods are shared, but on what appears to be an ad hoc basis, while control of money appears to rest with individuals. Overall, differences between households in cash income, seen in terms of hunting and fishing equipment, are more apparent in 2009 than in 1999, but this inequality is moderated by shared use among close kin of large items like freighter canoes and outboard motors. At this time, social relations critically buffer subsistence disparities between lower- and higher-income households in culturally prescribed ways. Our study of the socioeconomic dynamics within an Arctic community is particularly valuable for informing a culturally relevant understanding of Arctic food security, given significant recent interest in this research area.","[Harder, Miriam T.; Wenzel, George W.] McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada",McGill University,"Wenzel, GW (corresponding author), McGill Univ, Dept Geog, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",wenzel@geog.mcgill.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Indian and Northern Affairs Canada's Northern Scientific Training Program; Government of Nunavut; National Science Foundation; Northern Scientific Training Program,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Indian and Northern Affairs Canada's Northern Scientific Training Program; Government of Nunavut; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Northern Scientific Training Program,"We wish to express our utmost gratitude for the extraordinary patience and generosity of the residents of Clyde River who participated in the 1999 and 2009 research projects.

As a crucial component of urban water environment system, urban lake is mainly influenced by social economic system and tourism system. In this paper, a framework for quantitatively evaluating development sustainability of urban lake was established by a multi-objective model that represented water ecological carrying capacity (WECC). And nine key indicators including population, irrigation area, tourist quantity, the average number of hotel daily reception, TP, TN, CODMn, BOD5 were chosen from urban social-economy system and natural resilience aspects, with their index weight was determined by using the Structure Entropy Weight method. Then, we took Wuhan East Lake, the largest urban lake in China as a case study, and selected five time sections including 2002, 2004, 2007, 2009 and 2012 to synthetically evaluate and comparatively analyze the dynamic change of WECC. The results showed that: firstly, the water ecological carrying capacity values of the East Lake in five time sections were 1.17, 1.07, 1.64, 1.53 and 2.01 respectively, which all exceeded 1 and increased fluctuation. The rapid growth of population and GDP lead to sharply increasing demand for water quantity. However, a large amount of the domestic sewage and industrial waste led by economic development increases pressure on ecological environment of urban lakes. Secondly, the carrying capacity of the East Lake for tourist activities was still low. The value in 2012 was only 0.22, keeping at a slowly increasing phase, which indicates that the East Lake has large opportunity and space for developing the water resource carrying capacity and could make further efforts to attract tourists. Moreover, the WECC of the East Lake was mainly affected by rapid social and economic development and water environment damage caused by organic pollutants. From the view of urban water sustainable management, we must deeply recognize the reality that water shortages and the limited carrying capacity, and dynamic assessment of WECC provides an early warning approach and control direction of water environment. For the East Lake, it is the primary target to mitigate the carrying capacity of social-economy, especially for prevention of lake area encroachment shrinking and domestic wastewater discharge.

Angiogenesis, a key step in the wound healing process, provides sufficient oxygen and nutrients to the wound area. However, traditional clinical interventions are not enough to stabilize the formation of the vascular system to support wound healing. Due to the unique properties and multiple functions of nanomaterials, it has made a major breakthrough in the application of medicine. Nanomaterials provide a more effective treatment to hasten the angiogenesis and wound healing, by stimulating fundamental factors in the vascular regeneration phase. In the present review article, the basic stages and molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis are analyzed, and the types, applications, and prospects of nanomaterials used in angiogenesis are detailed. Impact statement Wound healing (especially chronic wounds) is currently a clinically important issue. The long-term nonhealing of chronic wounds often plagues patients, medical systems, and causes huge losses to the social economy. There is currently no effective method of treating chronic wounds in the clinic. Angiogenesis is an important step in wound healing. Nanomaterials had properties that are not found in conventional materials, and they have been extensively studied in angiogenesis. This review article provides readers with the molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis and the types and applications of angiogenic nanomaterials, hoping to bring inspiration to overcome chronic wounds.","[Cui, Longlong; Liang, Jiaheng; Liu, Han; Zhang, Kun] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China; [Li, Jingan] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Henan Key Lab Adv Magnesium Alloy, Key Lab Mat Proc & Mold Technol,Minist Educ, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University; Zhengzhou University,"Zhang, K (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China.;Li, JG (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Mat Sci & Engn, Henan Key Lab Adv Magnesium Alloy, Key Lab Mat Proc & Mold Technol,Minist Educ, Zhengzhou 450001, Peoples R China.",zhangkun@zzu.edu.cn; lijingan@zzu.edu.cn,"zhang, kun/HPB-5142-2023",,Fostering Talents of National Natural Science Foundation of China and Henan Province [U1504310]; Key Scientific Research Projects of Higher Education Institutions in Henan Province [16A430030]; Key Scientific and Technological Research Projects in Henan Province [182102310076]; Top Doctor Program of Zhengzhou University [3210475]; Joint Fund for Fostering Talents of NCIR-MMT HNKL-MMT [MMT2017-01],Fostering Talents of National Natural Science Foundation of China and Henan Province; Key Scientific Research Projects of Higher Education Institutions in Henan Province; Key Scientific and Technological Research Projects in Henan Province; Top Doctor Program of Zhengzhou University; Joint Fund for Fostering Talents of NCIR-MMT HNKL-MMT,"This research was funded by The Fostering Talents of National Natural Science Foundation of China and Henan Province, grant no.

This article's critical analysis of social finance contributes to cultural economy research into marketization processes in economic geography and allied fields. First, responding to calls for greater attention to be given to heterogeneous and variegated market-making processes 'on the ground', social finance is analysed as a relatively discrete and hybrid modality of marketization that makes possible the valuation and capitalization of the social economy to address collective social problems. Second, moving beyond topographical accounts that understand geographies of marketization as 'taking place' through the outward expansion of the market's imagined boundaries, Gilles Deleuze's concept of 'the fold' is elaborated upon to develop a topological analysis of the spatial constitution of social finance markets. The folds of social finance are seams of inflection, entanglements where the social utility typically lacking from mainstream finance is variously spliced and stitched into marketization processes. In social finance markets-in-the-making, 'the social' is also shown to be remade as an array of thoroughly liberal associations and subjectivities that are, at once, pluralist, ethical and entrepreneurial.","[Langley, Paul] Univ Durham, South Rd, Durham DH1 7LE, England",Durham University,"Langley, P (corresponding author), Univ Durham, South Rd, Durham DH1 7LE, England.",paul.langley@durham.ac.uk,,"Langley, Paul/0000-0002-1924-7711",ESRC [ES/N005988/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,66,48,48,1,42,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0308-518X,1472-3409,,ENVIRON PLANN A,Environ.

Drought and flood events are the primary disasters in Heilongjiang Province and have considerable impacts on agriculture. In this study, relatively complete monthly precipitation data from 26 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province during the period of 1958-2013 were analyzed using the standardized precipitation index (SPI) combined with principal component analysis, Mann-Kendall trend analysis and Morlet wavelet analysis to determine the spatial and temporal distributions of drought and flood events in this province. The results were as follows: (1) the whole of Heilongjiang exhibited an aridity trend. In northern Heilongjiang, spring and summer experienced a wetting trend, and autumn and winter experienced an aridity trend. (2) The SPI3 exhibited 8- and 16-year periodic variation characteristics in spring, 10- and 22-year periodic variation characteristics in summer, and 10- and 32-year periodic variation characteristics in autumn. In addition to the 10-year periodic variation characteristics in winter, other periodic variation characteristics were observed. (3) The increasing trend in the percentage of stations affected by flood was more obvious than that affected by drought. Therefore, Heilongjiang Province is more vulnerable to flooding. (4) The influence of drought and flood disasters in Heilongjiang Province showed a growth trend, but the flood effect was more remarkable. (5) The agricultural area affected by drought and flood disasters in Heilongjiang Province showed an increasing trend. Although there was a greater increase in flood disaster area, the main types of disasters were drought-dominated.","[Fu, Qiang; Zhou, Zhaoqiang; Li, Tianxiao; Liu, Dong; Hou, Renjie; Cui, Song; Yan, Peiru] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Promote Grain Prod Heilong, Harbin 150030, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China; [Fu, Qiang; Zhou, Zhaoqiang; Li, Tianxiao; Liu, Dong; Hou, Renjie; Cui, Song; Yan, Peiru] Northeast Agr Univ, Harbin 150030, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China",Northeast Agricultural University - China,"Fu, Q (corresponding author), Collaborat Innovat Ctr Promote Grain Prod Heilong, Harbin 150030, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.;Fu, Q (corresponding author), Northeast Agr Univ, Harbin 150030, Heilongjiang, Peoples R China.",fuqiang0629@126.com,"CUI, SONG/P-5328-2018; Fu, Qi/HTT-2030-2023","CUI, SONG/0000-0002-2567-8999; Fu, Qiang/0000-0003-4100-2777","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51709044, 51479032]; National Key RD Plan [2017YFC0406002]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key RD Plan,"This research was supported by funds from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51709044, and 51479032) and the National Key R&D Plan (2017YFC0406002).",,59,48,50,7,90,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1436-3240,1436-3259,,STOCH ENV RES RISK A,Stoch.

To analyze water recycling and climate change, variable gravity field spherical harmonic coefficients data from GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) were used to compute the terrestrial equivalent water height and then compared with data from GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System) terrestrial hydrological assimilation. The data were taken from 11 years of monthly scaled measurements during the time period from January 2003 to March 2013. The investigation of the interannual and seasonal terrestrial water storage changes at the Tianshan Mountains and the surrounding areas revealed the conclusions: (1) Interannual variability, accompanied by interannual and seasonal fluctuations in terrestrial water storage, showed a decreasing trend throughout the research period, with an average reduction rate 0.42 +/- 0.12 cm per year and with a minimal value occurred in 2009. (2) The seasonal maximum of terrestrial water storage occurred in spring (March to May), and the monthly maximum (22 mm) in April; the seasonal minimum of terrestrial water storage occurred in autumn (September to November), and the monthly minimum (-23 mm) occurred in October. (3) Spatially, terrestrial water storage increased in the western portion of the study area, and decreased in the eastern and middle portions. (4) In comparing the two types of data, we see that terrestrial water storage inverted by GRACE and GLDAS shows good consistency with significant liner relations, and that the peak value of terrestrial water storage calculated by GLDAS appeared about 131 days earlier than GRACE.

(b) The impacts of human activity and climatic changes on the sediment load and runoff changes are greater in smaller river basins (e.g. the Jialingjiang River basin) than in larger river basins. The response of sediment load and runoff changes to the impacts of human activities and climatic changes are prompt and prominent in the Jialingjiang River basin relative to those in the mainstem of the Yangtze River basin. (c) Construction of the Three Gorges Dam has already had obvious impacts on the sediment transport process in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin, but shows no obvious influence on the runoff changes. Construction of the Three Gorges Dam will result in further re-adjustment of the scouring/filling process within the river channel in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin, and have corresponding effects on the altered sediment load because of the Dam's operation for the river channel, ecology, Sustainable social economy and even the development of the Yangtze Delta.

Design/methodology/approach - The research is a cross-sectional study and involved collection of quantitative data. The sample is made up of Portuguese organizations belonging to the social economy sector The survey consisted of 205 employees. Path analysis was applied, using maximum-likelihood estimation procedures. Findings - Path analysis results show that the proposed model has a good fit with the data. Training and knowledge management practices are a function of knowledge-centered culture and organizational commitment. Research limitations/implications - The research is focused on social economy organizations, therefore generalization of results to other sectors must be cautious. Although a comprehensible model is presented, it does not cover an exhaustive list of critical factors for knowledge management. Additionally, this research is of a cross-sectional nature, which does not capture dynamic changes. Practical implications - The research contributes to the existing literature about the critical factors of knowledge management. Social economy organizations that are developing knowledge management practices should attend to the predominant type of organizational commitment and should base their training policies on a knowledge-centered culture. Originality/value - Empirical evidence obtained in this study will be of use not only to social economy organizations wanting to become knowledge management ones, but also to researchers wanting to develop a more comprehensive framework of factors that influence (positively or negatively) knowledge management, specifically within social economy organizations.","[Cardoso, Leonor; Meireles, Andreia] Univ Coimbra, Fac Psychol & Sci Educ, Coimbra, Portugal; [Peralta, Carlos Ferreira] Catholic Univ Portugal, Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Cardoso, L (corresponding author), Univ Coimbra, Fac Psychol & Sci Educ, Coimbra, Portugal.",lcardoso@fpce.uc.pt,"Peralta, Carlos/HGA-1696-2022; Pais, Leonor/N-2688-2013","Pais, Leonor/0000-0002-2087-5950",,,,,92,47,62,0,53,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1367-3270,1758-7484,,J KNOWL MANAG,J.

However, the interaction among social economy, water, and ecology are complex. The data scales between socioeconomic factors (normally at the spatial scale of the administrative region and the temporal scale of a year or month) and river water quality and ecological factors (normally at the spatial scale of a sub-basin and the temporal scale of an instantaneous value) do not match. Therefore, many current regulation methods do not sufficiently consider the interaction mechanisms between socioeconomic, water, and ecological factors or cannot adequately deal with the scale of the data. In this study, we proposed a new framework to assess the coordinated development of social economy, water, and ecology (SWE) by integrating the distributed social economy-water ecological model (SEWE) and the harmonious regulation model. We built the SEWE model by coupling a rainfall runoff model, river water quality, and ecological models; we built the harmonious regulation model based on the harmony theory method. We applied the proposed method and framework to the Shaying River Basin, which exhibited typical characteristics of multiple sluices and dams, high pollution, and significant human activities. Results indicated that the coordinated development level of the SWE in the Shaying River Basin was poor, with the average coordination degree varying from 0.39 to 0.60. The average growth rate of the coordination degree of socioeconomic indicators was greater than that of the river water quality and ecological indicators. The coordination degree of water ecological indicators was small with a decreasing trend. These results indicated the increasing impact of socioeconomic development on river water quality and ecology.

An evaluation model was developed using a spatial principal component analysis (SPCA) model containing land use, soil erosion, topography, climate, vegetation and social economy variables. Using this model, an ecological vulnerability index was computed for the research region. Using natural breaks classification (NBC), the evaluation results were divided into five types: potential, slight, light, medium and heavy. The results indicate that there is greater than average optimism about the conditions of the study region, and the ecological vulnerability index (EVI) of the southern eight counties is lower than that of the northern twelve counties. From 1997 to 2011, the ecological vulnerability index gradually decreased, which means that environmental security was gradually enhanced, although there are still some places that have gradually deteriorated over the past 15 years. In the study area, government and economic factors and precipitation are the main reasons for the changes in ecological vulnerability.","[Hou, Kang; Li, Xuxiang; Zhang, Jing] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Li, XX (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Human Settlements & Civil Engn, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",houkang0311@stu.xjtu.edu.cn; hupo0311@hotmail.com; zhangjingzj0312@163.com,,,,,,,30,44,54,3,63,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-7827,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

As one of the regions with the highest human activity, the coordinated development of its ecological environment and social economy cannot be ignored. Based on the study of the relationship between ecological environment quality and socio-economic development, this paper proposed the Coastal Resource-environmental Carrying Capacity (CRECC) which including three subsystems (the Resource's system, the Ecological system, and the Socio-economical system), as well as 6 first-level indices and 20 s-level indicators. The entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process were used to calculate the average weight, and the changing rate of carrying capacity value was analyzed based on the ordinary least square method. Taking the coastal zone of Jiangsu Province as the study area, we calculated the changes of comprehensive/subsystems' carrying capacity from 2000 to 2015, and the trade-off relationship within the subsystem was analyzed. From 2000 to 2015, the value of CRECC, the Resource's system, and the Socio-economical system decreased while the Ecological system's value showed a volatility rise. Overall, the regional carrying capacity level was low. However, positive environmental management measures have significantly improved the status of the ecological environment and helped to alleviate the environmental pressure brought by population growth. the Ecological system played an important role in the change of regional carrying capacity. Vegetation coverage, coastal water environment quality index, tidal flat reclamation area, habitat, and ecological land proportion are significant influencing factors. This also Indicated that the landscape ecological status, offshore water quality and utilization of space resources in Jiangsu coastal zone aren't sustainable. Therefore, it is recommended to improve the ecological resilience of coastal zones, such as implementing spatial planning of tidal flat resources, and controlling pollutant discharge, etc. in order to promote the regional sustainable development.","[Liu, Rongjuan; Pu, Lijie; Zhu, Ming; Huang, Sihua; Jiang, Yu] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, Xianlin Rd 163, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Liu, Rongjuan; Pu, Lijie; Zhu, Ming; Huang, Sihua; Jiang, Yu] Minist Nat Resources, Key Lab Coastal Zone Exploitat & Protect, Xianlin Rd 163, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China",Nanjing University; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Pu, LJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, Xianlin Rd 163, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China.",lrj61887@163.com; ljpu@nju.edu.cn,,,"marine science and technology innovation special projects of Jiangsu Province, China [HY2018-3]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871083]","marine science and technology innovation special projects of Jiangsu Province, China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This work was supported by the marine science and technology innovation special projects of Jiangsu Province, China (Grant No. HY2018-3) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41871083).",,58,43,49,13,133,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,MAR 15,2020,186,,,,,,,,105092,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105092,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2020.105092,,,11,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,KR8FH,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000517850900004,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particularly, winter frost, freezing events and snow avalanche frequently causing severe effects on ecosystem and social economy, however, few long-term winter temperature records or reconstructions hinder a better understanding on variations in winter temperature in the vast area of the TP. In this paper, we present a minimum winter (November-February) temperature reconstruction for the past 668 years based on a tree-ring network (12 new tree-ring chronologies) on the southeastern TP. The reconstruction exhibits decadal to inter-decadal temperature variability, with cold periods occurring in 1423-1508, 1592-1651, 1729-1768, 1798-1847, 1892-1927, and 1958-1981, and warm periods in 1340-1422, 1509-1570, 1652-1728, 1769-1797, 1848-1891, 1928-1957, and 1982-2007. As suggested by the comparisons with existing winter temperature series and spatial correlations with Climatic Research Unit gridded data, our reconstruction is reliable and indicative, and it can represent large-scale winter temperature variability on the southeastern TP. Furthermore, it shows an overall agreement with winter temperature from the northeastern TP on decadal to inter-decadal timescales. It also shows the possible effects of volcanic eruption and reducing solar activity on the winter temperature variability for the past six centuries on the southeastern TP.","[Huang, Ru; Zhu, Haifeng; Liang, Eryuan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Huang, Ru] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 10049, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Haifeng; Liang, Eryuan] CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Liu, Bo] Northwest Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Xian 710127, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Shi, Jiangfeng] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Ruibo; Yuan, Yujiang] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Desert & Meteorol, Urumqi 830002, Peoples R China; [Griessinger, Jussi] Friedrich Alexander Univ Erlangen Nuremberg, Inst Geog, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Northwest University Xi'an; Nanjing University; China Meteorological Administration; University of Erlangen Nuremberg","Zhu, HF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Alpine Ecol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Zhu, HF (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhuhf@itpcas.ac.cn,"Grießinger, Jussi/JAO-0179-2023; Liang, Eryuan/A-1435-2010; Huang, Ru/AAT-8499-2020; Zhang, Ruibo/N-4666-2019; Grießinger, Jussi/D-6318-2013; Zhang, Ruibo/G-8475-2018; Huang, Ru/AAD-5744-2022","Liang, Eryuan/0000-0002-8003-4264; Huang, Ru/0000-0002-5124-1950; Zhang, Ruibo/0000-0002-4786-1006; Grießinger, Jussi/0000-0001-6103-2071; Zhang, Ruibo/0000-0002-4786-1006;","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571201, 41771240, 41661144040]; CAS West Light Foundation Program; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20050101]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); CAS West Light Foundation Program; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41571201, 41771240, 41661144040) and CAS West Light Foundation Program, and the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDA20050101).

Based on the statistics data of each component in temporal sequence (2006-2017) of Shandong province, the inherent relationship of the composite system was explored. The results showed that (1) the key influencing factors of the composite system were environmental pollution level, environmental protection intensity, urbanization extent, industrial structure type, and resource utilization efficiency (in descending order of importance); (2) the coordination degree between economy and urbanization subsystem was the lowest, therefore much more efforts should be made on the coordinated development between urbanization evolution and economic growth; (3) the coupling degree reached a high level for both subsystems and the composite system, in contrast, the coordination degree exhibited an increasing trend from low-level coordination to medium coordination.

Particularly, Changting County experiences severe erosion due to unreasonable human activities, high rainfall intensities, steep slopes, erodible parent material, and poor vegetation cover. In this study, a quantitative soil loss analysis and qualitative social surveys (data from 1999 to 2015) are integrated to identify the erosion vulnerable areas in Zhuxi watershed of Southern China. Using Zhuxi watershed as an example in the investigation of soil erosion problems, analytic hierarchy and entropy value methods are adopted to evaluate soil erosion vulnerability and determine the proportions of factors in an index system. The vulnerability of soil erosion is evaluated from the human-nature system coupling perspective, considering socio-economic factors, which are synthetically analyzed and evaluated for soil erosion exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Results show that (1) vulnerability is low in the east and west and highest in the middle of the Zhuxi watershed. The vulnerability of low, mild, and moderate soil erosions show a patchy distribution, wide range of intensity, and severe soil erosion fragility. (2) The degree of soil erosion vulnerability gradually decreased from 1999 to 2015. Low levels of vulnerability were distributed from fragmentation to concentrated distribution, while high vulnerabilities presented the opposite trend. However, the high levels of soil erosion showed a gradual decrease in vulnerability from 1999 to 2015.

The principal component analysis (PCA) approach is used to choose 7 crucial factors that contribute over 85% of information for early warning snow disasters on the TP. They are mean annual probability of snow disaster, number of snow-covered days, livestock stocking rate, continual days of mean daily temperature below -10 degrees C, grassland burial index, rate of snow-covered grassland, and per livestock gross domestic product. The chosen 411 cases from 2008 to 2010 are used to validate the prediction results from the developed early warning model, with an overall accuracy of 85.64% in predicting snow disasters and no disasters.

Urban ecological land can be defined as the natural base on which a city relies to ecologically survive. It closely links the social economy with the natural eco-environment, providing an important integrated approach to resolve the contradiction between urban expansion and natural ecosystems conservation in the process of urbanization. The research question addressed in this study is how to accurately identify the conservation priority areas for urban ecological land. Taking Zhuhai City, located in China, as an example, an approach based on seven kinds of water ecosystem services was put forward, combining social demand and natural supply for the services to determine service targets and conservation priority areas. The results showed that the conservation priority areas in Zhuhai City covered 868 km(2), accounting for 51.03% of the total land area, which were mainly covered by woodlands or paddy fields and fish ponds. In addition, by synthesizing ecological importance and ecological sensitivity, management zones for urban ecological land were delineated, including 510 km(2) of primary control areas and 358 km(2) of secondary control areas. In the supply and demand view of water ecosystem services, this study put forward an integrated ecosystem-based approach for conservation priority area identification of urban ecological land, aiming to prevent land degradation and achieve urban ecological sustainability.","[Peng, Jian; Luo, Lingwei; Li, Huilei; Hu, Yi'na] Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Wang, An; Wu, Jiansheng] Peking Univ, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Sch Urban Planning & Design, Key Lab Environm & Urban Sci, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wang, An] Guangdong Urban & Rural Planning & Design Inst, Planning Inst 3, Guangzhou 510290, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanxu] Beijing Normal Univ, Fac Geog Sci, State Key Lab Earth Surface Proc & Resource Ecol, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Meersmans, Jeroen] Cranfield Univ, Sch Water Energy & Environm, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Peking University; Peking University; Beijing Normal University; Cranfield University,"Peng, J (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, Lab Earth Surface Proc, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",jianpeng@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Wang, Anzhong/AAS-9614-2020; Liu, Yanxu/JOZ-4430-2023; Ma, Mingyang/JXM-3330-2024; Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020; Peng, Jian/AAO-6397-2020; Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020; meersmans, jeroen/T-2186-2017","Wu, Jian/0000-0001-9933-7364; Wu, Jian/0000-0002-3394-1507; meersmans, jeroen/0000-0001-6614-1453; peng, jian/0000-0003-0332-0248",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41271195],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 41271195",,57,41,49,16,217,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1085-3278,1099-145X,,LAND DEGRAD DEV,Land Degrad.

Nevertheless, the abundant natural resources of YRD have brought huge challenges to the area, and frequent human activities and natural disasters have damaged the ecological systems seriously, and certain ecological functions have been threatened. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the status of the ecological environment based on scientific methods, which can provide scientifically robust data for the managers or stakeholders to adopt timely ecological protection measures. The aim of this study was to obtain the spatial distribution of the ecological vulnerability (EV) in YRD based on 21 indicators selected from underwater status, soil condition, land use, landform, vegetation cover, meteorological conditions, ocean influence, and social economy. In addition, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) method was used to obtain the weights of the selected indicators, and a fuzzy logic model was constructed to obtain the result. The result showed that the spatial distribution of the EV grades was regular, while the fuzzy membership of EV decreased gradually from the coastline to inland area, especially around the river crossing, where it had the lowest EV. Along the coastline, the dikes had an obviously protective effect for the inner area, while the EV was higher in the area where no dikes were built. This result also showed that the soil condition and groundwater status were highly related to the EV spatially, with the correlation coefficients -0.55 and -0.74 respectively, and human activities had exerted considerable pressure on the ecological environment.","[Wu, Chunsheng; Liu, Gaohuan; Huang, Chong; Liu, Qingsheng; Guan, Xudong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Liu, GH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",wuchsh0118@163.com; liugh@lreis.ac.cn; huangch@lreis.ac.cn; liuqs@lreis.ac.cn; guanxd@lreis.ac.cn,"Wu, Chunsheng/HTN-5460-2023","wu, chunsheng/0000-0002-5940-1293; Guan, XuDong/0000-0003-0030-2335","National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFD0300403]; National Natural Science Foundation Committee of China [41661144030, 41561144012]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation Committee of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Authors thank supports through the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2017YFD0300403 and the International Cooperation Projects from National Natural Science Foundation Committee of China: Impact of Climate and Land Use Change on Water Quantity and Water Quality in the Mun River Basin under Grant 41661144030 and Study on Water Resources Change and Adaptive Management in the Great Mekong River Basin under Grant 41561144012.,,45,41,42,5,58,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

In a context in which the primary focus of management literature, especially of North American origin, concerns the concept and practices of social entrepreneurship, this paper explores the experiences of European social enterprises and in particular of Italian social cooperatives. Social cooperatives are experimenting with initiatives capable of responding to the emergence of new needs and changes in society in a sustainable way. Based on an analysis of the experience of various social cooperatives operating in the field of renewable energy sources, tourism, and the use of assets confiscated from the Mafia, this paper aims to highlight how social enterprise manages to create contexts of sustainable development, thereby building interorganizational and intersectoral collaborative networks aimed at the activation of new paths for local development. This represents evidence of the specific nature of the social enterprise, which is able to establish a number of coordination mechanisms. It creates new businesses with public and private, and profit and non-profit partners, with the aim of achieving a stated goal, or enters into contractual arrangements, in order to establish business partnerships and build entire local manufacturing supply chains. In this way social enterprise promotes interaction between resources of a public, market and community nature.","[Picciotti, Antonio] Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Picciotti, A (corresponding author), Univ Perugia, Perugia, Italy.",antonio.picciotti@unipg.it,,,,,,,72,41,41,3,120,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

DF cases were clustered in the Pearl River Delta economic zone (PRD) in Guangdong Province, which accounted for 99.6% of all cases in Guangdong province in 2013. The main vector in PRD was Aedes albopictus. We investigated the socioeconomic and environmental factors at the township level and explored how the independent variables jointly affect the DF epidemic in the PRD. Methodology/Principal Findings Six factors associated with the incidence of DF were identified in this project, representing the urbanization, poverty, accessibility and vegetation, and were considered to be core contributors to the occurrence of DF from the perspective of the social economy and the environment. Analyses were performed with Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to fit parametric and non-parametric functions to the relationships between the response and predictors. We used a spline-smooth technique and plotted the predicted against the observed co-variable value. The distribution of DF cases was over-dispersed and fit the negative binomial function better. The effects of all six socioeconomic and environmental variables were found to be significant at the 0.001 level and the model explained 45.1% of the deviance by DF incidence. There was a higher risk of DF infection among people living at the prefectural boundary or in the urban areas than among those living in other areas in the PRD. The relative risk of living at the prefectural boundary was higher than that of living in the urban areas. The associations between the DF cases and population density, GDP per capita, road density, and NDVI were nonlinear. In general, higher road density or lower GDP per capita were considered to be consistent risk factors. Moreover, higher or lower values of population density and NDVI could result in an increase in DF cases. Conclusion In this study, we presented an effect analysis of socioeconomic and environmental factors on DF occurrence at the smallest administrative unit (township level) for the first time in China. GAM was used to effectively detect the nonlinear impact of the predictors on the outcome. The results showed that the relative importance of different risk factors may vary across the PRD. This work improves our understanding of the differences and effects of socioeconomic and environmental factors on DF and supports effectively targeted prevention and control measures.","[Qi, Xiaopeng; Li, Yue; Meng, Yujie; Chen, Qianqian; Ma, Jiaqi] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Publ Hlth Surveillance & Informat Serv, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Gao, George F.] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Off Director, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Center for Disease Control & Prevention","Qi, XP (corresponding author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Publ Hlth Surveillance & Informat Serv, Beijing, Peoples R China.",qixp@chinacdc.cn; gaofu@chinacdc.cn,"li, yao/IYJ-1364-2023; Liu, Xiangyan/JTV-4868-2023; Gao, George Fu/ABD-5229-2021","Wang, Yong/0000-0002-0821-6549",National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) [2012CB955504]; High Resolution Earth Observation Systems of National Science and Technology Major Projects [10-Y30B11-9001-14/16]; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology [2012 ZX10004201-011],"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(National Basic Research Program of China); High Resolution Earth Observation Systems of National Science and Technology Major Projects; Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","This study was supported in part by National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (2012CB955504), the High Resolution Earth Observation Systems of National Science and Technology Major Projects (10-Y30B11-9001-14/16) and the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (2012 ZX10004201-011).

As one of the services for elderly people, the concessionary bus travel programme provides a kind of social welfare for elderly people, while peak-hour traffic pressures (e.g., traffic congestion, traffic injuries, and travel discomfort) faced by elderly people have been ignored. This paper attempts to help society create a better travel environment for elderly people by analysing their travel behaviours. Specifically, using household survey data from Beijing, the statistical analysis is used to paint a more detailed picture of daily travel experience of elderly people with regard to departure times, travel purposes, travel mode choices, etc. Then, a nested logit model is employed to interpret travel patterns of elderly people. The results show that the bus plays the most important role in motorized travel of elderly people. Furthermore, the free bus programme has induced only 4.85% of bus travel among elderly people, indicating that the programme has little effect on elderly people's bus choices. Based on the results of the analysis, several options are proposed in this paper to help society adapt to the changing demographics.","[Zhang, Yongsheng; Yao, Enjian; Zhang, Rui] Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, 3 Shangyuancun, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Xu, Hao] Univ Nevada, Dept Civil & Environm Engn, 1664 N Virginia St,MS 258, Reno, NV 89557 USA",Beijing Jiaotong University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Yao, EJ (corresponding author), Beijing Jiaotong Univ, Sch Traff & Transportat, 3 Shangyuancun, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",zys8303@gmail.com; enjyao@bjtu.edu.cn; 13114247@bjtu.edu.cn; haox@unr.edu,"Xu, Hao Ran/JED-9378-2023; xu, haodong/IAM-9132-2023; xu, hao/GWQ-7394-2022",,Beijing Natural Science Foundation [8171003],Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),"This research is supported by Beijing Natural Science Foundation (grant number 8171003), China.",,29,40,46,18,83,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-6923,1873-1236,,J TRANSP GEOGR,J.

Speaking to debates about alterity, diverse economies (Gibson-Graham, 2008) and emerging literature on the circular and shared economy, these two small and informal based models, one food based, the other clothing, are put forward as examples of the vast array of contemporary 'alternative' forms of consumption and provisioning taking place across the UK. The article illuminates how diverse economies are 'made material' through their materials and practices. In doing so I make three key arguments: firstly, and overall, that studying materiality is one way to illuminate these new and emerging spaces of provisioning, highlighting their practices, intimacies and ambiguities. Secondly, this material focus illustrates how the practices of provisioning - in particular, sharing and circulating - are not new, but are instead organised in original and novel ways; and this has wider implications for contemporary debates on circular and shared economy. Thirdly, that the materials of provisioning can be both beneficial and troublesome to provisioning organisations' practices of circulating and sharing and the extent to which they tackle issues of social exclusion, financial hardship and sustainable resource use.","[Holmes, Helen] Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Scoiol, 188 Waterloo Pl,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Holmes, H (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sustainable Consumpt Inst, Scoiol, 188 Waterloo Pl,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",Helen.Holmes@manchester.ac.uk,,"Holmes, Helen/0000-0002-4918-2007","University of Manchester, Hallsworth Fellowship Fund","University of Manchester, Hallsworth Fellowship Fund","This research was funded by the University of Manchester, Hallsworth Fellowship Fund.

Policy-making and management in coastal development also need an in-depth understanding of long term land use changes. Historically, coastal land use and its policy in China experienced a complex and tortuous evolution from the preindustrial era to modern times. However, there is a lack of detailed treatment in previous studies, about the issues of the policy response to environmental and social-economic conditions. Using an approach of historical document analysis and multidisciplinary synthesis, based on the case from the Jiangsu coast, we explore the land use changes and its policy response for China's mainland coasts on a centennial time scale. The results show that the land use policy had different performances in response to the changes of environment and social-economy at different stages, with a dynamic shift from passive to active response. During the 18-19th centuries, the management framework was associated with the monopolized land use policy that was dominated by the government's interests of salt industry; there were few initiatives to take into account the environment changes and stakeholder conflicts. Yet, during the 20th century, the emphasis of the policy was placed on reclamation and diversified industry, reflecting the pressure from the coastal environment change and social-economic situation. At the same time, the adjustment of land use policy became more frequent. Population growth and physical environment change are the two major driving forces for the observed shifts.

This study evaluates changes in meteorological factors (e.g., precipitation, air temperature, and snowfall) and corresponding responses in the hydrological regime under future climate change scenarios in both the TP and the downstream areas. The Lancang River basin (LRB), located in the southeast TP and known as the upper Mekong River basin, is selected as the case study area. Future climate change projections are derived from five independent GCMs of CMIP5 and their multi-model ensemble. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) distributed hydrological model is used to generate streamflow projections in future scenarios. Results show that precipitation and air temperature in both the lower LRB (representing the downstream area of TP) and upper LRB (representing the area in TP) are expected to increase substantially in the future, with higher increments in air temperature found in the upper LRB under high-emission scenarios. Snowfall, snow water equivalent (SWE), and snowmelt are commonly found to decrease with increasing air temperature, and the snow melt time tends to be earlier. Significantly increasing mean and extreme streamflow caused by increasing precipitation are anticipated in the future. The low flow shows much higher relative increments at the upstream of TP, which is mainly caused by changes in snow regulating (decreased snowfall and earlier snowmelt). However, those effects show weak influence on the streamflow in the downstream area, which would be more largely impact by the local precipitation change. In the future, irrigation, hydropower, and navigation in the TP could benefit from increased low flow in the TP, but the consistently increasing extreme high flow may indicate greater flood risk in the TP and downstream areas.","[Chen, Xiaohong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Water Resources & Environm Res, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Chen, XH (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Ctr Water Resources & Environm Res, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",eescxh@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0405900]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [91547202, 51479216, 51509127]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The research is financially supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC0405900) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.: 91547202, 51479216 and 51509127).",,90,39,41,5,154,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0169-8095,1873-2895,,ATMOS RES,Atmos.

How to effectively solve environmental problems and prevent further deterioration of the environment have attracted tremendous attention from scholars. In recent years, big data, that is, an enormous volume of data, have developed rapidly and widely and have brought major challenges as well as unprecedented opportunities to the world. For example, big data can be used to predict production processes more accurately. However, they make traditional environmental performance evaluation methods ineffective. Thus, studying and improving environmental efficiency evaluation under the background of big data are important to increase environmental efficiency apart from pushing forward discipline development. This study presents a set of scientific and axiomatised methods for environmental performance evaluation based on the big data environment.

People are beginning to realize that these problems not only affect the ecological environment, but also hinder the development of the organic polymer material industry based on raw fossil materials. Therefore, the modification and application of bio-based materials are of theoretical and practical significance. In this study, a series of vegetable oil-based acrylate prepolymers were synthesized by one-step acrylation using palm oil, olive oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, canola oil, and grapeseed oil as raw materials, and the effect of different double bond contents on the product structure and grafting rate was investigated. Furthermore, the as-prepared vegetable oil-based acrylate prepolymers, polyurethane acrylate (PUA-2665), trimethylolpropane triacrylate (TMPTA), and photoinitiator (PI-1173) were mixed thoroughly to prepare ultraviolet (UV)-curable films. The effect of different grafting numbers on the properties of these films was investigated. The results showed that as the degree of unsaturation increased, the acrylate grafting number and the cross-linking density increased, although the acrylation (grafting reaction) rate decreased. The reason was mainly because increasing the double bond content could accelerate the reaction rate, while the grafted acrylic groups had a steric hindrance effect to prevent the adjacent double bonds from participating in the reaction. Furthermore, the increase in grafting number brought about the increase in the structural functionality of prepolymers and the cross-linking density of cured films, which led to the enhancement in the thermal (glass transition temperature) and mechanical (tensile strength, Young's modulus) properties of the cured films.","[Su, Yupei; Lin, Hai; Zhang, Shuting; Yang, Zhuohong; Yuan, Teng] South China Agr Univ, Coll Mat & Energy, Guangdong Lab Lingnan Modern Agr Sci & Technol, Key Lab Biobased Mat & Energy,Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China; [Yuan, Teng] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China",South China Agricultural University; Hong Kong Polytechnic University,"Yang, ZH; Yuan, T (corresponding author), South China Agr Univ, Coll Mat & Energy, Guangdong Lab Lingnan Modern Agr Sci & Technol, Key Lab Biobased Mat & Energy,Minist Educ, Guangzhou 510642, Peoples R China.;Yuan, T (corresponding author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong 999077, Peoples R China.",suyupei@stu.scau.edu.cn; linhai@stu.scau.edu.cn; stzhang@scau.edu.cn; yangzhuohong@scau.edu.cn; yuant@scau.edu.cn,,"Yuan, Teng/0000-0003-1114-7895","National Natural Science Foundation of China [21808070, 51673075]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2018A030310349]; Science & Technology Program of Guangzhou City [201803030003, 201704030085]; Research Fund Program of Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Green Chemical Product Technology [GC201813]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); Science & Technology Program of Guangzhou City; Research Fund Program of Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Green Chemical Product Technology,"This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21808070, 51673075); the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (2018A030310349); the Science & Technology Program of Guangzhou City (201803030003, 201704030085); and the Research Fund Program of Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Green Chemical Product Technology (GC201813).",,42,38,40,4,63,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4360,,POLYMERS-BASEL,Polymers,MAY,2020,12,5,,,,,,,1165,10.3390/polym12051165,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym12051165,,,13,Polymer Science,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Polymer Science,LZ7VT,32438660,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000541431100170,View Full Record in Web of Science

As a further generalization of hesitant fuzzy set (HFS), simplified neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set (SNHFS) is an efficient tool to process the vague information and contains the ideas of a single-valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set (SVNHFS) and an interval neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set (INHFS). In this paper, we propose a decision-making approach based on the maximizing deviation method and TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) to solve the MADM problems, in which the attribute weight information is incomplete, and the decision information is expressed in simplified neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy elements. Firstly, we inaugurate an optimization model on the basis of maximizing deviation method, which is useful to determine the attribute weights. Secondly, using the idea of the TOPSIS, we determine the relative closeness coefficient of each alternative and based on which we rank the considered alternatives to select the optimal one(s). Finally, we use a numerical example to show the detailed implementation procedure and effectiveness of our method in solving MADM problems under simplified neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy environment.","[Akram, Muhammad] Univ Punjab, Dept Math, New Campus, Lahore 54590, Pakistan; [Naz, Sumera] Govt Coll Women Univ Faisalabad, Dept Math, Punjab 38000, Pakistan; [Smarandache, Florentin] Univ New Mexico Math, Sci Dept, 705 Gurley Ave, Gallup, NM 87301 USA",University of Punjab,"Akram, M (corresponding author), Univ Punjab, Dept Math, New Campus, Lahore 54590, Pakistan.",m.akram@pucit.edu.pk,"Smarandache, Florentin/K-3160-2013; Akram, Muhammad/N-3369-2014","Smarandache, Florentin/0000-0002-5560-5926; Akram, Muhammad/0000-0001-7217-7962",,,,,31,38,38,1,13,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-8994,,SYMMETRY-BASEL,Symmetry-Basel,AUG,2019,11,8,,,,,,,1058,10.3390/sym11081058,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym11081058,,,26,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,IU4LT,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000483559300102,View Full Record in Web of Science

To cope within these issues, urban food systems need to become more sustainable in their practices, as well as resilient in the face of extreme weather events. While scholars have started to investigate this topic, no comprehensive analysis has yet addressed what entails sustainable and resilient urban food systems. Through a systematic review of the literature, this paper aims to improve our understanding of the key components of sustainable and resilient urban food systems. This study reviewed 53 publications and identified components related to the health, social, economy, environment, and governance domains. Only 5 of the works included in the review discussed sustainability and resilience to the impacts of climate change in urban food systems simultaneously, so there is an opportunity for original research and analysis. The most frequently identified components of urban food systems relate to: access to healthy food; connectivity between urban and rural areas; having a strong local food economy and food production; reducing food waste; and, having active participation of all actors in decision making. There is some level of consensus on linking sustainability and resilience, but diversity in food sources and the development of social capabilities need to be emphasised for climate change adaptation.

J,"Palriwala, R; Neetha, N",,,,"Palriwala, Rajni; Neetha, N.",,,Stratified Familialism: The Care Regime in India through the Lens of Childcare,DEVELOPMENT AND CHANGE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article explores the political and social economy of care in India through a focus on childcare practices, from the viewpoint of the care giver a perspective frequently ignored or touched on only generally in earlier discussions on development or social policy. It is argued that the care regime is an ad hoc summation of informal, stratified practices. It is shaped by the institutional context, in particular the economic and social inequalities of work and livelihoods, as well as trends and absences in state economic and social policy. Central to the dynamics of care practices in India is the ideology of gendered familialism in public discourse and policy, which reiterates care as a familial and female responsibility and works to devalue and diminish the dimensions of care. By delineating the range of institutions through which everyday childcare practices are organized, this contribution draws out the differentiations and actualities of stratified familialism and care. At one end of the spectrum are those who have the possibility to retain familial carers at home and supplement them with paid and other institutional carers; at the other are those who are neither able to retain family members at home nor fill the care gap through formal institutions.","[Palriwala, Rajni] Univ Delhi, Dept Sociol, Delhi Sch Econ, Delhi 110007, India",University of Delhi; Delhi School of Economics,"Palriwala, R (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Dept Sociol, Delhi Sch Econ, Delhi 110007, India.",rajnip@gmail.com; neethapil-lai@gmail.com,,,,,,,76,38,39,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0012-155X,1467-7660,,DEV CHANGE,Dev.

The second entry point is a review of feminists' search for alternatives to mainstream economics and global development processes with calls for a transition to place-based socio-economic practices built on the ethics of care, gender justice, the centrality of social reproduction and community livelihoods.

Existing time-series models have limited prediction accuracy when faced with the characteristics of nonlinearity and nonstationarity in complex situations related to energy and finance. To enhance overall prediction capabilities and improve forecasting accuracy, in this article we propose a fuzzy interval time-series forecasting model on the basis of network-based multiple time-frequency spaces and the induced-ordered weighted averaging aggregation (IOWA) operation. Specifically, a time-series signal is decomposed into ensemble empirical modes and then reconstructed as various time-frequency spaces, which are transformed into visibility graphs. Then, forecasting intervals in different spaces can be collected after the local random walker link prediction model is adopted. Furthermore, a rule-based representation value function inspired by Yager's golden rule approach is defined, and an appropriate representation value is calculated. Finally, after IOWA is used to aggregate the forecasting outcomes in different time-frequency spaces, the final forecast value can be obtained from the fuzzy forecasting interval. Considering that energy issues are of widespread interest in nature and the social economy, two cases, based on a hydrological time series from the Biliuhe River in China and two well-knownsets of financial time-series data, Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index and Hang Seng Index, are studied to test the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with existing models. Our results show that the proposed approach can achieve better performance than well-developed models.","[Liu, Gang; Xiao, Fuyuan] Southwest Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China; [Lin, Chin-Teng] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Artificial Intelligence, Fac Engn & IT, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Cao, Zehong] La Trobe Univ, Dept Comp Sci & Informat Technol, Bundoora, Vic 3086, Australia; [Cao, Zehong] Univ Tasmania, Discipline ICI, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",Southwest University - China; University of Technology Sydney; La Trobe University; University of Tasmania,"Xiao, FY (corresponding author), Southwest Univ, Sch Comp & Informat Sci, Chongqing 400715, Peoples R China.",lg645187984@email.swu.edu.cn; xiaofuyuan@swu.edu.cn; Chin-Teng.Lin@uts.edu.au; zehong.cao@utas.edu.au,"Cao, Zehong/O-7351-2016; Xiao, Fuyuan/AAH-6140-2020; Lin, Chin-Teng (CT)/G-8129-2017","Cao, Zehong/0000-0003-3656-0328; Lin, Chin-Teng (CT)/0000-0001-8371-8197; Liu, Gang/0000-0003-4204-731X",Research Project of Education and Teaching Reform in Southwest University [2019JY053]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [XDJK2019C085]; Chongqing Overseas Scholars Innovation Program [cx2018077],Research Project of Education and Teaching Reform in Southwest University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Chongqing Overseas Scholars Innovation Program,"This work was supported in part by the Research Project of Education and Teaching Reform in Southwest University under Grant 2019JY053, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities under Grant XDJK2019C085, and in part by the Chongqing Overseas Scholars Innovation Program under Grant cx2018077.",,98,36,38,5,88,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1063-6706,1941-0034,,IEEE T FUZZY SYST,IEEE Trans.

Supplier is the source of chain, thus selecting excellent low-carbon supplier is the foundation of establishing efficient low-carbon supply chain. This paper presents a novel hybrid model for supplier selection integrated factor analysis (FA), data envelopment analysis (DEA), with analytic hierarchy process (AHP), namely FA-DEA-AHP. First, an evaluation index system is built, incorporating product level, qualification, cooperation ability, and environmental competitiveness. FA is utilized to extract common factors from the 18 pre-selected indicators. Then, DEA is applied to establish the pairwise comparison matrix and AHP is employed to rank these low-carbon suppliers comprehensively and calculate the validity of the decision-making units. Finally, an experiment study with seven cement suppliers in a large industrial enterprise is carried out in this paper. The results reveal that the proposed technique can not only select effective suppliers, but also realize a comprehensive ranking. This research has enriched the methodology of low-carbon supplier evaluation and selection, as well as owns theoretical value in exploring the coordinated development of low-carbon supply chain to some extent.","[He, Xiangshuo] North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ Management, Baoding 071003, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jian] Agr Univ Hebei, Coll Informat Sci & Technol, Baoding 071001, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University; Hebei Agricultural University,"He, XS (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Dept Econ Management, Baoding 071003, Peoples R China.",hexiangshuo@ncepu.edu.cn; kongweiyi@hebau.edu.cn,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2016MS161],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),This work is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Project No. 2016MS161).,,34,36,36,9,77,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2018,10,2,,,,,,,564,10.3390/su10020564,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10020564,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FX3BB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000425943100287,View Full Record in Web of Science

With the introduction of social entrepreneurship as a new discipline within the wider ethics and social education banner, this pedagogic study explores the effectiveness of social business plan teaching in inducing social and civic awareness and intentionality among business school students. This is compared with the case study approach that is traditionally used within the classroom environment. Our study found that both approaches can be successful in raising awareness and improving the attitudes of participating students, increasing the probability that they will support socially oriented initiatives immediately or in the future. Interestingly, many students who participated in SBP teaching develop a local awareness of social and civic matters, while many of those who participated in case study learning develop a wider national and international perspective. In addition, it is found that many of those who participated in SBP development develop a deeper managerial and technical understanding of managing organizations within the social economy.","[Kwong, Caleb C.

Most of these consequences are caused by the new proliferation of toxin-producing non-siliceous algae. In this study, we propose a multi-objective reservoir operation model based on 10-day time scale for estuarine eutrophication control to reduce the potential non-siliceous algae outbreak. This model takes the hydropower generation and social economy water requirement in reservoir into consideration, minimizing the ICEP (indicator of estuarine eutrophication potential) as an ecological objective. Three modem multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied to solve the proposed reservoir operation model. The Three Gorges Reservoir and its operation effects on the Yangtze Estuary were chosen as a case study. The performances of these three algorithms were evaluated through a diagnostic assessment framework of modem MOEAs' abilities. The results showed that the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition with differential evolution operator (MOEA/D-DE) achieved the best performance for the operation model. It indicates that single implementation of hydrological management cannot make effective control of potential estuarine eutrophication, while combined in-estuary TP concentration control and reservoir optimal operation is a more realistic, crucial and effective strategy for controlling eutrophication potential of non-siliceous algae proliferation. Under optimized operation with controlled TP concentration and estuarine water withdrawal of 1470 m(3)/s, ecological satiety rate for estuarine drinking water source increased to 77.78%, 88.89% and 83.33% for wet, normal and dry years, the corresponding values in practical operation were only 72.22%, 58.33% and 55.56%, respectively. The results suggest that these operations will not negatively affect the economic and social interests. Therefore, the proposed integrated management approaches can provide guidance for water managers to reach a stable trophic control of estuarine waters.","[Yu, Yang; Wang, Peifang; Wang, Chao; Wang, Xun] Hohai Univ, Coll Environm, 1 Rd Xikang, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yang; Wang, Peifang; Wang, Chao; Wang, Xun] Hohai Univ, Key Lab Integrated Regulat & Resource Dev Shallow, Minist Educ, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Hohai University; Hohai University,"Wang, PF (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Coll Environm, 1 Rd Xikang, Nanjing 210098, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pfwang2005@hhu.edu.cn,"zhang, yueqi/JXM-4287-2024; Wang, Chao/GXF-8353-2022",,"National Science Funds for Creative Research Groups of China [51421006]; National Key Plan for Research and Development of China [2016YFC0502203]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51479065, 91647206]; PAPD",National Science Funds for Creative Research Groups of China(Science Fund for Creative Research Groups); National Key Plan for Research and Development of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); PAPD,"We are grateful for the grants for Project supported by the National Science Funds for Creative Research Groups of China (No.51421006), the Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 91647206), the National Key Plan for Research and Development of China (2016YFC0502203), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51479065) and PAPD.",,61,35,37,4,99,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,LONDON,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",0301-4797,1095-8630,,J ENVIRON MANAGE,J.

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 60 restaurateurs located in a small Italian city and 100 owners of micro and small-sized farms, located within a 30 km radius from the city, have been interviewed. The collected data have been analysed through descriptive analysis and Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests for differences between gender, production type and business size. Findings - The results agree with existing literature: poor communication and an unstructured logistics limit the interaction among actors. However, significant for the purpose, the data show that producers are interested in expanding their market and restaurateurs are interested in a broader supply of local products, and they both open to a logistics service that improves the supply of local food. Research limitations/implications - The following exploratory study is based on a sample of farmers and restaurants in a specific area so the results could not be generalised in a national/international context. Practical implications - The logistics service objective is the promotion of a sustainable territory development in support of the social economy values. Originality/value - The study investigates this issue focussing on a practical solution of local food distribution system among restaurants. The logistics service tends to solve the logistics criticalities maintaining the principles of the short food supply chain.","[Paciarotti, Claudia; Torregiani, Francesco] Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University,"Torregiani, F (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Marche, Dept Ind Engn & Math Sci, Ancona, Italy.",f.torregiani@pm.univpm.it,,,,,,,43,35,36,3,49,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0007-070X,1758-4108,,BRIT FOOD J,Br.

However, the relationship between three urban growth modes and their driving factors remains little investigated. To better address these problems and understand the general spatiotemporal dynamics of the urban landscape, the authors quantitatively analyzed the patterns of three urban growth modes in four metropolitan cities in China (i.e.,Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou) during a 20-year period through an integrated approach of remote sensing and landscape expansion index (LEI). The relationship between urban growth modes and three driving factors (i.e.,city center, existing urban areas, and main roads) in each city was also investigated using buffering analysis and the area-weighted mean distance index (AWMDI). Results showed that these four cities had a significant increase of urban areas and developed different urban growth patterns. Despite different natural environments and social economy, the urban growth modes of four cities exhibit a common feature that edge expansion nearly dominated the growth mode during the study periods, indicating the urban growth across these cities tends to be the phase of coalescence. Besides, from the variations in the growth density (GD)-distance curves, each growth mode of the four cities generally showed exponential attenuation with the distance to existing urban areas and roads in each period, except for the outlying growth, which showed a stochastic and scattered pattern away from the city center and existing urban areas. Results from the AWMDI in each city also suggested that existing urban areas have a generally stronger effect on infilling growth than roads, whereas roads were a stronger attractor of outlying growth than existing urban areas. The findings of this study show an improved understanding of urban growth modes and help to provide an effective way for urban planning management.","[Ou, Jinpei; Liu, Xiaoping; Li, Xia; Chen, Yimin; Li, Jun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, 135 West Xingang Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Ou, Jinpei; Liu, Xiaoping; Li, Xia; Chen, Yimin; Li, Jun] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Liu, XP (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, 135 West Xingang Rd, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.;Liu, XP (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangdong Key Lab Urbanizat & Geosimulat, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",liuxp3@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"LI, Xia/A-1235-2013; Li, Jun/AAD-7233-2020; li, xia/HHZ-7468-2022; Chen, Yimin/H-1565-2011","LI, Xia/0000-0003-3050-8529; Li, Jun/0000-0003-1613-9448; , Jinpei/0000-0001-7590-9874; Chen, Yimin/0000-0003-1976-6041",National Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars [41322009]; Key National Natural Science Foundation of China [41531176]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371376],National Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars; Key National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the National Science Fund for Excellent Young Scholars (Grant No. 41322009), the Key National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41531176), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41371376).",,56,35,37,3,103,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,RESTON,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",0733-9488,1943-5444,,J URBAN PLAN DEV,J.

Thus, changes in HWs under a warming climate have triggered extensive interests. In this study, the authors developed a new method to identify the HW events in China by double thresholds and further classified them into four categories (i.e., mild, moderate, severe, and extreme HWs) according to their magnitudes by using the daily maximum temperature data from 701 observation stations. On this basis, the spatiotemporal features of HWs with different severities in China from 1961 to 2015 were investigated. The results show that the high HW frequency mainly appears in Jianghuai, South China and western Northwest China. Moreover, the high frequencies of moderate, severe, and extreme HWs occur from June to August and reach the peak in July, while the mild HW frequency is compared from May to September. Since the 1960s, the frequencies of the mild, moderate, severe, and extreme HWs in China have increased significantly with rates of 7.5, 4.3, 1.4, and 1.8 events per year, respectively. The increases are the greatest in July for the moderate, severe, and extreme HWs while comparable during May to September for the mild HW. Besides, an interdecadal change is found to occur in the late 1990s. Compared with the former period (1961-1996), the occurrence of the extreme HWs during the latter period (1997-2015) has increased most significantly in eastern Northwest China and North China, while the frequency of the mild HWs increases most significantly in Jianghuai and South China.","[Xie, Wenxin; Zhou, Botao; Ullah, Safi] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [Xie, Wenxin; Zhou, Botao] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [You, Qinglong] Fudan Univ, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [You, Qinglong] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuqing] Huaiyin Normal Univ, Sch Urban & Environm Sci, Huaian 223300, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Fudan University; Fudan University; Huaiyin Normal University,"Zhou, BT (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.;Zhou, BT (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Sch Atmospher Sci, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",zhoubt@nuist.edu.cn,"Ullah, Safi/X-6228-2019","Ullah, Safi/0000-0002-2328-8321; zhou, Botao/0000-0002-5995-2378","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2018YFA0606301, 2016YFA0600701]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41991285, 41675069]; Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST [2018r060]; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST; National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals,"This research was jointly supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFA0606301 and 2016YFA0600701), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41991285 and 41675069), the Startup Foundation for Introducing Talent of NUIST (2018r060), and the National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals.",,59,34,35,5,42,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

This growth in interest is occurring within a global environment that is calling for a more holistic understanding of development compared to traditionally economic-centric conceptions. While regional development policies and practices have long considered for-profit businesses as agents for regional growth, there is a relatively limited understanding of the role of the social economy as a development actor. The institutional environment is a large determinant of all kinds of entrepreneurial activity, and therefore understanding the relationships between the social economy and broader regional development processes is warranted. This paper moves beyond suggestions of an economic-centric focus of regional development by utilizing institutional logics as a theoretical framework for understanding the role of social enterprises in regional development. A multiple case study of ten social enterprises in two regional locations in Australia suggests that social enterprises can represent competing logics to economic-centric institutional values and systems. The paper argues that dominant institutional logics can promote or constrain the inter-play between the social and the economic aspects of development, in the context of social enterprises.","[Barth, Sharine; Luke, Belinda] Queensland Univ Technol, Australian Ctr Philanthropy & Nonprofit Studies, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Barraket, Jo] Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Social Impact, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [McLaughlin, Juliana] Queensland Univ Technol, Oodgeroo Unit, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Melbourne Genomics Health Alliance; Swinburne University of Technology; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Barth, S (corresponding author), Swinburne Univ Technol, Ctr Social Impact, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",sbarth@swin.edu.au,"Barraket, Jo/K-9522-2019; Luke, Belinda/J-1136-2012","Barraket, Jo/0000-0001-7416-6458; Luke, Belinda/0000-0003-3077-662X; McLaughlin, Juliana Mohok/0000-0002-5984-4799",,,,,125,34,34,1,44,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0898-5626,1464-5114,,ENTREP REGION DEV,Entrep.

Given that there is a good deal of policy borrowing between Australia and the United Kingdom, the stark contrast between the two countries in this policy field is puzzling. This article concludes by identifying four developments that led to this policy explosion in the United Kingdom and finds them largely missing in Australia. This leads to a conclusion that a similar range of policies are unlikely to develop here.","Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; Off Govt Commerce, London, England",University of Technology Sydney,"Lyons, M (corresponding author), Univ Technol Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",,,,,,,,43,34,35,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0313-6647,,,AUST J PUBL ADMIN,Aust.

Using the spatiotemporal distribution data of land use in Chongqing Section of Three Gorges Reservoir Area from 2001 to 2016, the response changes of carrying capacity of resources and environment under the evolution of land use structure were investigated. The analytical results showed that the suitable carrying capacity of resources and environment in Chongqing decreased first and then increased. In the early stage of the Three Gorges Project, some districts and counties exhibited the phenomenon of suitable carrying capacity deficit, especially in the northeast of Chongqing. In the main urban area of Chongqing, the suitable carrying capacity was also mainly restricted by the ecological resources conditions, the deficit was getting worse with the increase of population density. In the later stage, by restoring ecology and improving the living and economic conditions, the phenomenon of deficit was gradually alleviated. These findings will provide some references for the protection of ecological environment and the development of social economy in Chongqing Section of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area.","[Chen, Dan; Zhou, Qi-Gang; Yu, Lean] Chongqing Key Lab Spatial Data Min & Big Data Int, Chongqing 401320, Peoples R China; [Chen, Dan] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Rongzhi Coll, Chongqing 401320, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Qi-Gang] Chongqing Technol & Business Univ, Chongqing 400067, Peoples R China; [Yu, Lean] Beijing Univ Chem Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100029, Peoples R China",Chongqing Technology & Business University; Chongqing Technology & Business University; Beijing University of Chemical Technology,"Yu, LA (corresponding author), Chongqing Key Lab Spatial Data Min & Big Data Int, Chongqing 401320, Peoples R China.",yulean@amss.ac.cn,"Zhou, Qi/JTT-3417-2023; haibin, tang/JVO-0925-2024",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41101503]; Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Education Commission [KJ1719374],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Education Commission,This work is partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41101503); Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Education Commission (No. KJ1719374).

It also aims to show the positive relationship between the extent to which social entrepreneurship is implemented and the creation of distinctive marketing competences, as well as the mediating role these competences have between social entrepreneurship and organizational performance. For this purpose, an analysis of 221 Spanish social-economic entities has been developed from January to May 2014. In order to evaluate organizational performance, a validated scale has been used (Nakata, 2008), since it integrates sociometric characteristics that are necessary for this research. For the two remaining constructs, that is to say, social entrepreneurship and distinctive marketing competences, specific items have been developed by taking into consideration the analysis of their sociometric properties that could lead to the validation of the relationship among the three proposed variables. The results show a positive relationship between the extent to which an organization introduces social entrepreneurship and its organizational performance, social entrepreneurship and the creation of distinctive marketing competences, as well as the influence of distinctive marketing competences as a mediating variable in the relationship between the degree of implementation of social entrepreneurship and organizational performance.","[Palacios-Marques, Daniel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Business Adm, Valencia, Spain; [Guijarro Garcia, Maria; Marti Sanchez, Myriam] ESIC Business & Mkt Sch, Barcelona, Spain; [Alguacil Mari, Maria Pilar] Univ Valencia, Dept Taxat & Publ Financial Law, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; ESIC; ESIC Business & Marketing School; University of Valencia,"Palacios-Marqués, D (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, Dept Business Adm, Valencia, Spain.",dapamar@doe.upv.es; Maria.guijarro@esic.edu; Myriam.marti@esic.edu; pilar.alguacil@uv.es,"Marti-Sanchez, Myriam/O-8935-2018","Marti-Sanchez, Myriam/0000-0003-4344-4464",,,,,39,33,43,4,64,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0148-2963,1873-7978,,J BUS RES,J.

As a result, the findings tend to replicate and confirm rather than challenge and extend the extant knowledge and theorisations. Based on a recent study of farmers' markets in the Czech capital Prague, the paper claims that viewing these 'from the periphery' produces novel insights complementing those garnered in researching them in the West. In the context of earlier alternative food initiatives, the boom of farmers' markets, which Prague experienced in the early 2010s, was unparalleled. In less than 24 months, 41 farmers' markets were established in and around the city. Focusing methodologically on the discourse of the organisers of farmers' markets and theoretically on the complex hidden geography underlying the farmers' markets' boom, we are able to unpick the intricacy and paradoxical nature inherent in this development. While acknowledging the farmers' markets embeddedness in the local context, we argue that a more comprehensive understanding of farmers' markets requires engagement with a flow of ideas and know-how transcending the locality. The ensuing type of farmers' markets is a result of interactions among different travelling concepts as well as of their encounter with the specificities of the local post-socialist context. We argue that the fact that these concepts were not necessarily concordant with each other and also insufficiently adapted to the local context had a profound effect on Prague farmers' markets' boom.","[Fendrychova, Lenka] Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Management, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Fendrychova, Lenka] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Social Geog & Reg Dev, Albertov 6, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Jehlicka, Petr] Open Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, Dept Geog, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; Charles University Prague; Open University - UK,"Fendrychová, L (corresponding author), Univ South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Management, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",lfendrychova@ef.jeu.cz,"Jehlicka, Petr/D-9460-2013; Jehlička, Petr/ITU-7745-2023","Jehlicka, Petr/0000-0002-7602-7133; Jehlička, Petr/0000-0002-7602-7133",SW UK Praha project - Charles University in Prague [260199]; Internal Grant Competition of the Faculty of Economics of University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice,SW UK Praha project - Charles University in Prague; Internal Grant Competition of the Faculty of Economics of University of South Bohemia in Ceske Budejovice,The work on this paper was supported by two projects.

With climate change and increasing human activities, addressing this vulnerability has become an important concern. To support this objective, we present a complex index system to analyze vulnerability at a regional scale with a 1 km x 1 km resolution. Based on the evaluation framework, which includes natural resources, the natural environment and the social economy, the results indicate that an ecosystem in a mountainous area is more vulnerable than it is in a plain. Land desertification will worsen from 2014 to 2099 under the RCP4.5 scenarios and improve slightly under the RCP8.5 and RCP2.6 scenarios, while the suitable land for agriculture increased slightly under the three scenarios. In addition, a regional sensitivity analysis of vulnerability to climate change shows that the improving region and the worsening region will occupy 1.30% and 74.51%, respectively. In view of this, the socio-ecological system will undergo a worsening trend as a whole. Finally, we simplified how to solve the problem of a socio-ecological system in the future.

Linking these two fields of research, the aim of the present work is to analyse the social capital endowments of Social Economy firms in comparison to those in traditional profit-maximizing firms. To do so, a literature review will be firstly carried out to clarify both the concept of social capital and, more specifically, its relation with entrepreneurship and social enterprises. In the empirical section, the social capital endowments both of social firms (cooperatives and owned-worker enterprises) and traditional firms are compared using data from two surveys conducted in Andalusia, a lagged Spanish region with long tradition in the Social Economy sector. Results show that social capital endowments measured through cooperation agreements and company links with local suppliers and costumers are higher in cooperatives and worker-owned companies. Therefore, Andalusian authorities must continue with its support policy to these enterprises as a mean to reinforce the regional economic development.","[Guzman, Carmen] Univ Huelva, Fac Business Sci, Dept Econ, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Bauer, Carrie M.] Arizona State Univ, Sch Social Transformat, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Santos, Francisco J.] Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ 1, Fac Business & Econ Sci, Seville 41018, Spain",Universidad de Huelva; Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; University of Sevilla,"Guzmán, C (corresponding author), Univ Huelva, Fac Business Sci, Dept Econ, Plaza Merced 11, Huelva 21071, Spain.",cmbauer1@asu.edu; carmen.guzman@dege.uhu.es; fjsantos@us.es,"Santos, Francisco J./E-8709-2010; Guzman, Carmen/I-8025-2018","Santos, Francisco J./0000-0003-4453-7048; Guzman, Carmen/0000-0002-5290-8841",,,,,41,33,37,5,85,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1554-7191,,,INT ENTREP MANAG J,Int.

The observed and projected frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation in some regions will greatly influence the social economy. The frequency of extreme precipitation and the population and economic exposure were quantified for a base period (1986-2005) and future periods (2016-2035 and 2046-2065) based on bias corrected projections of daily precipitation from five global climatic models forced with three representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and projections of population and gross domestic product (GDP) in the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The RCP8.5-SSP3 scenario produces the highest global population exposure for 2046-2065, with nearly 30% of the global population (2.97 x 10(9) persons) exposed to precipitation extremes >10 days/a. The RCP2.6-SSP1 scenario produces the highest global GDP exposure for 2046-2065, with a 5.56-fold increase relative to the base period, of up to (2.29 0.20) x 10(15) purchasing power parity $-days. Socioeconomic effects are the primary contributor to the exposure changes at the global and continental scales. Population and GDP effects account for 64-77% and 78-91% of the total exposure change, respectively. The inequality of exposure indicates that more attention should be given to Asia and Africa due to their rapid increases in population and GDP. However, due to their dense populations and high GDPs, European countries, that is, Luxembourg, Belgium, and the Netherlands, should also commit to effective adaptation measures. Plain Language Summary The risk of precipitation extremes is likely to increase with climate change. Socioeconomic exposure is the key component for assessing the risk of such events. The projections of five global climate models (GCMs), forced with three representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and projections of population and gross domestic product (GDP) in shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), were used to quantify socioeconomic exposure to precipitation extremes for a base period (1986-2005) and future periods (2016-2035 and 2046-2065). The exposure of the global population for 2046-2065 is highest under the RCP8.5-SSP3 scenario, and the global GDP exposure for 2046-2065 is highest under the RCP2.6-SSP1 scenario. Socioeconomic effects (population and GDP effects) play the main roles in the changes in exposure at both global and continental scales. Asia and Africa should be given more attention due to their rapid increases in population and GDP. However, due to their dense populations and high GDPs, European countries should also commit to effective adaptation measures. Key Points Global population and GDP exposures are highest for 2046-2065 in RCP8.5-SSP3 and RCP2.6-SSP1, 8.46 x 10(10) person-days and 2.29 x 10(15)PPP $-days Increases in population and GDP are the dominant contributors, accounting for over 60% of future changes in socioeconomic exposure Effective adaptation is urgently needed for some European countries, for example, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and in Asia and Africa","[Liu, Yujie; Chen, Jie; Pan, Tao; Liu, Yanhua; Ge, Quansheng] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yujie; Chen, Jie; Liu, Yanhua; Ge, Quansheng] Univ Chinese Acad Sci UCAS, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuhu] Capital Normal Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ciais, Philippe] UVSQ, CNRS, CEA, Lab Sci Climat & Environm IPSL,LSCE, Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Penuelas, Josep] UAB, CSIC, Global Ecol CREAF, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain; [Penuelas, Josep] CREAF, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Capital Normal University; Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Cite; CEA; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Autonomous University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigacion Ecologica y Aplicaciones Forestales (CREAF-CERCA); University of Barcelona","Liu, YJ; Pan, T; Ge, QS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Liu, YJ; Ge, QS (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci UCAS, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liuyujie@igsnrr.ac.cn; pantao@igsnrr.ac.cn; geqs@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Penuelas, Josep/D-9704-2011; Yang, Ying/ABD-2481-2022; liu, yan/HGV-1365-2022; LI, WEI/ISS-1208-2023; Ciais, Philippe/A-6840-2011; liu, yan/HCI-5542-2022; Liu, Yiming/ISU-3780-2023; liu, liu/JEO-6900-2023","Penuelas, Josep/0000-0002-7215-0150; Ciais, Philippe/0000-0001-8560-4943; Ge, Quansheng/0000-0001-8712-8565; Chen, Jie/0000-0001-7403-9942","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671037]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) [2016049]; Program for Kezhen Excellent Talents in the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR) [2017RC101]; European Research Council Synergy grant [ERC-SyG-2013-610028]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS); Program for Kezhen Excellent Talents in the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR); European Research Council Synergy grant(European Research Council (ERC))","This study was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant no. 2016YFA0602402), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant no. 41671037), the Youth Innovation Promotion Association, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) (grant no. 2016049), and the Program for Kezhen Excellent Talents in the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research (IGSNRR), (grant no. 2017RC101).

Yet, the social economy gathers very distinct organizational models which may be associated with different types and levels of social capital. Accordingly, the objective of this article is to explore whether, and if so how, the type and level of social capital differ between mutual benefit organizations - which essentially seek to meet their members' needs - and public benefit organizations - which seek to enhance the well-being of a broader community or the society as a whole. The study draws on an econometric analysis of different forms of social capital in two renewable energy cooperatives which are located in Flanders but have clearly divergent orientations toward mutual versus public benefit. The results show that, as compared with an orientation toward public benefit, an orientation toward mutual benefit is associated with lower social identification with the cooperative and weaker ties between members. Our study explores the underlying explanatory mechanisms behind these relationships. Its findings contribute to understanding the potential roles played by cooperatives in sustainability transitions.","[Bauwens, Thomas; Defourny, Jacques] Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium; [Bauwens, Thomas] Ecole Polytech Federale Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland",University of Liege,"Bauwens, T (corresponding author), Univ Liege, Liege, Belgium.;Bauwens, T (corresponding author), Ecole Polytech Federale Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.",Thomas.Bauwens@epfl.ch,,"Bauwens, Thomas/0000-0003-3462-4631; Nedanov, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4238-9275",,,,,94,32,34,1,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

The theoretical literature on social economy and sustainable local and regional development are reviewed and integrated focusing on the obstacles of sustainability and the function of social economy in local and regional development. Conflict and competition among sustainability values necessitates agreement and cooperation among those who embrace such values. Social enterprises are the core components of a social economy that reflects local and regional needs and pursues complex goals. In the social innovation process, social enterprises collaborate with various stakeholders regarding their business and social goals. Social enterprises have positive effects that influence local and regional development by satisfying local and regional needs, creating jobs in the community, developing relational assets in business processes, and restoring community solidarity. In social economy theory, social enterprises can facilitate sustainable local and regional development by including relational assets which embody social capital in social innovation processes. In the context of local and regional development, relational assets are important reinforcements of institutional capabilities, networks, and community or regional cooperation. Although social enterprises are not the dominant resources in traditional local and regional development, they can solve problems related to collective actions by networking and applying social norms to the situation.","[Kim, Donghyun] Korea Environm Inst, 370 Sicheong Daero, Sejong 30147, South Korea; [Lim, Up] Yonsei Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Korea Environment Institute (KEI); Yonsei University,"Lim, U (corresponding author), Yonsei Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",donghyunkim@kei.re.kr; uplim@yonsei.ac.kr,"Lim, Up/G-7971-2012; Kim, Donghyun/HDO-8306-2022; Kuo, Aircraft/T-5262-2017","Lim, Up/0000-0002-2590-3498; Kim, Donghyun/0000-0003-3711-5103; Kuo, Aircraft/0000-0001-8329-6801",,,,,123,31,32,9,88,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2017,9,8,,,,,,,1427,10.3390/su9081427,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su9081427,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FF3YT,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000408861800142,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the aspect ofmodel evaluation index, the correct rate of RFCN model is increased by 10%, the accuracy rate is increased by 12%, the recall rate is increased by 8%, the loss rate is increased by 3%, and the overall stability is higher. In the aspect of comprehensive performance, the picture processing performance is better than the FCN model by 7% and better than the R-CNN model by 15%, and thememory share is 80%.

Sports industry has shown great potential in improving national economy, guiding social consumption, and adjusting industrial structure. However, compared with the rapid development of sports industry, the research on the growth law of sports culture industry is relatively backward, which largely restricts the further development of China's sports industry. For this problem, this paper analyzes the feasibility of sports culture industry growth prediction based on big data theory from the perspective of data mining, proposes a sports culture industry growth prediction model based on genetic neural network, and realizes the prediction of sports culture industry growth law under the background of big data. The simulation result shows that the optimized neural network can effectively improve the efficiency and accuracy of prediction and show strong robust in predicting the laws of sports culture industry.","[Yang, Ke] Xihua Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Chengdu 610039, Peoples R China",Xihua University,"Yang, K (corresponding author), Xihua Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Chengdu 610039, Peoples R China.",yangke777777@163.com,,,,,,,45,30,30,9,81,SPRINGER LONDON LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1617-4909,1617-4917,,PERS UBIQUIT COMPUT,Pers.

The fluorescent characteristics of dissolved organic matter (FDOM) has been widely used to trace CDOM sources and infer its composition. However, little is known about the optical and fluorescent properties of CDOM in drinking water reservoirs, and the variability of CDOM properties along trophic gradients in these aquatic systems. A total of 536 water samples were collected between 2015 and 2017 from 131 reservoirs across China to characterize CDOM and FDOM properties using both light absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, and examine relationships with water-quality condition as expressed by the modified trophic state index (TSIM) of the reservoirs (range: 12 < TSIM < 78). With increased reservoir trophic status, CDOM absorption coefficients at 254 nm (a(CDOM)(254)) and total fluorescence of FRI-EEMs (excitation-emission matrix coupled with fluorescence regional integration) increased significantly (p < 0.01). Our results indicated that the nutrients in aquatic systems and the social economy factors (including wastewater, sewage, cultivated land, GDP, population) and altitude affect the CDOM absorption and fluorescence significantly (p < 0.05). Most importantly, we proposed a new classification standard associated with eutrophic status via CDOM humification index (HIX) due to the significant correlation between each other (p < 0.01). HIX less than 4 was corresponding to TSIM less than 30 as oligotrophic states; 4 < HIX <= 12 was corresponding to TSIM less than 50 as mesotrophic states; 12 < HIX <= 18 was corresponding to TSIM less than 70 as eutrophic states; HIX more than 18 is defined as hypereutrophic status with TSIM > 70. This method highlights the importance of CDOM fluorescence for aquatic DOM input and strengthens the linkage between the trophic status index and CDOM characteristics, it also contributes to establish a new rapid assessing model with quick experimental measurements to monitor the trophic status of water reservoirs.","[Shang, Yingxin; Song, Kaishan; Wen, Zhidan; Lyu, Lili; Fang, Chong; Liu, Ge] Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Jacinthe, Pierre A.] Indiana Univ Purdue Univ, Dept Earth Sci, Indianapolis, IN 46202 USA; [Song, Kaishan] Liaocheng Univ, Sch Environm & Planning, Liaocheng 252000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Shang, Yingxin; Fang, Chong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Northeast Institute of Geography & Agroecology, CAS; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; Liaocheng University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Song, KS (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Northeast Inst Geog & Agroecol, Changchun 130102, Jilin, Peoples R China.",shangyingxin@neigae.ac.cn; songkaishan@iga.ac.cn; pjacinth@iupui.edu; wenzhidan@neigae.ac.cn; lvlili@neigae.ac.cn; fangchong@neigae.ac.cn; liuge@neigae.ac.cn,"Shen, Feilong/GSN-7343-2022",,"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19070501]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41730104, 41471293]; project of Science and Technology Development plan of Jilin Province of China [20170301001NY]; Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); project of Science and Technology Development plan of Jilin Province of China; Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This research was jointly supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA19070501), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41730104 and 41471293), and project of Science and Technology Development plan of Jilin Province of China (20170301001NY) and the Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences through a grant to Dr. Kaishan Song.

In this study, we use the 95th percentile-based threshold to define extreme precipitation. The spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation and temperature-extreme precipitation scaling relationship between dry and wet regions of mainland China during 1961-2014 are analyzed using two gridded data sets of precipitation and temperature observations. Extreme precipitation increased faster in dry regions (3.9% frequency and 2.8% relative intensity per decade) compared to wet regions (2.5% frequency and 2.1% relative intensity per decade) over the past 54 years. Despite the negative regression relationship between mean precipitation and temperature in wet regions, extreme precipitation has a positive relationship with temperature. The regression coefficient in relative intensity against temperature change is 6% per degrees C in wet regions. The frequency increases significantly (p < 0.01) faster as temperature increases in wet regions (11.1% per degrees C) compared with dry regions (6.9% per degrees C). These results suggest that precipitation extremes increase for both dry and wet regions, and faster trends are observed in dry regions. However, the same magnitude of warming causes more extreme precipitation in wet regions. Therefore, more extreme precipitation in future may raise the risk of flooding in both dry and wet regions, particularly for wet regions, due to the stronger relative intensity and faster increases against warming.","[Han, Jingya; Du, Haibo; Wu, Zhengfang; He, Hong S.] Northeast Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Proc & Ecol Secur Changbai Mt, Minist Educ, Sch Geog Sci, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Du, Haibo; He, Hong S.] Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resource, Columbia, MO 65211 USA",Northeast Normal University - China; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Du, HB (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Key Lab Geog Proc & Ecol Secur Changbai Mt, Minist Educ, Sch Geog Sci, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.;Du, HB (corresponding author), Univ Missouri, Sch Nat Resource, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",duhb655@nenu.edu.cn,"he, shan/JUV-4092-2023","Han, Jingya/0000-0001-9329-9504; Wu, Zhengfang/0000-0003-3406-7011; He, Hong S./0000-0002-3983-2512; Du, Haibo/0000-0001-6195-085X","National Key R&D Program of China [2016YFA0602301]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41601052]; Science and Technology Development Plan of Jilin Province [20190201291JC, 20180520098JH]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science and Technology Development Plan of Jilin Province,"The data for this paper are available at the National Meteorological Information Center of China (https://data.cma.cn).

J,"Lekakis, EJ",,,,"Lekakis, Eleftheria J.",,,Economic nationalism and the cultural politics of consumption under austerity: The rise of ethnocentric consumption in Greece,JOURNAL OF CONSUMER CULTURE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Austerity; political consumerism; ethnocentric consumption; economic nationalism; nationalism,CONSUMERISM; PATRIOTISM,"By nuancing the politics of consumption in the context of austerity, this article highlights the rise of economic nationalism and the reconfiguration of consumer cultures at the aftermath of the global financial crisis. As it argues, in the context of Greece, three types of consumer culture have manifested; these are evoking consumption as resilience, resistance or reinforcement. This work focuses on the latter through the phenomenon of ethnocentric consumption, which is part and parcel of economic nationalism. Economic nationalism can be explored through promotion of ethnocentric consumption and is demonstrable both in the inception and constitution of nation states, but also in times of crisis. This article critically appraises ethnocentric consumption as consumption based on ethnocentric criteria (natural resources, ownership, production, manufacturing, distribution and labour force). In the context of the crisis in Greece, economic nationalism has become manifest as a solution to the national economy. The specific case chosen is a citizens' movement and its campaign for the promotion of ethnocentric consumption. A close examination of the campaign (We Consume What We Produce) reveals the historical alignment of the state's and citizens' economic interests, the reverberation of state narrative from the 1980s and exclusionary nationalism which is also used by fascists. Campaigns for ethnocentric consumption limit the creativity of consumer politics. First, this phenomena appears to be an alternative vehicle for political parties. Second, it is tied around a normative narrative of economic recovery, which is particularly mythological. Third, its overall target is to maximise competitiveness on a global scale, and finally, it demonstrates a densely dangerous relationship with economic nationalism. Yet, it is important to situate this phenomenon within the context of consumer cultures under austerity, especially as more creative modalities of social economy initiatives by grassroots groups have been re-socialising the market.","[Lekakis, Eleftheria J.] Univ Sussex, Media & Commun, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Lekakis, EJ (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Sch Media Film & Mus, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",e.lekakis@sussex.ac.uk,"Lekakis, Eleftheria/I-2606-2019","Lekakis, Eleftheria J./0000-0002-2080-2997",,,,,47,30,31,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1469-5405,1741-2900,,J CONSUM CULT,J.

He explored the necessary conditions for viability in any complex system whether an organism, an organization or a country. Although the model was first applied in his work in the steel industry, many further applications were made during his later work as a consultant. The best known of these was when he was invited by President Salvadore Allende of Chile in 1970 to model the social economy of that country. That experiment was brutally cut short in 1973 by the CIA assisted coup during which Allende was killed and Pinochet's dictatorship installed. The model itself draws on mathematics, psychology, biology, neurophysiology, communication theory, anthropology and philosophy. It was first expressed in mathematical terms in 'The Cybernetic Factory'; next it was described in neurophysiological terms in Brain of the firm; and finally according to logic and graphic presentation in Heart of Enterprise and Diagnosing the System for Organizations. This last version is the one that is most accessible. It enables people to address organizational issues in a way that skirts the usual categories and organization charts and gets down to the actual necessary functions, no matter who is performing them. With this model people can get a boost as they diagnose or design an organizations. One aspect is to discover what the organization's critical variables are and to find or install the homeostats that will show that they are maintaining equilibrium. Within that context, the model will help you ascertain that the principle functions and communications channels are in place and can function effectively. A crucial aspect of the VSM is that it is recursive; that is that the same relationships can be traced from the shop floor to the corporation or from the village to the country. Two examples will be discussed: a small business and the Chilean work from the 1970s.

This article presents a case study of aspects of the local economy, principally viewed through land market activity and inter-personal litigation, in the early fourteenth century. It concludes that, in this context, there is little evidence for such non-aggressive activity during the subsistence crises of c.1300. Instead, a focus on the market and best economic opportunity persisted in ways that were likely to have been antithetical to contemporary views of charitable giving and which may have informed other aspects of social and economic dealing within the local community.","[Schofield, Phillipp R.] Univ Coll Wales Aberystwyth, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",Aberystwyth University,,,,"Schofield, Phillipp/0000-0003-0278-0509",,,,,67,30,35,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",0013-0117,,,ECON HIST REV,Econ.

Successful policy cases in Europe and Spain have been studied. Qualitative data have been collected through key policy documents, experts, and focus groups. As a main finding, the study shows that this new model of policies exhibits the following features: it focuses on transformative change, follows the public-community partnership governance approach and the mainstream approach in the sense of a broader policy context, and finally, it is innovative in terms of means and of complex systematization of strategies. Difficulties in the implementation of the partnership approach, in the deployment of the policy-mainstreaming approach, and in the acceptance of the SE framed by all policymakers, SE representatives, and government staff, and constraints in financial endowment are the main critical factors in the implementation of these policies.","[Chaves-Avila, Rafael] Univ Valencia, Appl Econ Dept, Avda Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Chaves-Avila, Rafael] Univ Valencia, IUDESCOOP, Avda Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Ramon Gallego-Bono, Juan] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Appl Econ Dept, Avda Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Chaves-Avila, R (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Appl Econ Dept, Avda Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain.;Chaves-Avila, R (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, IUDESCOOP, Avda Tarongers, Valencia 46022, Spain.",Rafael.Chaves@uv.es; Juan.R.Gallego@uv.es,"Bono, Juan Ramón Gallego/AAU-2260-2020; Chaves, Rafael/F-1967-2016","Bono, Juan Ramón Gallego/0000-0003-3147-296X; Chaves, Rafael/0000-0003-4087-1284",Regional Government of Valencia [S5429000]; EESC [CES/CSS/2017/03/24131],Regional Government of Valencia; EESC,The research reported was partially supported by Grants S5429000 from the Regional Government of Valencia and CES/CSS/2017/03/24131 from the EESC.,,81,29,30,0,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,12,10,,,,,,,4059,10.3390/su12104059,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12104059,,,29,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MC6VG,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000543421400117,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we emphasized the close connection between the number of haze days in early winter in the North China Plain and the September-October sea ice in the west of the Beaufort Sea (R = 51) via both observational analyses and numerical experiments. Due to efficient radiative cooling, the responses of atmospheric circulations partially manifested as reductions of surface wind speed over the Beaufort Sea and Gulf of Alaska, resulting in a warmer sea surface in the subsequent November. The sea surface temperature anomalies over the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska acted as a bridge. The warmer sea surface efficiently heated the above air and led to suitable atmospheric backgrounds to enhance the potential of haze weather (e.g., a weaker East Asian jet stream and a Rossby wave-like train propagated from North China and the Sea of Japan, through the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, to the Cordillera Mountains). Near the surface, the weakening sea level pressure gradient stimulated anomalous southerlies over the coastal area of China and brought about a calm and moist environment for haze formation. The thermal inversion was also enhanced to restrict the downward transportation of clear and dry upper air. Thus, the horizontal and vertical dispersion were both limited, and the fine particles were apt to accumulate and cause haze pollution.","[Yin, Zhicong; Li, Yuyan; Wang, Huijun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Minist Educ,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Eva, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yin, Zhicong; Wang, Huijun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS","Li, YY (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change ILCEC, Minist Educ,Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Eva, Nanjing 210044, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yyan370@163.com,"wang, hui/HSG-6135-2023; Wang, Hui/HMU-9512-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41705058, 91744311]; National Key Research and Development Plan [2016YFA0600703]; CAS-PKU Partnership program; Jiangsu Innovation and Entrepreneurship team",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Plan; CAS-PKU Partnership program; Jiangsu Innovation and Entrepreneurship team,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41705058 and 91744311), the National Key Research and Development Plan (2016YFA0600703), the CAS-PKU Partnership program, and the funding of the Jiangsu Innovation and Entrepreneurship team.",,45,28,28,1,26,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",1680-7316,1680-7324,,ATMOS CHEM PHYS,Atmos.

Such zone is characterized as hot and stuffy in summer, while cold and wet in winter. Due to such hostile climate conditions, many existing buildings in such zone suffer from poor thermal performance either in the envelope or indoor environment. With the advance of the social economy, there is an increasing demand for improving the indoor thermal environment. Hence an energy-efficient and low-cost retrofit of these buildings has become a priority in such zone. Due to the enormous types of buildings in this zone, it becomes highly important to identify standard buildings for each type, as to offer guidance for designing proper retrofit strategies correspondingly. To achieve that, this study develops a performance index system (PIS) based on architectural typology, demonstrated though examples of residential buildings. The PIS consists of construction year, plane form, floor area, building orientation, number of floors, building structure and the types of cold and heat sources. Three hundred and four residential buildings in an administrative region of Hangzhou were selected to collect relevant data of the index system. Through correlation and cluster analysis, the classification indexes of these residential buildings are calculated based on the influence of each performance index on the electricity energy consumption throughout the year, and six types of buildings are finally refined as representative standard types. The methodology of standard building selection through PIS proposed in this study is not restricted to residential buildings, and thus provides an efficient methodological support for the classification and retrofit of many types of existing buildings in the hot summer and cold winter zone in China.","[Gui, Xue-chen; Ma, Yi-teng; Chen, Shu-qin; Ge, Jian] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Chen, SQ (corresponding author), Zhejiang Univ, Coll Civil Engn & Architecture, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",hn_csq@126.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China Low carbon climate-responsive Heating and Cooling of Cities (LoHCool) [51561135002]; China National Key R&D Program Solutions to heating and cooling of buildings in the Yangtze river region [2016YFC0700301],National Natural Science Foundation of China Low carbon climate-responsive Heating and Cooling of Cities (LoHCool); China National Key R&D Program Solutions to heating and cooling of buildings in the Yangtze river region,The study has been supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China Low carbon climate-responsive Heating and Cooling of Cities (LoHCool) (Grant No. 51561135002) and by the China National Key R&D Program Solutions to heating and cooling of buildings in the Yangtze river region (Grant No. 2016YFC0700301).,,23,28,28,4,48,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2352-7102,,,J BUILD ENG,J.

At present, with the ongoing advancement of social economy and requirement of water, the water resources shortage problem has worsened, and the operation of reservoirs, in terms of consumption of flood water, has become significantly important. To achieve optimal reservoirs operating policies, a considerable amount of optimization and simulation models have been introduced in the course of recent years. Subsequently, the assessment and estimation that is associated with the operation of reservoir stays conventional. In the present study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models and a Genetic Algorithm model has been employed to two reservoirs in Ganga River basin, India in order to obtain the optimal reservoir operational policies. The objective function has been added to reduce the yearly sum of squared deviation from preferred storage capacity and required release for the irrigation purpose. The rule curves that were estimated via random search have been discovered to be consistent with that of demand requests. Thus, in the present case study, on the basis of the generated result, it has been concluded that GA-derived optimal reservoir operation rules are competitive and promising, and can be efficiently used for the derivation of operation of the reservoir.","[Anand, Jatin; Gosain, Ashvani Kumar; Khosa, Rakesh] Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Anand, J (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Civil Engn, New Delhi 110016, India.",cez138430@civil.iitd.ac.in; gosain@civil.iitd.ac.in; rakesh.khosa@gmail.com,"Anand, Jatin/AAY-1154-2021","ANAND, JATIN/0000-0001-7610-9174",Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (India),Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (India),The authors would like to thank Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (India) for providing support for conducting this study.

Compared with frequently-used satellite-borne sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multispectral sensors provide an opportunity to monitor soil salinization with on-demand high spatial and temporal resolution. This study aims to quantitatively estimate soil salt content (SSC) using UAV-borne multispectral imagery, and explore the deep mining of multispectral data. For this purpose, a total of 60 soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected from Shahaoqu Irrigation Area in Inner Mongolia, China. Meanwhile, from the UAV sensor we obtained the multispectral data, based on which 22 spectral covariates ( 6 spectral bands and 16 spectral indices) were constructed. The sensitive spectral covariates were selected by means of gray relational analysis (GRA), successive projections algorithm (SPA) and variable importance in projection (VIP), and from these selected covariates estimation models were built using back propagation neural network (BPNN) regression, support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) regression, respectively. The performance of the models was assessed by coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean squared error (RMSE) and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD). The results showed that the estimation accuracy of the models had been improved markedly using three variable selection methods, and VIP outperformed GRA and GRA outperformed SPA. However, the model accuracy with the three machine learning algorithms turned out to be significantly different: RF > SVR > BPNN. All the 12 SSC estimation models could be used to quantitatively estimate SSC (RPD > 1.4) while the VIP-RF model achieved the highest accuracy (R-c(2) = 0.835, R-p(2) = 0.812, RPD = 2.299). The result of this study proved that UAV-borne multispectral sensor is a feasible instrument for SSC estimation, and provided a reference for further similar research.","[Wei, Guangfei; Li, Yu; Zhang, Zhitao; Chen, Junying; Yao, Zhihua; Lao, Congcong; Chen, Huifang] Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Wei, Guangfei; Zhang, Zhitao; Chen, Junying; Yao, Zhihua; Lao, Congcong; Chen, Huifang] Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Minist Educ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yinwen] Northwest A&F Univ, Dept Foreign Languages, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China; Northwest A&F University - China,"Li, Y; Zhang, ZT (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Coll Water Resources & Architectural Engn, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Zhang, ZT (corresponding author), Northwest A&F Univ, Key Lab Agr Soil & Water Engn Arid & Semiarid Are, Minist Educ, Yangling, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",liyu2188@aliyun.com; zhangzhitao@nwafu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Chi/JSK-0744-2023; Zhang, Zhitao/AAD-7087-2019",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0403302, 2016YFD0200700]; Science and Technology Plan Project of YangLing [2018GY-03]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2452019180]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; Science and Technology Plan Project of YangLing; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"The research is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0403302, 2016YFD0200700).

Associated narrowly with neoliberal ideas, conventional notions of innovation-like its capitalocentric counterparts, enterprise and entrepreneurialism-may promise higher productivity, global competitiveness and technological progress but do not fundamentally change the 'rules of the game'. In contrast, an emerging field reimagines social innovation as disruptive change in social relations and institutional configurations. This article explores the conceptual and political differences within this pre-paradigmatic field, and argues for a more transformative understanding of social innovation. Building on the work of David Graeber, I mobilize the novel constructs of 'play' and 'games' to advance our understanding of the contradictory process of institutionalizing social innovation for urban transformation. This is illustrated through a case study of Liverpool, where diverse approaches to innovation are employed in attempts to resolve longstanding socio-economic problems. Dominant market- and state-led economic development policies-likened to a 'regeneration game'-are contrasted with more experimental, creative, democratic and potentially more effective forms of social innovation, seeking urban change through playing with the rules of the game. I conclude by considering how the play-game dialectic illuminates and reframes the way transformative social innovation might be cultivated by urban policy, the contradictions this entails, and possible ways forward.","[Thompson, Matthew] Univ Liverpool, Heseltine Inst Publ Policy Practice & Pl, 1-7 Abercromby Sq, Liverpool L69 7WY, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Thompson, M (corresponding author), Univ Liverpool, Heseltine Inst Publ Policy Practice & Pl, 1-7 Abercromby Sq, Liverpool L69 7WY, Merseyside, England.",matthew.thompson@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Thompson, Matthew/0000-0002-5691-4851",,,,,86,27,29,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0309-1317,1468-2427,,INT J URBAN REGIONAL,Int.

The frequency of haze events in February typically varies from the number of haze days in the winter. To improve the understanding of haze pollution in February, this study not only showed the large-scale atmospheric circulations associated with the variation in the haze, but also analyzed its connection with Arctic sea ice. The observational and large ensemble model results both illustrated that the preceding increase in the early-winter Chukchi Sea ice might intensify the February haze pollution. The accumulated sea ice over the Chukchi Sea resulted in a steeper meridional sea surface temperature gradient and a significant and persistent westerly thermal wind. In February, the responsive pattern in the atmosphere developed into a Rossby wave-like pattern, linking the Chukchi Sea ice and the February haze pollution. Modulating by the induced large-scale atmospheric circulations, the horizontal and vertical atmospheric ventilation conditions and the hygroscopic growth conditions enhanced the frequency of haze pollution events.","[Yin, Zhicong; Wang, Huijun] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yin, Zhicong; Wang, Huijun] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Xiaohui] Environm Meteorol Forecast Ctr Beijing Tianjin He, China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China","Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Atmospheric Physics, CAS; China Meteorological Administration","Yin, ZC (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Joint Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster,Minist Educ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Yin, ZC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Atmospher Phys, Nansen Zhu Int Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yinzhc@163.com,"Wang, Hui/HMU-9512-2023; wu, jun/ISB-8607-2023; MA, XIAO/HHN-5611-2022; wang, hui/HSG-6135-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41705058, 41421004, 91744311]; National Key Research and Development Plan [2016YFA0600703]; Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province [17KJB170014]; Jiangsu Innovation and Entrepreneurship team",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Plan; Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province; Jiangsu Innovation and Entrepreneurship team,"This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41705058, 41421004, and 91744311), the National Key Research and Development Plan (2016YFA0600703), Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province (17KJB170014), and the funding of the Jiangsu Innovation and Entrepreneurship team.",,29,27,29,6,32,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,BOSTON,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",0894-8755,1520-0442,,J CLIMATE,J.

This study focused on the estimation of the soil salt content in saline-alkali soils and applied the Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA) method to the estimation model; twelve spectral forms were applied in the estimation model of the spectra and soil salt content. Regression modeling was performed using the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) method. Proximal-field spectral measurements data and soil samples were collected in the Yellow River Irrigation regions of Shizuishan City. A total of 60 samples were collected. The results showed that application of the SPA method improved the modeled determination coefficient (R-2) and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and reduced the modeled root mean square error (RMSE) and the percentage root mean square error (RMSE%); the maximum value of R-2 increased by 0.22, the maximum value of RPD increased by 0.97, the maximum value of the RMSE decreased by 0.098 and the maximum value of the RMSE% decreased by 8.52%.

(2) LUCC is affected by climate change and human activities, with greater climate change impacts in the northwest than the southeast and greater among which human-induced impacts on the hilly/gully region in the central part. (3) LUCC will produce long-term ecological and environmental processes, such as surface runoff, soil erosion, soil moisture and carbon cycling.

Groundwater plays an extremely significant role in the development of the regional social economy. In this study, 50 sets of water samples, collected from 25 wells during October 2016 and June 2017, were utilized to determine the hydrogeochemistry and the suitability of groundwater in the alluvial-diluvial plain of southwest Shandong Province for different applications, such as drinking and irrigation. Most of the water samples could be classified as hard-fresh water or hard-brackish water, and the dominant water types were HCO3-Na and mixed types. Water-rock interactions and evaporation were the dominant controlling factors in the formation of the hydrochemical components in the groundwater. Dissolutions of silicate, calcite, dolomite, and gypsum are the major reactions contributing and defining the groundwater chemistry in this plain. Moreover, cation exchange is a non-negligible hydrogeochemical process in this plain. Calculated saturation index (SI) values indicate that aragonite, calcite and dolomite are saturated, while the SI values for gypsum and halite are unsaturated. Based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the groundwater quality ranges from excellent to very poor. More than 50% of all groundwater samples from 2016 are categorized as poor or very poor, suggesting that the water from these wells is not suitable for drinking.

It is therefore urgently required to frame policies that can be adopted to realize the sustainable development of a social economy under the constraint of atmospheric environment in China's resource-based cities. In this paper, we develop a dynamic optimization model by using input-output analysis with gross regional product (GRP) maximization as the objective function. This model contains three submodels: the socioeconomic submodel, atmo-environmental control submodel, and energy submodel. The model is applied to Tangshan City, a typical resource-based industrial city, to conduct a dynamic simulation with 13 terms from 2013 to 2025 and based on the data in 2012. The goal for the model operation is to realize the optimal development of a social economy under the restrain of certain emission levels of air pollutants. This goal is achieved by introducing a comprehensive policy that includes a residential clean energy promotion policy and an industry emission reduction policy, and industrial restructuring also plays a role by industrial subsidies. The simulation results demonstrate that sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) can be reduced by 53% and 45%, respectively, in Tangshan City in 2025 compared with their values in 2012 with an annual GRP growth rate of 6.2%. The total output of the clean energy in the simulation period is 41.4 million tons of standard coal. The goal of improving the atmospheric environment and sustainable development of social economies in resource-based cities can be achieved by coordinating the relationship among economic development, atmospheric environmental protection, and energy consumption through a dynamic optimization model with a comprehensive policy and industrial restructuring.

These organizations do not solely focus on a member's advantage but act on behalf of some collective identity. To enhance our understanding of the nature of co-operative governance on the neighborhood level, we draw on theoretical concepts that are context-sensitive, helping us to catch the institutional conditions in a specific place which are enabling individuals and groups to act and organize collectively. Thus, we enrich the abstract concept of governance put forward by New Institutional Economics. Based on a systematic analysis of case studies, the paper shows that the governance of community co-operatives is based on place-bound values. However, the encounter of divergent imaginations of the neighborhood results in different co-operative practices: e.g., either a government-directed practice to discipline the community or a community-initiated practice of self-organization.","[Lang, Richard; Roessl, Dietmar] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, RiCC Res Inst Cooperat & Cooperat, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Lang, R (corresponding author), Vienna Univ Econ & Business, RiCC Res Inst Cooperat & Cooperat, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",richard.lang@wu.ac.at; dietmar.roessl@wu.ac.at,"Lang, Richard/AAI-6420-2020","Lang, Richard/0000-0001-9505-1289",,,,,67,26,26,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0957-8765,1573-7888,,VOLUNTAS,Voluntas,DEC,2011,22,4,,,,,706,730,,10.1007/s11266-011-9210-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11266-011-9210-8,,,25,Social Issues,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Issues,840XQ,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000296475800009,View Full Record in Web of Science

China is a country with a large population and diverse terrain, and it is necessary to project future extreme heat changes in the sub-regions. This study used a specially designed dataset, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulations, namely CESM low-warming, to investigate the EHEs in China under 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C global warming. The results indicate that the regional mean warming over China will exceed the global average, about 1.63 degrees C and 2.24 degrees C in 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C warmer futures. Compared to the present-day (1976-2005), the frequency and duration of the EHEs in South China are projected to increase the most among the sub-regions. For example, the frequency of EHEs in South China at 1.5 degrees C and 2.0 degrees C warming will exceed 3 and 3.5 times the present-day level. However, when global warming rises from 1.5 degrees C to 2.0 degrees C, the increased impacts relative to the 1.5 degrees C warming level will be the lowest in South China (less than 40%), and the highest increased impacts are projected to appear in Northeast China (53%-84%) and Northwest China (53%-107%). The main reason for this situation is that compared with the 1.5 degrees C scenario, the upper zonal westerly in northern China weakens and the continental high pressure enhances under the 2.0 degrees C scenario. Therefore, limiting global warming at 1.5 degrees C instead of 2.0 degrees C is beneficial for eliminating extreme heat events, especially for Northeast China and Northwest China.","[Zhang Gu-Wei; Zeng Gang; Iyakaremye, Vedaste] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China; [You Qing-Long] Fudan Univ, Inst Atmospher Sci, Dept Atmospher & Ocean Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology; Fudan University,"Zeng, G (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Minist Educ KLME, Nanjing 210044, Peoples R China.",zenggang@nuist.edu.cn,"Iyakaremye, Vedaste/AGK-7642-2022; Zeng, Gang/IWM-2172-2023; Zhang, Guwei/CAI-0239-2022","Zeng, Gang/0000-0003-3331-2337; Zhang, Guwei/0000-0001-8272-3007","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFA0603804]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41430528, 41831174]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFA0603804), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41430528 and 41831174).",,63,25,28,7,46,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING, 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1674-9278,,,ADV CLIM CHANG RES,Adv.

Dual role pressures from the work family domains may reduce individual's engagement in work settings, consequently, exploring the coping strategy becomes imperative. The current study investigated the role of job crafting and gender on the work-family conflict based on a field survey of employees from China. The results showed that there was no significant difference between men and women in work-family conflict (both work interfering with family and family interfering with work). Neither men nor women would lower their work engagement when work interfered with family issues. However, when families interfered with work, women were becoming less likely to engage in work than men. Furthermore, job crafting was verified as an antecedent which reduced the influence of work on family in the male group. For female employees, job crafting helped to reduce the influence of family on their work. The current study would help to understand the impact of gender on work-family interface, and provide valuable implications for the organizational strategies and social support systems to deal with work-family conflict.","[Lyu, Xiaojun; Fan, Yangyang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Lyu, Xiaojun; Fan, Yangyang] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Huashan Rd 1954, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Lyu, XJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.;Lyu, XJ (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Huashan Rd 1954, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",Xjlv@sjtu.edu.cn,"范, 洋洋/GQP-4358-2022","范, 洋洋/0000-0003-2505-1915",Chinese National Social Science Fund [15BGL097]; Shanghai Jiao Tong University SMC-Excellent Scholar Award (2018),Chinese National Social Science Fund; Shanghai Jiao Tong University SMC-Excellent Scholar Award (2018),"This research was supported by Chinese National Social Science Fund (Grant No.15BGL097), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University SMC-Excellent Scholar Award (2018).",,49,25,28,16,99,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1046-1310,1936-4733,,CURR PSYCHOL,Curr.

As important actors in regional strategy and policy, county-level regions have played an increasingly significant role in the development of China's social economy. However, the existing research on the RCUED lacks the fine depiction of the county-level administrative units. Using 2000 and 2010 census data and the statistical analysis method, we uncovered the evolution characteristics of China's urbanization and economic development and conducted a quantitative identification for the RCUED with improved methods using the quadrant map approach. In addition, we investigated the spatial correlation effect of the RCUED using the spatial autocorrelation analysis method. The results were as follows: 1) In general, a high degree of matching exists between China's urbanization and economic development at the county level at the significance level of 0.01. The correlation coefficients between China's urbanization and economic development in 2000 and 2010 were 0.608 and 0.603, respectively. 2) A significant regional difference exists in the RCUED at the county level. Based on a comparative analysis of 2276 county units in China in the two years, we found that county units can be categorized as under-urbanized, basic coordination and over-urbanized in various areas. No situation was observed where urbanization seriously lagged behind the economic development level, so the levels of urbanization and economic development appear to be basically coordinated, and the coordination state may be gradually optimized over time. 3) Over time, the spatial dependency of the RCUED has weakened and the spatial heterogeneity has increased. Northeast China has always been an area characterized by over-urbanization. The number of county units classified as under-urbanized has begun to decline in eastern coastal urban agglomeration areas, while counties rich in resources have transformed from having point-shaped over-urbanization to plane-shaped under-urbanization along the northern border, and the number of over-urbanized county units has increased in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. 4) 'Lag-lag' type and 'advance-advance' type accounted for 68% of all counties in China, and these counties were shown to have obvious spatial differentiation characteristics.","[Yang Zhen; Zhang Xiaolei; Lei Jun; Duan Zuliang; Li Jiangang] Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Yang Zhen; Li Jiangang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Lei, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",leijun@ms.xjb.ac.cn,"Zhang, Xiaolei/AAQ-5284-2021; Li, jiangang/GSJ-3954-2022","Zhang, Xiaolei/0000-0003-2369-2719; Li, jiangang/0000-0003-1406-4825","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road (Pan-TPE) [XDA20040400]","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road (Pan-TPE)","Under the auspices of the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Pan-Third Pole Environment Study for a Green Silk Road (Pan-TPE) (No. XDA20040400)",,41,25,27,15,85,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1002-0063,1993-064X,,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

The article encompasses the economic and social context in which the housing initiative emerged, the organisational features that define the cooperative, and its origins in the process of urban renewal of the former industrial site of Can Barna. The article also analyses its current development and its potential for scalability. Drawing on Moulaert's definition of social innovation, the authors argue that La Borda goes beyond the mere provision of housing to include public participation as a key component of the model. The Andel Model for cooperative housing is presented as the main source of inspiration for La Borda's model, including its roots in the social and cooperative economy and the role of the cession of use housing tenure. The article concludes there are reasons to believe La Borda will succeed in providing long-term affordable housing while engaging its residents in its daily management. The authors consider the suitability of La Borda's model elsewhere to be dependent on the economic, social and political context in which it is implemented.","[Cabre, Eduard] NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Andres, Arnau] LaCol Sccl, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain",New York University,"Cabré, E (corresponding author), NYU, Robert F Wagner Grad Sch Publ Serv, New York, NY 10003 USA.",Ecr325@nyu.edu,,,,,,,33,25,26,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1949-1247,1949-1255,,INT J HOUS POLICY,Int.

The developed method incorporated interval-parameter programming (IPP), stochastic robust optimization (SRO), two-stage stochastic programming (TSP), and mixed integer programming (MIP) within a general optimization framework to reflect uncertainties expressed as interval values and probability distributions in the regional electric power system. Three scenarios corresponding to different subsidy price levels and three cases associated with different pollutants emission reduction levels were designed. The electricity generation schemes, facility-expansion, pollutant emission, and system cost considering the subsidy policy and air pollution mitigation control had been obtained. The results indicated that subsidy policy would exert an important influence on the development of Tangshan's electric power system, which can reduce the cost advantage of conventional power generation and enhance the development enthusiasm of renewable power generation to power enterprises. In detail, the electricity generation amount of renewable energy would increase with the improvement of subsidy price level. Moreover, decision makers could identify the possible policy implementations and enforcements under considering the trade-off among system economy, security and environmental objectives. The modeling results were valuable for promoting new energy accommodation and supporting the sustainable development of social economy. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Zhen, J. L.; Huang, G.

Therefore, lightning-caused forest fire risk rating assessment is very important for forest management agency, because the risk rating assessment results could provide important information to prevent fires and allocate extinguishing resources. The existing forest fire risk rating assessment methods are more difficult for the area with sparse meteorological stations, imperfect lightning monitoring systems and complex terrain conditions. Based on remote sensing data and case-based reasoning principle, this paper proposed a method to overcome the limitations of existing forest fire risk rating assessment methods. The proposed method uses three dynamic and two static indexes to characterize the potential fire environment. The dynamic indexes are temperature condition index, vegetation condition index and water condition index. The static indexes are terrain fluctuation and LIS/OTD lightning density. In DaXingAn Mountains of China, the fire risk rating spatial distribution maps with 8-day cycle before the occurrences of historical lightning-caused fires were produced by using the lightning-caused forest fire risk rating assessment method during 2000-2006 in this paper. The results showed that most of the historical lightning-caused fires occurred in the region with high fire risk rating, and the spatial-temporal distribution changes of the lightning-caused fire risk rating followed the same trend as the changes in the number of lightning-caused fires. Therefore, the lightning-caused forest fire risk rating assessment method proposed in this paper could assess the fire risk rating effectively, and this method could also provide a reference for other countries and regions with sparse meteorological stations and imperfect lightning monitoring systems.","[Liu, Wenliang; Wang, Shixin; Zhou, Yi; Wang, Litao; Zhu, Jinfeng; Wang, Futao] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; The Institute of Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, CAS","Zhou, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Remote Sensing & Digital Earth, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",zhouyi@radi.ac.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41201441],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41201441).,,26,25,27,6,61,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0921-030X,1573-0840,,NAT HAZARDS,Nat.

Drawing on evidence from two villages in southern India, which are both close to, and deeply affected by, a major textile industry cluster, the article examines local labour markets, arguing that labour market segmentation is not simply caste-based. While some Dalits from one village have gained access to jobs in export markets, the same group of Dalits from another village have not. Furthermore, different groups of Dalits have had very different experiences of accessing jobs in urban areas, and the article shows that barriers to entry are located more in the rural social economy than in the urban industry. It is argued that villages only a few miles apart have very different local labour markets because they are uniquely and variously embedded in local institutions that interact with economic transformations in contingent ways. The article shows that having an industry on your doorstep means very different things for different people.","Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9RJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Carswell, G (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Dept Geog, Brighton BN1 9RJ, E Sussex, England.",g.carswell@sussex.ac.uk,,"Carswell, Grace/0000-0002-8570-1337",ESRC [ES/F026633/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F026633/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,69,25,27,1,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-2754,1475-5661,,T I BRIT GEOGR,Trans.

Research on forest land changes at the county level about its characteristics, rules, and spatial patterns is, therefore, important for regional resource protection and the sustainable development of the social economy. In this study we selected the GIS and Geoda software package to explore the spatial disparities of forest land changes at the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area county level, based on the global and local spatial autocorrelation analyses of exploratory spatial data. The results show that: 1) during 1985-2000, the global spatial autocorrelation of forest land change is significant in the study area. The global Moran's I value is 0.3122 for the entire time period and indicates significant positive spatial correlation (p < 0.05). Moran's I value of forest land change decreases from 0.3084 at the time stage I to 0.3024 at the time stage II; 2) the spatial clustering characteristics of forest land changes appear on the whole in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area. Moran's I value decreases from the time stage I to time stage II, which means that trend of spatial clustering of forest land change is weakened in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area; 3) the grid map of the local Moran's I for each county reflects local spatial homogeneity of forest land change, which means that spatial clustering about regions of high value and low value is especially significant. The regions with High-High correlation are mainly located in the north hilly area. However, the regions with Low-Low correlation were distributed in the middle of the study area. Therefore, protection strategies and concrete measures should be put in place for each regional cluster in the study area.","[Xie, Hualin; Kung, Chih-Chun] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yuluan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Xie, HL (corresponding author), Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Poyang Lake Ecoecon, Nanchang 330013, Peoples R China.",landuse2008@126.com,,"Xie, Hualin/0000-0002-4951-4526","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41061049, 41161087]; Planning Project of National Science and Technology [2006BAB15B02]; Technology Foundation of Jiangxi Education Department [GJJ12269]; Ministry of Environment Protection of China [STSN-09-00]; Young Scientist Plan Fund of Jiangxi Province",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Planning Project of National Science and Technology; Technology Foundation of Jiangxi Education Department; Ministry of Environment Protection of China; Young Scientist Plan Fund of Jiangxi Province,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41061049 and 41161087), Planning Project of National Science and Technology (No. 2006BAB15B02), Technology Foundation of Jiangxi Education Department (No. GJJ12269), Young Scientist Plan Fund of Jiangxi Province and Planning Project of Ministry of Environment Protection of China (No. STSN-09-00).",,20,25,29,2,79,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",2095-0195,2095-0209,,FRONT EARTH SCI-PRC,Front.

Data on marine reclamation were extracted from 49 Landsat remote sensing images from 7 different periods from 1985 to 2015, and ichthyoplankton data from 1982 to 2014 were compiled. The trend of fragmentation showed that the number of artificial heterogeneous patches significantly increased, and the isolation of habitat landscape became more intense. As a result, the spatial patterns of ichthyoplankton habitat rapidly transformed from a continuous and integral distribution to a divided and fragmented distribution, which drastically changed numerous environmental factors and deeply reshaped normal fish recruitment activities by impacting the number and abundance of ELHSF.","[Ding, Xiaosong; Li, Miao; Li, Jiajia] Shanghai Ocean Univ, Coll Marine Sci, Shanghai 201306, Peoples R China; [Ding, Xiaosong; Shan, Xiujuan; Chen, Yunlong; Li, Miao; Jin, Xianshi] Minist Agr & Rural Affairs, Key Lab Sustainable Dev Marine Fisheries, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Ding, Xiaosong; Shan, Xiujuan; Chen, Yunlong; Li, Miao; Jin, Xianshi] Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, Shandong Prov Key Lab Fishery Resources & Ecoenvi, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Ding, Xiaosong; Shan, Xiujuan; Chen, Yunlong; Li, Miao; Jin, Xianshi] Chinese Acad Fishery Sci, Yellow Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Qingdao 266071, Peoples R China; [Shan, Xiujuan; Jin, Xianshi] Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food Prod Proc, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China","Shanghai Ocean University; Ministry of Agriculture & Rural Affairs; Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences; Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences; Yellow Sea Fisheries Research Institute, CAFS; Laoshan Laboratory","Shan, XJ (corresponding author), Pilot Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol Qingdao, Lab Marine Fisheries Sci & Food Prod Proc, Qingdao 266237, Peoples R China.",shanxj@ysfri.ac.cn,"li, jia/GVT-7587-2022; LI, QI/IUM-8577-2023; li, jy/HTT-1535-2023; Li, Jiaxi/HTS-3430-2023","Li, Jiaxi/0000-0002-8197-8590",National Research Program of China [2017YFE0104400]; National Basic Research Program of China [2015CB453303]; Taishan Scholar Project Special Fund; Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao) [2017ASTCP-ES07]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41506168],National Research Program of China; National Basic Research Program of China(National Basic Research Program of China); Taishan Scholar Project Special Fund; Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Funding for this work was provided by the National Research Program of China, No. 2017YFE0104400, the National Basic Research Program of China under contract (No. 2015CB453303), the Taishan Scholar Project Special Fund, the Aoshan Talent Project Financially Supported by Pilot National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao) (No. 2017ASTCP-ES07), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41506168).

The study chooses 334 listed companies in Chinese high water-risk industries and selects 2010 to 2015 as the water disclosure observation period. The results show that water disclosure is negatively related to corporate risk-taking, and the relationship between the two varies with the difference in property rights and the relative level of water information disclosure. A further study finds that, organizational legitimacy plays a significant moderating role on the impact of water disclosure on corporate risk-taking.

More precisely, the development of very abstract contracts ballooning subprime mortgage market would be at the origin of the last crisis. Financial creativity can produce severe consequences but it can also drive socio-economic changes favourable to the society. This article presents social impact bonds as a telling example of a financial innovation that could contribute to a significant improvement of society. These assets are used to fund social programs such as helping homeless people, rehabilitating prisoners or supporting early interventions with underprivileged people. By redesigning social programs through market-based solutions, SIB s enhanced transparency of expenditures made by government, they can help to stabilize economic activity and they can contribute to the self-realization of disadvantaged people. This reflexive paper reconsiders finance through the lens of the financial and ethical implications of these new assets. By combining usual aspects of finance with social welfare, social impact bonds imply new practices but also a new way of thinking the concept of return. This article aims at discussing these aspects.

However, oil and coal reserves are decreasing due to an increase in energy demand for the development of social economy. Additionally, fine coal is usually beneficiated by flotation using diesel or kerosene as collectors, which may be a waste of energy. Therefore, using biodiesel as a collector for coal flotation has its potential value. In this investigation, biodiesel was used as a collector for coal flotation. Three bituminous coal samples with different coal ranks were selected, that is, gas coal, coking coal, and lean coal. FTIR results showed that biodiesel contained much more abundant unsaturated fatty acids than diesel. Flotation results showed that the flotation performances of three coal samples using biodiesel as collector were similar to that using diesel as collector. Even better, the concentrate yields of three coal samples using biodiesel as collector were a little higher than that using diesel as collector, while their concentrate ash contents were similar. Throughout this paper, it was proved that biodiesel could have a potential application in coal flotation.","[Xia, Wencheng] China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Key Lab Coal Proc & Efficient Utilizat, Minist Educ, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",China University of Mining & Technology,"Xia, WC (corresponding author), China Univ Min & Technol, Sch Chem Engn & Technol, Key Lab Coal Proc & Efficient Utilizat, Minist Educ, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xiawencheng@cumt.edu.cn,"Xia, Wencheng/J-1863-2012","Xia, Wencheng/0000-0002-9772-7251",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2015XKQY07]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2015XKQY07) and a Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.,,13,24,24,2,65,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1556-7036,1556-7230,,ENERG SOURCE PART A,Energy Sources Part A-Recovery Util.

Second, in Scenarios 1-4, the FES index value reached 0.545, 0.516, 0.585 and 0.637 respectively in 2020, which was enhanced in varying degrees when compared with Scenario 0. The simulation shows the implementation of forest management policies, socioeconomic development and environmental management combine to affect the FES in Beijing. The FES could develop into a good state when the productivity of forest resources, the stability of forest environments and the orderly development of the social economy are carefully maintained (in Scenario 4).

An innovation is therefore social to the extent that, either conveyed by the market or the non-profit sector, it is socially accepted and widely diffused throughout the society or in certain societal sub-domains, transformed depending on circumstances and ultimately institutionalized as new social practices or routines emerge. The field of social innovation turns critical societal problems into opportunities by actively involving the community actors. In the last years, we have identified that in the international academic debate a discussion is evolving around a number of interconnected concepts which intrinsically include two apparently contradictory dimensions: social and economic. Among them, one of the most visible is the social entrepreneurship concept. Social economy organizations, representing the outputs of the social entrepreneurship process, are extensively innovating; both in terms of the organizational forms they developed and in the manner they perform managerial activities. They are solving in new and innovative ways the tasks of planning, organizing, leading, motivating and controlling resources and people in order to achieve effectively and efficiently their purpose and objectives, fundamentally connected to social needs. Our paper contributes to clarifying the relation between the two concepts of innovation and social innovation by exploring the socializing trend that is conditioning relevant economic concepts. Meantime, by revealing the historic background and generic definition of the social entrepreneurship concept, we are advocating for the social innovation dimension of the social entrepreneurship concept.

Population-level data are increasingly used to develop risk profiles, or estimates, that clinicians and the consumer public may use to guide individual decisions about cancer screening. Individual risk perception forms a piece of a larger social economy of decision-making and choice that makes population screening possible. Individual decision-making depends on accessing and interpreting available clinical information, filtered through the lens of personal values and both cognitive and affective behavioural processes. That process is also mediated by changing social roles and interpersonal relationships. This paper begins to elucidate the influence of this 'social context' within the complexity of cancer screening. Reflecting on current work in risk and health, I consider how ethnographic narrative methods can enrich this model.","[Lee, Simon J.

In this paper, we comprehensively describe the process of the adjustment of administrative divisions at provincial and municipal levels in China and summarize the effects on the basic structure and patterns of the spatial development. We quantitatively assess the effects on fields such as urbanization and social economy through the use of multidimensional scaling. The results show that: 1) Upgrading county to municipality (or city-governed district) is the main way of adjusting the administrative divisions. It is also an important factor in the spatial differentiation of interprovincial urbanization. China's population urbanization can be divided into four patterns including interprovincial migration, provincial migration, natural growth, and growth caused by the adjustment of administrative divisions, which is also the main reason for the increased Chinese urbanization rate at the provincial level. 2) Taking the city of Beijing as an example, we generalize five adjustment patterns made to administrative divisions: the set-up of sub-districts, the set-up of regional offices, the upgrading of townships to sub-districts, the upgrading of townships to towns, and the set-up of towns and the addition of new regional offices. We summarize the municipal urban spatial structure, including the sub-district office area in the central urban area, the regional office area in the new urban area, the mixed area of villages, towns, and sub-district offices in the suburb area, and the township area in the outer suburb area. 3) The adjustment of administrative divisions triggers a significant circulative accumulation effect, resulting in the spatial locking of population and industrial agglomeration. It affects the evolution of the urban spatial form and plays an important role in shaping the urban spatial structure to move to the characteristic of multicenter. In general, the adjustment of administrative divisions was an important factor affecting the inflated statistical level of urbanization and also an important driving force for the evolution of Chinese urban spatial organization structure.","[Yu Hu; Deng Yu; Xu Shan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Yu Hu; Deng Yu] Chinese Acad Sci, Key Lab Reg Sustainable Dev Modeling, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Xu, S (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",xushan@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Yang, Shuang/GVT-5360-2022",,,,,,52,23,24,14,87,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1002-0063,1993-064X,,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

Second, to provide general theoretical insights into the ways in which the social economy relates to the contemporary debate on alternative development paradigms.","Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, I-00145 Rome, Italy",Roma Tre University,"Scarlato, M (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tre, Dipartimento Econ, Via Silvio DAmico 77, I-00145 Rome, Italy.",mscarlato@uniroma3.it,,"Scarlato, Margherita/0000-0002-7080-3664",,,,,81,23,28,2,78,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Emergy analysis is an effective method for value analysis of ecosystems, assessment of the health of ecosystems, which is based on principles of systems ecology and energy. And fuzzy logic is a generalization tools to operate with vaguely defined parameters or concepts, which has been extensively applied in the quality evaluation of soil and land. The health of agricultural land as an aggregate that takes into account the quality and productivity of land as well as the soil environment. This paper presents an integrated evaluation model based on emergy analysis and fuzzy logic and using the geographic information system (GIS) to evaluate the health of agricultural land. An evaluation system is developed, which includes quality, productivity and the soil environment. A major grain-producing region in the North China Plain. namely Luancheng County, was selected for the case study. Field survey, household inquiry, sampling, and experimental analysis were conducted in the study area. The health of agricultural land expressed as the emergy index ranged from 0.471 to 0.763; as the fuzzy index, from 0.603 to 0.878: and as a composite index, from 0.284 to 0.666. Based on the composite index, the agricultural land was divided into four classes, namely in perfect health (which accounted for 7.6% of the agricultural land), in normal health (54.3%). in sub-health (32.9%), and in poor health (5.2%). Overall, agricultural land in Luancheng County is healthy, although 89.00 km(2) of the farmland - mainly in Douyu. Nangao, and Liulintun - is in sub-health and 14.22 km(2) in Douyu is in poor health because of poor productivity and unfavorable soil environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A large number of these countries are incurring consequential costs that impact their national economies. It is crucial, therefore, to analyze the impact of such hazards on their economic development and provide a solid basis for future development strategies. The purpose of this paper is to assess the relationship between the economic development and the losses from coastal disasters, and to identify both the impact of hazards on the development, as well as the function of such development on the resilience to hazards. The data envelopment analysis (DEA) method is employed to build the assessment models. Data from 1995 to 2005 from eight Southeast countries are analyzed using the DEA models. A set of resilience index of these countries are concluded from the results. It is found that the economic development does not contribute to the strengthening of national resilience to coastal hazards. Inappropriate development could even impair the resilience. Additionally, the resilience to coastal hazards is impacted by various factors such as the allocation of resources and external assistance. From the analysis, a clear image is gained of the interaction between economic development and coastal hazards, which provides a basis for future development strategies.","[Zou, Le-Le; Wei, Yi-Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institutes of Science & Development, CAS","Wei, YM (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, POB 8712, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",ymwei@deas.harvard.edu,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [70425001, 70733005]; National Key Projects from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2006-BAB08B01]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Projects from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China(National Basic Research Program of China),"Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under the grant Nos. 70425001 and 70733005, and the National Key Projects from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (grants 2006-BAB08B01), is gratefully acknowledged.

It offers new empirical evidence from Spain, based on Stakeholder Theory, about the differences between cooperatives (Coops) and Capitalist Firms (CFs) in relation to the distribution of economic value between the different stakeholders. For this purpose, panel data was analysed using the Correlated Random Effects approach. The results reveal that cooperative firms generate value for some of the stakeholders analysed, specifically for their partners and creditors, but no significant differences have been found with CFs in terms of workers and the state. In both cases, it can be inferred that the period analysed has influenced the results, since it has been found that, first, cooperatives adjust wages downward rather than dismiss workers during a recession, which is in line with previous research, and second, that their tax contribution to the state is lower because they are subject to a more favourable tax system in Spain.","[Fernandez-Guadano, Josefina; Lopez-Millan, Manuel; Sarria-Pedroza, Jesus] Univ Complutense Madrid, Accounting & Finance Dept, Madrid 28040, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Fernandez-Guadaño, J (corresponding author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Accounting & Finance Dept, Madrid 28040, Spain.",jofernan@ucm.es; mlopezmillan@ccee.ucm.es; jsarria@ucm.es,"FERNÁNDEZ-GUADAÑO, Josefina/A-8847-2013","FERNÁNDEZ-GUADAÑO, Josefina/0000-0001-8704-1486; SARRIA-PEDROZA, Jesus Hernando/0000-0002-2678-5091; LOPEZ-MILLAN, MANUEL/0000-0001-8461-4699",,,,,43,22,25,2,30,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUL,2020,12,13,,,,,,,5462,10.3390/su12135462,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12135462,,,11,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MM6IN,,"Green Published, Green Accepted, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000550258100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In light of this, this article explores the potential of SE international expansion as a catalyst for scaling social impact across borders. From our reading of the literature, we discern three major typologies of cross-border scaling: Control-based, altruism-based, and hybrid. Drawing on a multiple-case study of nine international SEs, we examine why and how SEs deploy these scaling strategies on an international scale; the challenges to maximize social impact across borders associated with each of the scaling strategies, and the resources and actions that SEs can mobilize to manage such challenges associated with international expansion. Contrary to conventional wisdom and mainstream theory depicting SEs as small-sized organizations that suffer from different limitations to expand beyond their traditional national boundaries, our findings illustrate how these organizations can successfully operate on an international scale and simultaneously generate financial, social, and environmental value.","[Bretos, Ignacio; Diaz-Foncea, Millan; Marcuello, Carmen] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Business Org & Management, Paseo de la Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Bretos, I (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Business Org & Management, Paseo de la Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",ibretos@unizar.es; millan@unizar.es; cmarcue@unizar.es,"Marcuello, Carmen/GMX-4468-2022; Bretos, Ignacio/AAQ-5137-2021; , Carmen/HTR-2718-2023; Bretos, Ignacio/HTN-4797-2023; Diaz-Foncea, Millan/IAP-4516-2023","Marcuello, Carmen/0000-0003-1745-8037; Bretos, Ignacio/0000-0002-4941-2028; Diaz Foncea, Millan/0000-0002-7584-4473",Regional Government of Aragon; European Regional Development Fund [Construyendo Europa desde Aragon] [GESES S28_17R],Regional Government of Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Regional Development Fund [Construyendo Europa desde Aragon],"This research was funded by the Regional Government of Aragon and the European Regional Development Fund [Construyendo Europa desde Aragon], grant number GESES S28_17R.",,72,22,23,2,25,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,8,,,,,,,3262,10.3390/su12083262,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12083262,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LR3MY,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000535598700195,View Full Record in Web of Science

Determining the ecological water consumption (EWC) of natural oases is a critical task for achieving sustainable ecosystem restoration and services in endorheic basins. In this study, the evapotranspiration of natural vegetation, evaporation of water area, and seepage in lakes and rivers were considered in the EWC. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model was combined with Landsat-8 images and eddy covariance flux measurements to calculate the daily EWC of natural oases in the lower Heihe River Basin (northwest China) during 2014 and 2015. The spatio-temporal variations of EWC were investigated in detail. The SEBS model could satisfactorily simulate the evapotranspiration (ET) of forest, shrub, mixed forest and water body with R-2 value greater than 0.84 and RMSE value less than 0.9 mm/day. The total EWC in 2014 and 2015 was 6.59 x 10(8 )m(3) and 7.65 x 10(8) m(3) , respectively, and the EWC of the Ejina Oasis accounted for approximately 50% of total value in the study area. The cumulative EWC increased gradually with the distance away from the riverbank as an exponential function and reached the plateau at certain distance. The monthly variation of EWC followed a unimodal curve with the peak in June and July, accounting for 42.16% and 36.28% of annual EWC in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The water balance analysis indicated that the river flow was not sufficient to provide the EWC of natural oases and water requirements of agriculture and social economy, and additional 1.23 x 10(8 )m(3) and 2.09 x 10(8) m(3) of groundwater needed to be exploited in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Several strategies for sustainable water resources allocation and ecosystem management in the study area were provided. Overall, this study provides an integrated approach with combinations of multiple techniques and high-resolution data for EWC calculation, which is useful for water footprint analysis and water resources management on the basin scale in arid areas.

These parameters were then normalized using Z-score technique. The Z-scores computed for each of these parameters were then used to develop a Sustainable Development Index (SDI). The index is pilot tested on different States and Union Territories (UTs) of India. The values are compared and interpreted to adjudge the forerunners and laggards on the various dimensions of human well-being and environment. Significant relationships have been observed between income levels and area of administrative regions with sustainability indices of the regions. Smaller administrative regions with higher income levels have been observed with higher sustainability scores. The proposed index provides a useful measure of identifying problematic areas that can be plugged through policy measures and ensures that the region moves on sustainable development pathways.

However, this rather tricky term is open to a number of interpretations ranging from strong/ecological to weak/technocratic. In the context of an old industrial region, evidence of movement towards strong sustainable development in four areas is discussed: radicalising democracy; promoting the local social economy; meeting basic needs; and encouraging biodiversity. The article explores why, in the light of sustained evidence of multiple social and environmental crises, these messages of strong, ecological sustainable development continue to be ignored and marginalized in formulating policy at the regional level.","Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Newcastle Univ, Ctr Urban & Reg Dev Studies, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",paul.chatterton@ncl.ac.uk,"Chatterton, Paul/A-7384-2008","Chatterton, Paul/0000-0001-9281-2230",,,,,74,22,22,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

High-resolution images (0.53 m) of 2005, 2010, and 2017 and a digital elevation model as the data source were verified through a field survey. We calculated the relevant dynamic change index and used the transfer matrix and kernel density estimation to reveal the spatial temporal transition characteristics and spatial agglomeration of slope cultivated land in the trough valley area of Guizhou Province, China. Results show that the utilization of slope cultivated land is mainly dominated by gentle and oblique slope cultivated lands. From 2005 to 2017, the dynamic degree changes of slope cultivated land show their own characteristics and differences. The transition of slope cultivated land is mainly based on rural residential land, town land, fruit land, tea land, shrubland, grassland, and forested land, the transfer space is distributed in the flat position of three trough valleys, and the change in density agglomeration during 2010-2017 is higher than that during 2005-2010. Six change modes are found in the temporal and spatial variations of slope cultivated land. The difference distribution of natural factors in elevation, hydrogeology, and soil type directly leads to the significant difference in the spatial and temporal distributions of slope cultivated land. The utilization function of slope cultivated land shows diversification with the improvement of social economy and the implementation of human policies in trough valley areas.","[Wang, Quan; Li, Yangbing] Guizhou Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China; [Luo, Guangjie] Guizhou Educ Coll, Sch Geog & Tourism, Guiyang 550001, Peoples R China",Guizhou Normal University,"Wang, Q (corresponding author), Guizhou Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Environm Sci, Guiyang 550025, Peoples R China.",excellent_wangquan@126.com,,"wangquan, wangquan/0000-0002-5354-0268",National Key Research and Development Plan Project of China [2016YFC0502300]; Spatiotemporal Evolution and Driving Mechanism of Rocky Desertification in Karst Trough Valley Area [2016YFC0502301-1]; Guizhou Normal University Graduate Innovation Fund Project [YC[2018]025],National Key Research and Development Plan Project of China; Spatiotemporal Evolution and Driving Mechanism of Rocky Desertification in Karst Trough Valley Area; Guizhou Normal University Graduate Innovation Fund Project,"Special thanks to the anonymous reviewers and the editor for their useful suggestions on the manuscript.

The existing traditional heating methods cannot meet the high-quality heating demands. Although the new heating methods based on clean energy can satisfy the needs of residents in terms of energy saving, environmental protection and thermal comfort, they have not been widely used due to their high initial investment, the misunderstanding of principal functions and the perceived difficulty of application. This study firstly summarizes various available heating methods for rural areas from aspects of technical characteristics, environmental friendliness, indoor comfort, and economy. Then it gives advice for government and relevant institutions to increase publicity for new heating methods. It aims to provide a theoretical basis and feasible suggestions for the selection of heating methods for rural residents in China.

High food prices, low incomes, and limited access to nutritious perishable foods foster increased reliance on poor quality non-perishable foods. In northern Canada, Inuit experience food insecurity at over eight times the rate of the general Canadian population. This study aims to contribute to the evidence-base for informing food policy in remote northern communities by documenting food prices and investigating the economic dimensions of diet quality and nutrition in one region of Arctic Canada. A participatory food costing study was undertaken seasonally in six communities of the western Canadian Arctic during a 14-month period (late 2014 to early 2016). Community research assistants systematically collected food prices for a list of 106 market foods. Food prices in the region were markedly higher than the national average. The average cost of the Revised Northern Food Basket (to feed a family of four for one week) was CAD $410, over two times the equivalent cost of feeding a family of four in the capital city of Ottawa (CAD $192). Results from this study also provide evidence of significant price differentials between energy-dense nutrient-poor foods, and costlier nutrient-rich foods. Evidenced-based policy is needed to overcome the unique challenges of food retailing in remote northern environments. Such policies must be pursued with due recognition of community priorities and self-determination, and pursued in parallel to initiatives that enhance access to traditional (country) food.","[Kenny, Tiff-Annie; Chan, Hing Man] Univ Ottawa, Dept Biol, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Fillion, Myriam] Univ TELUQ, Dept Sci & Technol, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [MacLean, Jullian] Inuvialuit Reg Corp, Inuvik, NT, Canada; [Wesche, Sonia D.] Univ Ottawa, Dept Geog Environm & Geomat, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Quebec; Universite TELUQ; University of Ottawa,"Chan, HM (corresponding author), Gendron Hall,Room 180,30 Marie Currie, Ottawa, ON K1N 9A7, Canada.",Laurie.Chan@uOttawa.ca,,"Fillion, Myriam/0000-0002-7776-4039; Chan, Laurie/0000-0003-4351-7483; Kenny, Tiff-Annie/0000-0001-9688-6149; Wesche, Sonia/0000-0002-8300-954X",ArcticNet,ArcticNet,"We wish foremost to recognize and extend our appreciation to the community research assistants whose diligent work was instrumental to the realization of this project.

Hence, this study focuses predominantly on the structural response and performance evaluation of composite rail track slabs through 3D finite element analysis using ABAQUS. The response and performance of composite track slab subjected to derailment actions has been observed. Material strain-rate properties and impact loads have been introduced to the numerical simulation in order to investigate impact behaviours of composite slabs subjected to derailment loading in explicit dynamic analysis. Based on obtained results, it was found that 45 km/h in the direction of gravity is the limit impact velocity for the designed composite rail track slab.

It argues that emerging initiatives are relevant for shifting from a post-crisis approach to one that is more developmental. This multi-level analysis finds that UA in Portugal: embraces allotment gardens, urban farms and short food chains; deals primarily with vegetables and fruit; takes place predominantly on public and institutional land; and is championed by municipalities and to a lesser extent by civil society initiatives. UA is predominantly a metropolitan phenomenon. Furthermore, activities are organised around three pillars: production of food; simple processing and distribution; and a significant set of capacity building and training activities. UA is recent phenomena in Portugal, and it has expanded quickly since the 2008 economic crisis. The paper explores in-depth four innovative short food chains from the sample of initiatives. They are led by young entrepreneurs, make positive use of social networks, are committed to social and economic values, and expanded successfully in generating jobs at the time of the crisis. These examples strongly suggest that UA social economy enterprises are a driving force behind integrated sustainable development approaches in European cities, if and when supported by public policies.","[Delgado, Cecilia] Nova Univ Lisbon, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Delgado, C (corresponding author), Nova Univ Lisbon, Fac Social Sci & Humanities, Interdisciplinary Ctr Social Sci, Lisbon, Portugal.",cmndelgado@gmail.com,"Delgado, Cecília/AAC-3185-2019","Delgado, Cecília/0000-0003-4211-0614",Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation [SFRH/BPD/94286/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BPD/94286/2013] Funding Source: FCT,Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"The research is funded by the Portuguese Science and Technology Foundation ( FCT) grant: SFRH/BPD/94286/2013.

While some enabling elements are impossible to replicate, there are others that might be improved and could help worker cooperatives develop further: a shift away from policies that discriminate against cooperatives in terms of access to credits and the development of governmental programs that could open the public market more to these entities; a better organization of type II cooperatives and of the services they offer to their members; better public image and communication strategies, and greater investment to enhance the advocacy skills of these organizations.","[Lambru, Mihaela] Univ Bucharest, Fac Sociol & Social Work, Bucharest 010181, Romania; [Petrescu, Claudia] Romanian Acad, Res Inst Qual Life, Bucharest 050718, Romania",University of Bucharest; Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Lambru, M (corresponding author), Univ Bucharest, Fac Sociol & Social Work, Schitu Magureanu 9, Bucharest 010181, Romania.",mihaela.lambru@sas.unibuc.ro; claucaraiman@yahoo.com,"Petrescu, Claudia/C-4810-2012","Petrescu, Claudia/0000-0002-2528-675X",,,,,50,21,23,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1350-5084,1461-7323,,ORGANIZATION,Organization,SEP,2014,21,5,,,SI,,730,745,,10.1177/1350508414537807,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1350508414537807,,,16,Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,AQ2OV,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000342627600008,View Full Record in Web of Science

About 55 similar interdisciplinary altruistics researcher associations have been founded worldwide (48 described here; including 9 defunct), 25 of them national in geographic scope, but seven covering a world region and 11 global. Over 100 academic journals that publish research on altruistics or its sub-topics have been published, with 95 active ones described here. The author estimates that there are at least 8,000 active altruistics researchers worldwide, and perhaps as many as 20,000. The author devised the neologism altruistics (or alternatively, voluntaristics) to refer to all the phenomena of our field, individual and collective. Included are philanthropy, nonprofit sector, third sector, voluntary sector, civil society, social economy, volunteering, associations, and nonprofit organizations, among other topics.

Based on the meteorological data from 1961 to 2017 and crop growth period data from 1981 to 2017 in Sichuan Province, Sichuan Province was divided into seven agro-ecological zones and one non-agricultural zone according to their interregional differences and regional similarities in aspects of nature, social economy and current agricultural infrastructures. Besides, the representative station and cropping system in each region were selected. This paper evaluated the current cropping systems and cropping patterns in different agro-ecological zones of Sichuan Province by calculating the ensure index of precipitation, the yield variation coefficient, the ratio of sown area to cultivated area and the disaster resistance capability coefficient of agricultural planting areas in Sichuan Province under the background of droughts. Moreover, taking representative stations as an example, the evaluation index of cropping system optimization was put forward based on four factors, namely risk, vulnerability, exposure and the capacity of drought prevention and disaster reduction, from the perspective of the natural disaster formation mechanism. Then, a risk assessment model was established to evaluate the cropping system optimization in different agro-ecological zones of Sichuan Province. The results showed that winter wheat-maize-sweet potato (soybean) triple cropping pattern in upland is the best cropping system for the wide valley area of Southwest Sichuan (such as Panzhihua), the mountain area of Southwest Sichuan (such as Xichang), the basin-edged mountain area (such as Guangyuan) and the parallel ridge-valley area of eastern basin (such as Dazhou). Winter wheat (rape)-maize-soybean triple cropping pattern in upland is the best cropping system for the hilly area in southern basin (such as Yibin). Winter wheat (rape)-maize-soybean (sweet potato) triple cropping pattern in upland is the best cropping system for the summer-drought-prone hilly area of central basin (such as Suining). Paddy potato-upland rice rotation double cropping pattern is optimal for the Chengdu Plain under the moist climate. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The groundwater environment destruction is not just only the destruction of underground structure but also the social problems caused by available groundwater resources reduction, as well as the environmental problems affecting ecosystem and human health. Moreover, the groundwater environmental risk of coal mining is complex, dynamic, and long-term. Therefore, a framework and quantitative method for groundwater environmental risk analysis at different phases of the mine life cycle was presented, which is composed of the groundwater system destruction risk (GSDR) and social-economic-ecological vulnerability (SEEV) assessment. The framework was applied in Hongshan abandoned coal mine, North China. Based on the aquifer structure destruction, groundwater flow field evolution, contamination, and social-economic influence analysis, 12 main controlling factors for the GSDR and 7 factors for the SEEV were determined and quantified separately. The results showed that the groundwater contamination of the Hongshan mine mainly occurred after closure, caused by the cross-strata pollution of mine water, which significantly reduced the groundwater available resources, which greatly affected local social-economy sustainable development and residents' health. The Hongshan mine closure increased groundwater environmental risk, with the GSDR high-risk zone being 12.51 km(2)larger than that during the mining phase and the SEEV was calculated at a high level. This framework promotes systematic integration of the groundwater environmental risk assessment in mine life cycle.","[Feng, Haibo; Zhou, Jianwei; Chai, Bo; Zhou, Aiguo; Li, Jianzhong; Zhu, Henghua; Chen, Hongnian; Su, Danhui] China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Li, Jianzhong] Minist Nat Resources Peoples Republ China, Dept Natl Spatial Ecol Rehabil, Beijing 100812, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Henghua] Shandong Inst Geol Survey, Jinan 250013, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hongnian] Shandong Lunan Inst Geol Engn Survey, Yanzhou 272100, Shandong, Peoples R China",China University of Geosciences; Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,"Zhou, JW (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Environm Studies, Wuhan 430074, Hubei, Peoples R China.",jw.zhou@cug.edu.cn,"su, dan/GYJ-1940-2022; Su, Danhui/IUN-7025-2023","Su, Danhui/0000-0003-1699-2676; ZHOU, Jianwei/0000-0003-4952-4641",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41572344],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41572344).,,66,20,24,22,135,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0944-1344,1614-7499,,ENVIRON SCI POLLUT R,Environ.

For sustainable water use and rapid drought response, it is very meaningful to explore the correlation between meteorological drought and hydrological drought. This paper investigates the features of drought evolution based on cross wavelet transform (XWT) and mutual entropy. The meteorological drought was measured by the standardized precipitation index (SPI), while the hydrological drought was evaluated by the standardized runoff index (SRI). The research data were collected from hydrological stations and meteorological stations in the Yellow River basin of Henan Province, China. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Both meteorological drought and hydrological drought had obvious periodicity, especially on the scale of 2-4a. (2) The evolution of meteorological drought varied greatly from place to place; through the study period, Henan province did not suffer any extreme drought, though the drought situation in the western region has an aggravating trend. (3) Hydrological drought has a strong positive correlation with meteorological drought, and generally lagged behind meteorological drought by 1-2 months in the study area. The research results lay a good basis for drought response in the Yellow River basin. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The purpose of this study is to promote AWP through optimally allocating limited agricultural water resources with the coordination of related elements. Firstly, the coordination effects of multiple factors related to AWP are quantified as relative optimum membership degrees based on the fuzzy optimum selecting theory. Secondly, based on the relative optimum membership degrees for various crops, a linear fractional programming model is established to maximize AWP in agricultural water resources allocation. Thirdly, the impacts of the allocation schemes on the development of social-economy and ecological environment are discussed using the multi-dimensional regulation theory. The developed integrated system has advantages in increasing agricultural water productivity through the coordination of multiple factors with aspects of economy, society and resources. Moreover, the system is capable of screening schemes considering harmonious development of resources, economy, society and ecology based on optimization results, providing decision makers with more sustainable schemes for irrigation water allocation. The integrated system including the aforementioned three parts is applied to a real-world case study in China to demonstrate its feasibility and applicability. Different water allocation schemes for various crops under different scenarios were obtained. The average value of AWP is 1.85 kg/m(3), which is 0.31 kg/m(3) higher than the current value of AWP. An optimum scheme with 1.1405 x 10(8) m(3) of water being allocated was also selected due to its highest level of coordination for resources, economy, society and ecology. The developed system can provide an effective method for AWP promotion. The obtained results can help local decision makers adjust water resources allocation schemes.","[Zhao, Jianming; Li, Mo; Guo, Ping; Zhang, Chenglong; Tan, Qian] China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Guo, P (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",zjm88918@126.com; limo0205@126.com; guop@cau.edu.cn; zhangcl1992@cau.edu.cn; qian_tan@cau.edu.cn,"Zhang, Cheng/GRS-8698-2022; Zhang, Cheng/JAC-5078-2023; Li, Yan/JUU-5189-2023; Zhang, Cheng/JAD-2236-2023; zhang, cl/JDW-6549-2023","Zhang, Cheng/0000-0003-3537-0434; Zhang, Chenglong/0000-0002-9972-6981",Governmental Public Industry Research Special Funds for Projects of Ministry of Water Resources [201501017]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51439006],Governmental Public Industry Research Special Funds for Projects of Ministry of Water Resources; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was supported by the Governmental Public Industry Research Special Funds for Projects of Ministry of Water Resources (No. 201501017) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (51439006).,,43,20,20,3,36,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2017,9,7,,,,,,,490,10.3390/w9070490,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w9070490,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,FC2PY,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000406681700041,View Full Record in Web of Science

The ocean occupies 70% of the Earth's surface and is intimately related to the regulation of climate, fostering of life, and also to social economy, as well as sports and leisure. Students in the senior years of primary education are in a phase of developing value systems. Concurrently, these students are also constantly using the Earth's resources. More importantly, they will play leading roles in the next generation. From the perspective of education, the learning status of student's cognition, attitudes, and behaviors regarding protection of the marine environment must be understood more clearly to avoid future mismanagement of marine environmental problems on the part of these students. Hence, this study uses correlative, regressive, and path statistical analysis to examine data collected from questionnaires. Results show that student knowledge of and attitudes toward marine environmental protection do not have significant influences on behaviors; however, student's marine environmental protection knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors are all within the medium to high range. Because of relatively low student curricular involvement, and because involvement has no correlation with knowledge performance, this study infers that school curricula are not the main sources of student information and attitudes regarding marine environmental protection. Rather, building student attitudes toward marine environmental protection by increasing their involvement in field trips indirectly influences behaviors that are protective of the marine environment. Such an approach is comparatively more effective and can serve as a reference for modifying the implementation methods of marine protection curricula.","[Wen, Wen-cheng; Lu, Shiau-yun] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Environm & Engn, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University,"Wen, WC (corresponding author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Marine Environm & Engn, 70 Lianhai Rd, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.",D985040009@student.nsysu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,20,21,0,65,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4622,1469-5871,,ENVIRON EDUC RES,Environ.

In Romania, although forms of social economy existed for a very long time in society, we can not speak of an institutionally or juridical determined area, with actual outputs. This study(5) shows the stage of social economy development taking into consideration three forms of social economy which are present in Romania: the cooperatives, the non-governmental organisations and the mutual aid organisations. The three types of organisations have a low potential for social economy activities. There is no specific legislative framework which to encourage the development of social economy activities, while the availability of the public institutions to support the organisations addressing the vulnerable groups is very limited. The cases in which the three forms of social economy address directly the higher employment of the disadvantaged groups are rather isolated. As a general characteristic, except for the NGOs, the other types of social economy organisations address indirectly the disadvantaged groups, without any kind of coherent supply of services.","[Arpinte, Daniel] Acad Romana, Res Inst Qual Life, Bucharest, Romania; [Cace, Sorin] Acad Romana, Inst Qual Life Res ICCV, Bucharest, Romania; [Cojocaru, Stefan] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Work, Iasi, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; Romanian Academy of Sciences; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Arpinte, D (corresponding author), Acad Romana, Res Inst Qual Life, 13 Calea,13 Septembrie,Dist 5, Bucharest, Romania.",arpinte@gmail.com; corsorin@clicknet.ro; stefan.cojocaru@holtis.ro,"Cace, Sorin/E-8868-2011; CACE, SORIN/J-8126-2016; Arpinte, Daniel/AAQ-1367-2021; Cojocaru, Stefan/A-2035-2009","CACE, SORIN/0000-0002-1177-1236; Arpinte, Daniel/0000-0002-7305-8065; Cojocaru, Stefan/0000-0003-4873-5340",,,,,8,20,20,0,23,"EDITURA LUMEN, IASI",IASI,"HOLT ROMANIA FCSSCF FILIALA, IASI STR BISTRITA, NR 7, BL B13, PARTER, AP 3, IASI, 00000, ROMANIA",1583-3410,,,REV CERCET INTERV SO,Rev.

The research method used involves a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Data were obtained by observation, in-depth interviews, surveys, and documentation. The results of the study show that spatial transformation has an impact on changing the single social formations of local communities into multiple social formations and transforming differences in modes of production between migrants and local communities into changes in the order of life of local communities. These changing interactions and social adaptations cause changes in the social structures and cultural patterns of local communities. Furthermore, changes in spatial use, social formation, and job differentiation have a significant effect on the socio-economic sustainability of local communities, with a coefficient of determination of 97.7%.

By utilizing social innovation approach that explores the relationship between causes for human needs and emergence of socially innovative food initiatives, the article examines how the CSA projects emerge and why, what is their innovative role as part of the social economy and what is their transformative potential. Based on qualitative data from four different models of CSA case studies in different regions of Wales, UK, and by using concepts from an alternative model for social innovation (ALMOLIN) as analytical tool, the article demonstrates that the Welsh CSA cases play distinctive roles as part of the social economy. They satisfy the needs for ecologically sound and ethically produced food, grown within communities of like-minded people and they empower individuals and communities at micro level, while at the same time experiment with how to be economically sustainable and resilient on a small scale. The paper argues that in order to become 'workable utopias', the CSA initiatives need to overcome the barriers that prevent them from replicating, participating in policies and decision-making at macro level, and scaling up.","[Mert-Cakal, Tezcan] Cardiff Univ Alumna, 48 St James Court, Altrincham WA15 8FG, Greater Manches, England; [Miele, Mara] Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, Wales",Cardiff University,"Miele, M (corresponding author), Cardiff Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, Wales.",tezcanmert@yahoo.com; mielem@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Mert-Cakal, Tezcan/0000-0002-5129-2643",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors are grateful to the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) for funding this research.

This poses a severe threat to public health and a heavy burden to social economy. It is therefore important to develop effective approaches to prevent or slow down the pathogenesis and progression of macrovascular complications of diabetes (MCD). Oxidative stress is a major contributor to MCD. Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) governs cellular antioxidant defence system by activating the transcription of various antioxidant genes, combating diabetes-induced oxidative stress. Accumulating experimental evidence has demonstrated that NRF2 activation protects against MCD. Structural inhibition of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) is a canonical way to activate NRF2. More recently, novel approaches, such as activation of theNfe2l2gene transcription, decreasing KEAP1 protein level by microRNA-induced degradation ofKeap1mRNA, prevention of proteasomal degradation of NRF2 protein and modulation of other upstream regulators of NRF2, have emerged in prevention of MCD. This review provides a brief introduction of the pathophysiology of MCD and the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of MCD. By reviewing previous work on the activation of NRF2 in MCD, we summarize strategies to activate NRF2, providing clues for future intervention of MCD. Controversies over NRF2 activation and future perspectives are also provided in this review.","[Wu, Junduo] Second Hosp Jilin Univ, Dept Cardiol, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Sun, Xiaodan] Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Cheeloo Coll Med, Intens Care Unit, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Ziping] First Hosp Jilin Univ, Dept Hand & Foot Surg, Changchun, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Jun] Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Cheeloo Coll Med, Dept Neurosurg, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Xu, Linlin] Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Cheeloo Coll Med, Dept Neurol, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Tian, Ao; Sun, Xuechun; Meng, Huali; Wu, Hao] Shandong Univ, Cheeloo Coll Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr & Food Hyg, 44 Wenhua Xi Rd, Jinan 250012, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Ying] Beihua Univ, Dept Dermatol, Affiliated Hosp, Jilin, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Huang, Wenlin] Georgia Gwinnett Coll, Sch Sci & Technol, Lawrenceville, GA USA; [Jia, Ye] Beckman Res Inst City Hope, Duarte, CA USA",Jilin University; Shandong University; Jilin University; Shandong University; Shandong University; Shandong University; Beihua University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Gwinnett College; City of Hope; Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope,"Wu, H (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Cheeloo Coll Med, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr & Food Hyg, 44 Wenhua Xi Rd, Jinan 250012, Shandong, Peoples R China.",hwu@sdu.edu.cn,"xu, Linlin/JCF-2403-2023; XU, Lin/HZL-5726-2023; XU, Lin/JDM-5554-2023","XU, Lin/0000-0003-1781-1638; Wu, Hao/0000-0001-5738-4015","Cheeloo Young Scholar Program of Shandong University [21320089963054]; Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong Province [2019GSF108147]; Youth Talent Fund of The Second Hospital of Shandong University [2018YT09]; Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province [2018SCZWSZX-045, JJKH20180362KJ]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81901106, 81973031]",Cheeloo Young Scholar Program of Shandong University; Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong Province; Youth Talent Fund of The Second Hospital of Shandong University; Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Cheeloo Young Scholar Program of Shandong University, Grant/Award Number: 21320089963054; Key Technology Research and Development Program of Shandong Province, Grant/Award Number: 2019GSF108147; Youth Talent Fund of The Second Hospital of Shandong University, Grant/Award Number: 2018YT09; Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province, Grant/Award Number: 2018SCZWSZX-045 and JJKH20180362KJ; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Number: 81901106 and 81973031",,99,19,19,6,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1582-1838,1582-4934,,J CELL MOL MED,J.

The Guizhou Province in China is characterized by frequent droughts, fragile mountain ecosystems and poverty. We used Guizhou Province as an example and analyzed the impacts of drought on freshwater ecosystem services. The results showed that the water yield and soil retention in Guizhou decreased due to the influence of annual and seasonal droughts. Annual droughts led to an increase in nutrient retention whereas seasonal droughts caused an increase or decrease in nutrient retention in the study area. The water yield and nutrient retention exhibited decreasing and increasing trends respectively with an increase in the degree of drought. However, changes in the soil retention in Guizhou had a week correlation with the degree of drought. There was a synergistic relationship between water yield and soil retention under the impacts of annual and seasonal droughts in Guizhou. Tradeoffs between water yield and nutrient retention, as well as between soil retention and nutrient retention, existed under the influence of annual drought. Nevertheless, tradeoffs or synergies between water yield and nutrient retention, as well as between soil retention and nutrient retention, were found under the influences of seasonal droughts. The results of this study provide science- based information for alleviating the adverse effects of drought on freshwater ecosystem services and contribute to the scientific management of freshwater ecosystem services.

Drawing on the case of Greece, this paper contends that these discussions fall short in uncovering the social impact of the European crisis and austerity politics introduced since 2010. In adding to debates that call for nuanced approached to crises, through the very forms and means people and communities contest and subvert these 'from below', the paper discusses solidarity, its meaning and practices, in constructing resistance to austerity and grassroots creativity. In particular, it shows how solidarity initiatives and networks have acted as survival means in the face of a social reproduction crisis for vulnerable social groups and, at the same time, opened up spaces for political struggle against austerity to unfold. Furthermore, it interrogates the formation of a social/solidarity economy as an alternative platform for re-instituting socio-economic relations in an era of austerity. Finally, through reflecting upon the role of the solidarity movement, the paper critically assesses their potential in foregrounding a political project of social transformation, in-the-making and still at stake. The article draws on engaged ethnographic research, conducted in Athens, Greece, between 2012 and 2013.","[Arampatzi, Athina] Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Arampatzi, A (corresponding author), Univ Leeds, Sch Geog, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England.",a.arampatzi@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,19,20,0,16,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1472-4790,1740-388X,,COMP EUR POLIT,Comp.

While much of the research has focused on its economic aspects, there are also practices that have gone largely unnoticed. This article illustrates the range of these practices by proposing a typology that accounts for the various currencies exchanged and digital technologies used to promote sharing of goods and services. This article focuses on the social aspects of the collaborative consumption movement to construct a full picture of the concept. It presents a case study of an Australian grassroots community group, MamaBake, which promotes the communal cooking and sharing of meals between mothers, and shows that even non-monetary currencies, such as the shared norms of reciprocity used by MamaBake, can be stigmatizing under certain circumstances. In doing so, it imagines alternative manifestations of the collaborative consumption movement that go beyond market orientation and instead focuses on promoting soft, non-economic values.","[Rowe, Pia C.

These DHSEEs complemented the supply of public services delivered by the Quebec state, thus de facto taking part in the dynamics of co-production of services in the context of a mixed economy including the third sector. However, beyond that co-production, these enterprises also have to position themselves in a process of co-construction with the state, that is, in the joint, partnership-oriented construction of public policy, which provides the framework for their participation in services of public interest. Analysis of this public policy thus shows that the situation of DHSEEs in Quebec has swung, depending on the period, between co-production and various types of co-construction. A number of restrictive budget policies and subcontracting practices adopted by the Quebec state, along with tensions among DHSEE groups, curtailed the development of a genuine co-construction process during the 2000s.","[Jette, Christian] Univ Montreal, Sch Social Work, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Vaillancourt, Yves] Univ Quebec, Sch Social Work, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada",Universite de Montreal; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal,"Jetté, C (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Sch Social Work, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",christian.jette@umontreal.ca,,,,,,,44,19,21,2,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0957-8765,1573-7888,,VOLUNTAS,Voluntas,MAR,2011,22,1,,,,,48,69,,10.1007/s11266-010-9134-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11266-010-9134-8,,,22,Social Issues,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Issues,767ZV,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000290900700003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accounting for the range of social, economic and political circumstances in which this care is produced has become the focus of a number of academics and others theorizing the 'third sector', or the 'social economy'. However, some scholars are concerned that the increasing attention paid to the role of informal economic activity will either legitimate neoliberal state withdrawal from social reproduction or facilitate continued invasive commodification of relationships that were formerly part of social life. While these are possible dangers, J.K. Gibson-Graham's diverse economy framework and theory of community economy allow us to understand the social and economic conditions that support, rather than undermine, a caregiver's fidelity to the process of caring. Given the size of the informal caregiving sector, it would remain an important aspect of the care economy even if the United States developed a national health care system. It is important to understand informal caregivers as economic subjects, with their desires, motivations, hopes and anxieties. What emerges from my qualitative research is an understanding of informal caregivers as ethical subjects who operate best in a network of collective recognition and support. Informal caregivers are neither self-interested economic actors nor (necessarily) victims of failed social support. Rather, they are, potentially, agents of change in a new politics of health care reform.","Worcester State Coll, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Worcester, MA USA",Massachusetts System of Public Higher Education; Worcester State University,"Healy, S (corresponding author), Worcester State Coll, Dept Phys & Earth Sci, Worcester, MA USA.",stephen.healy@gmail.com,,"Healy, Stephen/0000-0002-2394-3488",,,,,50,19,22,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-369X,1360-0524,,GENDER PLACE CULT,Gend.

However, this activity is strongly linked to the availability and accessibility of fodder resources. Due to territorial processes, such as land clearance and wood harvesting, this resource is receding and pasturelands are becoming fragmented. Herders are facing new challenges to secure their livelihoods, and, in this context, fodder trees are emerging as a key resource, allowing herds to subsist up to the end of the dry season. Increasingly, trees are playing a significant part in the herders' strategies to feed their herds in time and space and to 'root' their activities to particular lands. This trend requires an analysis of the importance of fodder trees in the definition of territorial strategies operated by herders in northern Cameroon, in the context of various herding systems (nomadic herding, agro herding using transhumance, and settled agro herding). A discussion of herding strategies needed to address the decreasing access to fodder resources highlights the problems of current extensive herding systems and leads to proposed alternatives.","CIRAD, Bamako, Mali; IRAD, Garoua, Cameroon",CIRAD,"Gautier, D (corresponding author), CIRAD, BP 1813, Bamako, Mali.",denis.gautier@cirad.fr,"Gautier, Denis/E-6924-2010","Gautier, Denis/0000-0001-7648-1881",,,,,38,19,25,0,4,BLACKWELL PUBLISHING,OXFORD,"9600 GARSINGTON RD, OXFORD OX4 2DQ, OXON, ENGLAND",0016-7398,,,GEOGR J,Geogr.

The watershed ecosystem is a social-economic-natural complex, in which the natural system is the basis, the economic system is the driving force, and the social system is the roof. (3) The scientific basis of a watershed's ecosystem is watershed ecology. Watershed ecology can be defined as a new ecological subject which regards watershed as a study unit: dynamics of information, energy and material among upland, riparian zones and waters by means of the theories and methods of modern ecology, mathematics and physics. (4) Main content and aim of watershed ecology is taking inland waters and its catchment as the study object. Research contents denote the relationship between patterns and processes of watershed ecosystems and scale coherence; searching ecosystem functions and maintaining the mechanism of watershed biodiversity; setting up mathematical models and management information systems of watershed ecosystem; providing scientific foundations for the development of rational utilization and conservation of watershed and sustainable development of the region's society and economy. (5) Rational utilization and development of water resources has a special status and importance in watershed ecosystem management; water resources should include four key elements: water quantity, water quality, water power and aquatic organisms. (6) Correct decision of watershed ecosystem management needs accurate scientific data and information.

The occurrence and intervention of HCCs has been originated in duel context of the environment and social economy. In the Sanjiangyuan region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, human-bear conflict (HBC) has emerged as a severe problem. Damages caused by Tibetan brown bears (Ursus arctos pruinosus) seriously threaten the livelihood and safety of local herders, decreasing community tolerance for brown bear conservation. A systematic field survey of HBC occurrences was undertaken in Zhiduo county of the Sanjiangyuan region in summer 2019. We surveyed 312 families via semi-structured interviews to understand the factors that contributed towards the likelihood of bear damage, representative conflict types, seasonal variation in damage occurrence, and mitigation measures deployed. The results showed that incidents of bear damage in the Sanjiangyuan region have elevated as a consequence of changes in the nomadic lifestyle of local herders. It is in part connected with simultaneous recovery of bear numbers following the conservation measures applied. Despite the widespread incidence of HBCs, with almost all respondents (n = 288, 92.31%) reporting occurrences of bear damage, most home damages were not compensated, and programs for such were lacking. Through the survey of the expected compensation types of local respondents, it was concluded that HBCs need to be mediated and resolved by integrated compensation schemes, physical and chemical prevention measures, and community development plans. Particularly, the local government should pay more attention to reducing family dependence on animal husbandry and transforming livelihood strategies into replaceable economic practices unrelated to grazing. These include things like ecological public welfare jobs and brown bear viewing ecotourism. (C) 2020 The Authors.

The accurate assessment of the amount of compensation is the key factor in the implementation of ecological compensation schemes. However, due to the complex and various ecological and environmental problems caused by groundwater overexploitation, there is no scientific quantitative method. Emergy theory is a new method to quantitatively study the relationship between environmental resources and social economy. Based on the literature review of ecological compensation for groundwater overexploitation, this paper puts forward a new evaluation method for using emergy loss as groundwater overexploitation ecological compensation. The emergy system diagram of environmental problems caused by overexploitation of groundwater is constructed. And the calculation methods of the emergy loss of eco-environmental problems caused by groundwater overexploitation, such as land subsidence (collapse), salt water intrusion, surface runoff reduction, vegetation deterioration, and groundwater pollution, were presented, respectively. Taking Zhengzhou as an example, the total amount of ecological compensation for groundwater overexploitation in 2014 was equivalent to 853 x 10(6) US dollars. The largest loss of land subsidence is 816 x 10(6) US dollars, which accounts for 95.64% of the total loss. It can be seen that land subsidence is the most serious in the eco-environmental problems caused by overexploitation of groundwater in Zhengzhou.","[Lv, Cuimei; Ling, Minhua; Wu, Zening; Guo, Xi; Cao, Qianqian] Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Water Conservancy & Environm, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China",Zhengzhou University,"Ling, MH (corresponding author), Zhengzhou Univ, Sch Water Conservancy & Environm, Zhengzhou 450001, Henan, Peoples R China.",366357398@qq.com,"Cao, Qianqian/IAQ-5629-2023; Ling, Minhua/T-8711-2019","Ling, Minhua/0000-0001-6625-4490","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51739009, 51609216] Funding Source: Medline; Henan natural science foundation [182300410139] Funding Source: Medline",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Henan natural science foundation,,,32,18,22,7,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0269-4042,1573-2983,,ENVIRON GEOCHEM HLTH,Environ.

However, the lack of direct human activity information invariably restricts the accuracy of population mapping and reduces the credibility of the mapping process even when external facility distribution information is adopted. To address these problems, the present study proposed a novel population mapping method by combining International Space Station (ISS) photography nighttime light data, point of interest (POI) data, and location-based social media data. A similarity matching model, consisting of semantic and distance matching models, was established to integrate POI and social media data. Effective information was extracted from the integrated data through principal component analysis and then used along with road density information to train the random forest (RF) model. A comparison with WordPop data proved that our method can generate fine-resolution population distribution with higher accuracy (R2=0.91) than those of previous studies (R2=0.55). To illustrate the advantages of our method, we highlighted the limitations of previous methods that ignore social media data in handling residential regions with similar light intensity. We also discussed the performance of our method in adopting social media data, considering their characteristics, with different volumes and acquisition times. Results showed that social media data acquired between 19:00 and 8:00 with a volume of approximately 300,000 will help our method realize high accuracy with low computation burden. This study showed the great potential of combining social sensing data for disaggregating fine-resolution population.","[Wang, Luyao; Fan, Hong] Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Luyao; Fan, Hong] Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yankun] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Architecture & Urban Planning, Res Inst Smart Cities, Shenzhen 518061, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yankun] Shenzhen Key Lab Spatial Informat Smart Sensing &, Shenzhen 518061, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yankun] Guangdong Key Lab Urban Informat, Shenzhen 518061, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Shenzhen University,"Fan, H (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, State Key Lab Informat Engn Surveying Mapping & R, 129 Luoyu Rd, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Fan, H (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Geospatial Technol, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",hfan3@whu.edu.cn,"Wang, Luyao/HKO-6458-2023","Wang, Luyao/0000-0002-5274-7857","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471323, 41661086, 91746206]; National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0503500]; Science and Technology Development Project of Guizhou Province Tobacco Corporation of China National Tobacco Corporation [201407]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); National Key Research and Development Program of China; Science and Technology Development Project of Guizhou Province Tobacco Corporation of China National Tobacco Corporation,"This research was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 41471323 41661086 and 91746206, National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2017YFB0503500, the Science and Technology Development Project of Guizhou Province Tobacco Corporation of China National Tobacco Corporation, contract number 201407.",,78,18,21,2,39,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-4292,,REMOTE SENS-BASEL,Remote Sens.,AUG,2019,11,16,,,,,,,1900,10.3390/rs11161900,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11161900,,,25,"Environmental Sciences; Geosciences, Multidisciplinary; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Geology; Remote Sensing; Imaging Science & Photographic Technology,IV6OL,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000484387600063,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on data on these two factors for Gansu Province from 1998 to 2017, we used the Tapio decoupling model to evaluate the decoupling relationship between land use intensity and ecological environment. From 1998 to 2017, the comprehensive land use intensity in Gansu province increased by 107.77%, and the comprehensive ecological environment index increased by 63.76%. In general, the relationship between land use intensity and ecological environment experienced five states, namely weak decoupling, strong negative decoupling, strong decoupling, expansive negative decoupling, and declining decoupling. During 1999-2013 and 2013-2016, land use intensity and ecological environment had decoupled, and the main reasons were as follows: (1) The Chinese government introduced a series of farmland protection policies and measures, controlled the area of newly added construction land, and reduced urban land expansion; (2) ecological restoration projects for mountains, forests, fields, lakes, and grassland strengthened the environmental protection in Gansu Province; and (3) in the process of economic development, the increased investment of technology and capital improved the land use efficiency, finally realizing the double growth of land use intensity and environmental quality. Based on these results, land use intensity and environmental quality are not necessarily contradictory, and a moderate improvement of land use efficiency and environmental protection can probably result in increased land use intensity and higher environmental quality.","[Zhang, Yanjie; Song, Wei; Yang, Dazhi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yanjie] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Tourism & Urban Rural Planning, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Fu, Shun] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Management Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chengdu University of Technology; Chengdu University of Technology","Song, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Fu, S (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Management Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",zhangyanjie_cdlg@yeah.net; songw@igsnrr.ac.cn; fs@cdut.edu.cn; yangdazhi@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Song, Wei/E-8333-2018","Song, Wei/0000-0003-4039-2339; Yang, Dazhi/0000-0002-9626-6879","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0603]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671177]; Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602402, 2018YFC1508801]; Project from Development Research Center of State Administration for Market Regulation, China","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of China; Project from Development Research Center of State Administration for Market Regulation, China","This research was funded by the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (Grant No. 2019QZKK0603), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41671177), the Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2016YFA0602402 and 2018YFC1508801) and the Project from Development Research Center of State Administration for Market Regulation, China (entitled Research on the analysis framework on quality safety situation).",,42,17,18,15,90,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2020,12,7,,,,,,,2779,10.3390/su12072779,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12072779,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LL4WR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000531558100204,View Full Record in Web of Science

This has become one of the key factors that restricts the sustainable development of the social economy and ecological environment of the region. The water network system of the Songhua, Liaohe, Yellow, and Haihe river basins is analyzed by using ecological network analysis for the period 2004-2017. According to our findings, the network structures of various river basins present a relevant gap from its equilibrium value; thus, the water resources have not reached the state of sustainable use. By comparing the value of the water system in Songliao, Yellow, and Haihe river basins with a(opt), we found that only the water network structure of the Songliao River Basin is close to the point of equilibrium. Therefore, we recommend to improve water-use efficiency and reduce production and domestic water consumption by adjusting water prices, carrying out agricultural water-saving irrigation, and increasing the use of industrial circulating water. This set of measures would ensure sufficient ecological water consumption in the basin, in order to meet the needs of a healthy and sustainable development of the ecological environment.","[Lu, Shibao; Tang, Yao] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Adm, Hangzhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoling] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiaoling] City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China","Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics; City University of Hong Kong; City University of Hong Kong; Shenzhen Research Institute, City University of Hong Kong","Zhang, XL (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Publ Policy, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.;Zhang, XL (corresponding author), City Univ Hong Kong, Shenzhen Res Inst, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",xiaoling.zhang@cityu.edu.hk,"Zhang, Xiaoling/AAT-4748-2020; Zhang, Xiaoling/AAT-4795-2020","Zhang, Xiaoling/0000-0002-6369-9424","New Type Key Think Tank of Zhejiang Province; Zhejiang Province Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists [LR15E090002]; CityU Internal Funds [9610386, 9680195]; Research Grants Council [CityU 21209715, CityU 11271716]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371187, 71673232, 71834005, 51379219]",New Type Key Think Tank of Zhejiang Province; Zhejiang Province Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists; CityU Internal Funds; Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"New Type Key Think Tank of Zhejiang Province; Zhejiang Province Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists, Grant/Award Number: LR15E090002; CityU Internal Funds, Grant/Award Numbers: 9610386, 9680195; Research Grants Council, Grant/Award Numbers: CityU 21209715, CityU 11271716; National Natural Science Foundation of China, Grant/Award Numbers: 41371187, 71673232, 71834005, 51379219",,31,17,17,7,40,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0968-0802,1099-1719,,SUSTAIN DEV,Sustain.

For this aim, we conducted 43 in-depth interviews with social entrepreneurs, launched a web-based survey with 90 responses, and built a database with 347 organizations and/or ventures settled in Catalonia with an explicit social/environmental goal. The data show that many social/environmental initiatives emerged during the economic crisis, either as a self-employment alternative to unemployment, or as a commercial venture started by nonprofit organizations as a reaction to the reduction in public expense in this sector. In addition, the crisis fueled the emergence of ventures oriented to non-market exchange and social currencies. As a whole, we argue that this new reality can be conceptualized as the emergence of an unsettled Strategic Action Field where banks, business schools and public administrations alike promote the label of social entrepreneurship through awards and startup services, whereas other groups claiming the same social/environmental goals contest this market-oriented definition of the field.","[Luis Molina, Jose; Valenzuela-Garcia, Hugo; Lubbers, Miranda J.; Escribano, Paula; Lobato, Marta M.] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Social & Cultural Anthropol, GRAFO, Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Molina, JL (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Social & Cultural Anthropol, GRAFO, Barcelona, Spain.",joseluis.molina@uab.cat,"García, Hugo Valenzuela/H-9705-2015; Molina, José Luis/A-7463-2008; Escribano, Paula/AAZ-6895-2020; Lubbers, Miranda Jessica/P-1250-2018; Molina, José Luis/ABC-6391-2020","García, Hugo Valenzuela/0000-0002-6195-9149; Molina, José Luis/0000-0002-2932-2690; Escribano, Paula/0000-0002-4635-3325; Lubbers, Miranda Jessica/0000-0001-8398-6044; Molina, José Luis/0000-0002-2932-2690",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [MINECO-CSO2012-32635]; La Caixa Foundation [CAIXA13-01],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); La Caixa Foundation(La Caixa Foundation),"This research has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO-CSO2012-32635), and La Caixa Foundation (CAIXA13-01).",,42,17,18,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0957-8765,1573-7888,,VOLUNTAS,Voluntas,AUG,2018,29,4,,,,,725,739,,10.1007/s11266-017-9921-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11266-017-9921-6,,,15,Social Issues,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Issues,GV7YO,,Green Accepted,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000446351400009,View Full Record in Web of Science

All of which greatly affect water resource and the development of social economy. In this study, we take extreme precipitation events in the Midwest of Jilin Province as an example; daily precipitation data during 1960-2014 are used. The threshold of extreme precipitation events is defined by multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) method. Extreme precipitation (EP), extreme precipitation ratio (EPR), and intensity of extreme precipitation (EPI) are selected as the extreme precipitation indicators, and then the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test is employed to determine the optimal probability distribution function of extreme precipitation indicators. On this basis, copulas connect nonparametric estimation method and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) method is adopted to determine the bivariate copula function. Finally, we analyze the characteristics of single variable extremum and bivariate joint probability distribution of the extreme precipitation events. The results show that the threshold of extreme precipitation events in semi-arid areas is far less than that in subhumid areas. The extreme precipitation frequency shows a significant decline while the extreme precipitation intensity shows a trend of growth; there are significant differences in spatiotemporal of extreme precipitation events. The spatial variation trend of the joint return period gets shorter from the west to the east.

Based on the datasets from 2000 to 2015, we forecast the SDGS in Beijing under multiple scenarios based on real-world policies using a system dynamics model. We found that the historical SDGS value increased to its highest level in 2012, but declined slightly by 2015. Second, the forecasted SDGS values declined over time in all scenarios, but the decline was greater in scenarios placing a high priority on economic development. In these scenarios, the performance of the indices only improved in certain subsystems.

The establishment of a monitoring system of FI becomes a priority for food and nutrition policies. Our study aims to evaluate FI trends during the economic crisis in Portugal and to identify regional disparities throughout the country. Data derived from three surveys conducted by the Portuguese Directorate-General of Health, concerning FI of the Portuguese population, during the period that Portugal was under the International Monetary Fund financial assistance program (2011-2013). Data were collected by face-to-face interviews and FI was evaluated using a psychometric scale. Logistic regression models were used to identify regional disparities in FI. The prevalence of FI was relatively unchanged at national and regional levels, during the analysis period. Data from 2013 indicates a high prevalence of FI (50.7%), including 33.4% for low FI, 10.1% for moderate FI and 7.2% for severe FI. Disparities according health region were also found for household FI. Algarve, Lisboa and Vale do Tejo were the two regions with the highest levels of FI, even after controlling for other socioeconomic variables. High levels of FI found in Portugal and the different regional profiles suggest the need for regional strategies, in particular in the most affected regions based on a broader action with different policy sectors (health, social security, municipalities and local institutions in the field of social economy).","[Gregorio, Maria Joao; Graca, Pedro] Univ Porto, Sch Nutr & Food Sci, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Graca, Pedro] Directorate Gen Hlth, Natl Program Promot Hlth Eating, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Costa, Andreia] Directorate Gen Hlth, Santiago De Compostela, Spain; [Nogueira, Paulo Jorge] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Inst Med Prevent & Saude Publ, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Nogueira, Paulo Jorge] Directorate Gen Hlth, Natl Serv Anal & Informat, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Lisboa,"Nogueira, PJ (corresponding author), Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Inst Med Prevent & Saude Publ, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal.",mariajoaobg@fcna.up.pt; pedrograca@dgs.pt; andreiasilva@dgs.pt; paulo.nogueira@dgs.pt,"Nogueira, Paulo Jorge/AAR-5605-2020; Nogueira, Paulo/HDL-7482-2022; Gregorio, Maria Joao/AAI-2085-2021; da Costa, Andreia Jorge Silva/ABE-5195-2020","Nogueira, Paulo Jorge/0000-0001-8316-5035; Gregorio, Maria Joao/0000-0002-0380-7833; Costa, Andreia/0000-0002-2727-4402",,,,,43,17,21,1,13,"UNIV SAO PAULO, FAC SAUDE PUBLICA",SAO PAULO,"AV DR ARNALDO 715, PREDIO DA BIBLIOTECA 2 ANDAR SALA 2, SAO PAULO, SP 01246 904, BRAZIL",0104-1290,,,SAUDE SOC-SAO PAULO,Saude Soc.,OCT-DEC,2014,23,4,,,,,1127,1141,,10.1590/S0104-12902014000400001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0104-12902014000400001,,,15,"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),"Public, Environmental & Occupational Health",AZ4NQ,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000348199600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the context of road bridges, their functional failure often causes serious impact on safety and logistics, which could turn out to be detrimental to the social economy. To appropriately maintain a huge number of aging infrastructures, a strategic maintenance program, facilitating both the global-and local-diagnosis approaches, that is effective in assessing early damage is of high demand. In this study, fatigue damage of concrete bridge decks, which is a common form of deterioration among bridges, was examined by sensitive nondestructive testing methods utilizing propagation of stress waves. Specifically, the fatigue damage process of concrete decks due to repeated traffic loads is visualized by means of active and passive elastic wave techniques, namely the elastic wave tomography and acoustic emission techniques. In the experiment, a full-scale concrete deck was subjected to repeatedly moving wheel load, to induce fatigue damage to the concrete. At three stages of after initial loading, after 10,000 passage and after 20,000 passages of 150-kN wheel loading, the fatigue test was suspended temporarily, and elastic waves were transmitted into the concrete to inspect interior structure with elastic waves' velocity. Applying static load with gradual increment in magnitude, acoustic emission testing was then conducted to extract characteristic acoustic emission (AE) parameters with regard to the intrinsic damage. Promising elastic wave parameters for quantifying the damage, which have been identified through experimental studies, were later verified using in situ deck specimens hewed out from an actual bridge. These experiments showed that by using sparsely arrayed AE sensors for measurement, followed by extracting AE frequency features, global investigation of the integrity of bridge decks could be carried out. Once the area of interest was identified through analysis of AE data, detailed information such as cross-sectional damage could be visualized by employing ultrasonic testing and tomographic reconstruction procedure.

Eutrophication is generally considered to be the most important driving factor of this phenomenon. It is difficult to obtain the pressure-impact relationship between land-based loading and green tides by only surveying or monitoring, whereas modeling can perform this task easily. In this study, therefore, a hydro-biogeochemical model was established and verified by the measured hydrodynamic and water quality variables. In the initial outbreak area of Jiangsu coast, China, we studied the relationship between U. prolifera bloom and the driving factors of nutrient loads and structures by modeling different scenarios of land source inputs. It was found that the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus could be affected significantly, which triggered the bloom of U. prolifera. When the land-based input doubled or halved, the dissolved inorganic nitrogen concentration increased 20.6% or decreased 9.5%, respectively, which might result in 14.5% increase or 46.3% decrease in the green tide, respectively. It was also found that the nutrient distribution and structure was affected by the land-based load, which caused the outbreak of U. prolifera. Moreover, the total nutrient load must be controlled to prevent the outbreak of green tide in the Jiangsu coast.","[Chen, Yanan; Li, Keqiang; Gu, Linan; Wang, Xiulin] Ocean Univ China, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Key Lab Marine Chem Theory & Technol, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Song, Dehai] Ocean Univ China, Key Lab Phys Oceanog, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Song, Dehai] Qingdao Natl Lab Marine Sci & Technol, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China; [Wei, Aihong] Jiangsu Environm Monitoring Ctr, Nanjing 210000, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; Laoshan Laboratory,"Li, KQ (corresponding author), Ocean Univ China, Coll Chem & Chem Engn, Key Lab Marine Chem Theory & Technol, Minist Educ, Qingdao 266100, Peoples R China.",likeqiang@ouc.edu.cn,"Song, Dehai/N-3011-2014","Song, Dehai/0000-0002-7519-4423; li, keqiang/0000-0002-9206-0283","National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC1402101, 2017YFC1404300]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [201962008]; NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund [U1706215, U1606404]; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China [ZR2019MD010]; National Science Foundation of China [41676062]","National Key Research and Development Program of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund; Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China(Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","This study was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2016YFC1402101, 2017YFC1404300), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (201962008), the NSFC-Shandong Joint Fund (U1706215, U1606404), Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China (ZR2019MD010), and the National Science Foundation of China (41676062).

The purpose is to construct the connectivity of ecology, social economy, culture and system, and to study the management of marine protected areas (MPAs) from a broader perspective. The survey method used in this study is similar to that of 'SolVES' method, which aims to assess relative importance of social value for Marine Park and discuss people's attitudes towards the future development of Marine Park and management of Marine Park. We selected purposive sampling survey according to the occupation category, and obtained 109 and 102 valid questionnaires in PPMP and GMMP respectively. In this study, four sets of questions, including familiarity with Marine Park, attitude toward use of Marine Park, understanding of social-value of Marine Park and personal profile, were designed to analyze differences between PPMP in Malaysia and GMMP in Indonesia. For both Marine Parks Biological Diversity Value (B) was scored the highest among all ten social-values. The participation rate of marine education in both Marine Parks are relatively low; both of them are no more than 35%. Compared with locals, tourists value biodiversity more, and while comparison among different occupations, civil servants value biodiversity more than other occupations. Through on-the-spot investigation and sorting out the management problems of marine parks reflected by respondents, we found that: (a) the weakness of basic education and lack of popular science publicity and education activities have caused the level of public's awareness of environmental protection to be not high enough; (b) the relative insufficiency of tourism infrastructure and increase in number of tourists in recent years, might have caused many problems such as destroying coral reef resources and littering. Some suggestions were put forward to solve the problem: (a) promote public awareness of environmental protection through popular science publicity and education; (b) for PPMP, the restriction on the number of tourists will benefit the protection of coral, while improving infrastructure, such as garbage collection, will help improve environmental pollution; (c) for GMMP, strengthening the synergy between local and central governments will help to deal with the relationship between land use and environmental protection and highlight environmental protection functions.","[Chen, Fenggui; Wu, Jianwei; Liu, Jinwen; Hu, Yanbing; Chen, Xiaojuan] Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China; [Lim, Phaik-Eem] Univ Malaya, Inst Ocean & Earth Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Abdullah, Wan Muhammad Aznan] Dept Marine Pk Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Sjafrie, Nurul Dhewani Mirah] Indonesian Inst Sci, Res Ctr Oceanog, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Adirianto, Bobby] Gili Matra Marine Pk Management Off, Jakarta, Indonesia","Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China; Third Institute of Oceanography, Ministry of Natural Resources; Universiti Malaya; National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI)","Chen, FG (corresponding author), Minist Nat Resources, Inst Oceanog 3, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China.",chenfenggui@tio.org.cn,"LIM, Phaik Eem/B-5331-2010; Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020; Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020","LIM, Phaik Eem/0000-0001-9186-1487; Wu, Jian/0000-0001-9933-7364; Wu, Jian/0000-0002-3394-1507; Sjafrie, Nurul Dhewani Mirah/0000-0002-5166-3600","China-ASEAN Marine Cooperation Fund project named China-ASEAN Marine Protected Areas Ecosystem Management Network; Research Centre for Oceanology, Indonesian Institute of Science; Gili Matra Marine Park Management Office; Institute of Ocean and Earth Science, University of Malaya; Department of Marine Park Malaysia","China-ASEAN Marine Cooperation Fund project named China-ASEAN Marine Protected Areas Ecosystem Management Network; Research Centre for Oceanology, Indonesian Institute of Science; Gili Matra Marine Park Management Office; Institute of Ocean and Earth Science, University of Malaya; Department of Marine Park Malaysia","The authors are grateful for support provided by China-ASEAN Marine Cooperation Fund project named China-ASEAN Marine Protected Areas Ecosystem Management Network.

The deficiency of previous studies is that it is difficult to accurately grasp the direction of risk diffusion in different time periods, and to depict the intensity of risk contagion constantly. Research on causality and measurement of financial risk contagion based on nonlinear causality tests and dynamic Copula methods will help governments to allocate financial resources reasonably and effectively, thus promoting the sustainable development of the social economy and financial markets. Taking the Chinese stock market as an example, this paper evaluated the risk contagion effect between the Chinese stock market and six other stock markets including developed and emerging markets from January 2006 to December 2018. From the aspect of causality, the nonlinear Granger causality test was applied to the entire time period and the phased time periods involving specific events like the subprime mortgage crisis and the Chinese stock market crash. From the aspect of measurement, the dynamic Markov state transition Copula model was used to describe the asymmetrically dependent structure of markets, from which was derived the time-varying lower tail dependence coefficients. The results have been summarized as follows. Firstly, after the outbreak of the subprime mortgage crisis, the stock markets in developed and emerging markets unilaterally affected the Chinese stock market, indicating that China was the recipient at this stage. Then, after the outbreak of the Chinese stock market crash, the Chinese stock market had a risk contagion effect on both Japanese and Russian stock markets, indicating that China became a source of financial risk contagion within a limited area at this stage. Lastly, in terms of the degree of risk contagion, the lower tail dependence coefficients of the Chinese stock market and other markets were significantly increased after the occurrence of specific risk events, while the risk contagion degree of developed markets was higher than that of emerging markets. Policymakers can recognize and apply the characteristics of risk contagion at different stages to refrain from unreasonable institutional arrangements, thus improving the sustainability of economic development.","[Xu, Guoxiang; Gao, Wangfeng] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Xu, Guoxiang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Res Ctr Appl Stat, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Gao, WF (corresponding author), Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",xugxiang@mail.shufe.edu.cn; gaowfeng@163.sufe.edu.cn,,,Shanghai University of Finance and Economics [CXJJ-2016-427],Shanghai University of Finance and Economics,This research was funded by Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (in 2016) grant number (CXJJ-2016-427).,,62,16,16,6,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 1,2019,11,5,,,,,,,402,10.3390/su11051402,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11051402,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HQ8GA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000462661000186,View Full Record in Web of Science

With increased attention to dynamics rather than statics, the real social economy rather than ideal rational actors, and historical and institutional rather than theoretical and abstract renderings of business, industry, and the market, the institutionalists were directly concerned with problems of control, particularly those mechanisms of control available through law, politics, the state, and new technologies of legislative and administrative regulation.","[Novak, William J.] Univ Michigan, Sch Law, Law, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Novak, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Sch Law, Law, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,125,16,17,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0007-6805,2044-768X,,BUS HIST REV,Bus.

An alternative has emerged as a result of this lack of confidence. This alternative is known as ethical banking. A growing number of investors, asset managers, and financial intermediaries have incorporated sustainability considerations into their business practices. This paper discusses the origins of ethical banking and describes its primary characteristics. The goal is to determine whether ethical banking can be as profitable as conventional banking despite only investing in projects based on social values. A comparative analysis is performed to identify differences between an ethical bank (Triodos Bank) and a conventional bank (Banco Santander). The analysis was conducted to study the financial activity of both banks over a four-year period (2012-2015). The balance sheets, profit and loss accounts, liquidity ratios, indebtedness, and returns provided by both banks were analyzed. The results indicate that ethical banking is less profitable than conventional banking. Nevertheless, customers are attracted to the social investments and financial transparency that characterize ethical banking.

To monitor the characteristics of saltation activity and to calculate the threshold wind velocity and sediment discharge under field conditions have significance on the research of dust emission by wind erosion. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted over the flat sand in the hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert. One sampling system was installed on the flat sand surface at Tazhong, consisting of a meteorological tower with a height of 2 m, a piezoelectric saltation sensor (Sensit), and a Big Spring Number Eight (BSNE) sampler station. Occurrence of saltation activity was recorded every second using the Sensit. Each BSNE station consisted of five BSNE samplers with the lowest sampler at 0.05 m and the highest sampler at 1.0 m above the soil surface. Sediment was collected from the samplers every 24 h. It is found that saltation activity was detected for only 21.5% of the hours measured, and the longest period of saltation activity occurring continuously was not longer than 5 min under the field conditions. The threshold wind velocity was variable, its minimum value was 4.9 m s(-1), the maximum value was 9.2 m (s-1), and the average value was 7.0 m s(-1). The threshold wind velocity presented a positive linear increase during the measurement period. The observation site had a sediment discharge of 82.1 kg m(-1) over a period of 24 h. Based on hourly saltation counts, hourly sediment discharge was estimated. Overall, there was no obvious linear or other functional relationship between the hourly sediment discharge and wind velocity. The results show that the changes of sediment discharge do not quite depend on wind velocity.","[Yang Xinghua; He Qing; Ali, Mamtimin; Huo Wen; Liu Xinchun] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Desert Meteorol, Urumqi 830002, Peoples R China; [Yang Xinghua; He Qing; Ali, Mamtimin; Huo Wen; Liu Xinchun] Desert Atmosphere & Environm Observat Expt Taklim, Tazhong 841000, Peoples R China; [Strake, Miriam] Heidelberg Univ, D-69047 Heidelberg, Germany",China Meteorological Administration; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"He, Q (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Inst Desert Meteorol, Urumqi 830002, Peoples R China.",qinghe@idm.cn,"ZHAO, TIANLIANG/JGC-6865-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41175017, 41175140]; China Meteorological Administration [GYHY201006012]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); China Meteorological Administration,Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41175017 and 41175140) and China Meteorological Administration Special Public Welfare Research Fund (GYHY201006012).,,35,16,32,0,26,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0894-0525,2191-4788,,ACTA METEOROL SIN,Acta Meteorol.

Using selected theory relating to individuals and families in society, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding all families in their social economy, with special attention to families who experience material, social and cultural poverty. These families are vulnerable to becoming excluded families, not only propelled into a survival mode of living that evokes distinct skills and strengths in family members, but also has profound deleterious effects on both children and their parents. When child and family services encounter these excluded families, they need to respond with complex linked strategies at individual, family, network and policy levels.","[Mitchell, Gaye; Campbell, Lynda] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Hlth Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; Melbourne Bioinformatics,"Mitchell, G (corresponding author), 20 Steele St, Moonee Ponds, Vic 3039, Australia.",Gaye_Mitchell@websurf.net.au,,,,,,,65,16,17,0,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,MALDEN,"COMMERCE PLACE, 350 MAIN ST, MALDEN 02148, MA USA",1356-7500,,,CHILD FAM SOC WORK,Child Fam.

The social economy is developed in order to create an alternative economic and social space for the people excluded from life necessities and, furthermore, it is not a recent phenomenon; it relies on historical practices which have developed over several centuries in order to meet people's needs. The social economy institutions from Romania and Greece are then presented. The purpose is to show that clear regulations contribute to the acceptance of the social economy as an alternative and complementary form of producing social welfare. In order to accomplish the normative purposes of meeting life's necessities and of changing the existing social conditions, the social economy actors must start to think of themselves not as individual agents, but as belonging to a large movement acting within the continuum between the market and state intervention for welfare production.","[Cace, Sorin; Arpinte, Daniel] Romanian Acad, Res Inst Qual Life, Bucharest, Romania; [Cace, Corina] Acad Econ Studies, Teacher Training Dept, Bucharest, Romania; [Cojocaru, Stefan] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Dept Sociol & Social Work, Fac Philosophy & Social Polit Sci, Iasi, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Cace, S (corresponding author), Romanian Acad, Res Inst Qual Life, Bucharest, Romania.",corsorin@clicknet.ro; arpinte@gmail.com; corina.cace@dppd.ase.ro; contact@stefancojocaru.ro,"Arpinte, Daniel/AAQ-1367-2021; Cace, Corina/E-8968-2011; CACE, SORIN/J-8126-2016; Cace, Sorin/E-8868-2011; Cojocaru, Stefan/A-2035-2009","Cojocaru, Stefan/0000-0003-4873-5340; Arpinte, Daniel/0000-0002-7305-8065; CACE, SORIN/0000-0002-1177-1236",,,,,23,16,16,0,23,BABES-BOLYAI UNIV,CLUJ-NAPOCA,"FACULTY POLITICAL, ADMINSTRATIVE & COMMUNICATION SCIENCES, PUBLIC ADMIN DEPT, CENTER RES PUBLIC ADM, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400132, ROMANIA",1842-2845,2247-8310,,TRANSYLV REV ADM SCI,Transylv.

In recent years, due to climate change, natural disasters, such as drought and flooding, have frequently occurred in the region, which has a negative effect on the sustainable development of the social economy. Due to the lack of meteorological monitoring data in the six countries across the region, the study of the characteristics of climate change in this area is still scarce. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of climate change in the Lancang-Mekong sub-region (LMSR) during 2020-2100 based on the climatic data of CMIP5, using the linear trend rate method, cumulative anomaly method, the Mann-Kendall test, and Morlet wavelet analysis. The results showed that the annual mean temperature and annual precipitation in the LMSR increased significantly. The annual average temperature in this area increased at a rate of 0.219 degrees C/10a (p < 0.05) and 0.578 degrees C/10a (p < 0.05) in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively; the annual precipitation in the area was 29.474 mm/10a (p < 0.05) and 50.733 mm/10a (p < 0.05), respectively. The annual average temperature in the region changed abruptly from low to high temperatures in 2059 for the RCP4.5 scenario and 2063 for RCP8.5. The annual precipitation in the area changed from less to more in 2051 for the RCP4.5 scenario and 2057 for RCP8.5. The results of wavelet analysis showed that the annual mean temperature in the LMSR had no significant change period at the 95% confidence level under the scenario of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Under the scenario of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, the annual precipitation had a significant 3.5-year and 2.5-year periodicity, respectively. Extreme climate events tended to increase against the background of global warming, especially in high emission scenarios.","[Li, Han; Song, Wei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Han] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resources & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Song, W (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",lih.19s@igsnrr.ac.cn; songw@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Song, Wei/E-8333-2018","Song, Wei/0000-0003-4039-2339","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20040201]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0603]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671177, 42071233]; Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0602402, 2018YFC1508801]; Project from Development Research Center of State Administration for Market Regulation, China","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Research and Development Program of China; Project from Development Research Center of State Administration for Market Regulation, China","This research was funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDA20040201), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (Grant No. 2019QZKK0603), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 41671177 and 42071233), the Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant Nos. 2016YFA0602402 and 2018YFC1508801), and the Project from Development Research Center of State Administration for Market Regulation, China (entitled Research on the Analysis Framework on Quality Safety Situation).",,52,15,15,2,16,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2225-1154,,CLIMATE,Climate,OCT,2020,8,10,,,,,,,115,10.3390/cli8100115,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cli8100115,,,17,Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences,OH2QL,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000582413700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to analyse the qualitative data, discourse analysis was used, while supplemented by content analysis. It was found that the topics converge towards a political consumer discourse featuring three dimensions: the politics of production, the politics of localism and activism. Consumers argue that, by producing their own food according to the principles of agroecology, by looking for organic food within a local context, and by privileging community-based market channels, they are materializing alternative ideas of social economy, community and ecology. The results of this research provide a better understanding on the establishment of an alternative pathway towards the privatization of responsibility into collective action through the consumption of organic products and the way these are produced.","[Saraiva, Artur; Fernandes, Emilia; von Schwedler, Moritz] Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal",Universidade do Minho,"Saraiva, A (corresponding author), Univ Minho, Sch Econ & Management, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",artur.saraiva@academiamilitar.pt,"Fernandes, Emilia/U-1655-2019","Fernandes, Emilia/0000-0002-4594-318X; Saraiva, Artur/0000-0002-8766-6678",University of Minho,University of Minho,We are grateful to all the organic consumers who enthusiastically participated in this study and who welcomed us into their homes.

The local maximum temperatures exceeded 40 degrees C and brought great impacts to people's lives and the social economy. Using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and station data from the China Meteorological Administration, we study the characteristics and formation of this high-temperature event. The results show that a stable, deep, local, anomalous high over northern China was the main reason for this high-temperature event. A silk-road teleconnection circulation appeared in the upstream part at the midlatitudes of Eurasia and was accompanied by clear energy dispersion of an eastward midlatitude Rossby wave, which favored the divergence of wave energy over Northeast China and led to an increase in geopotential heights and the formation and maintenance of the local anomalous high in North China. Simultaneously, the northern typhoons Ampil and Jongdari had connections with the local anomalous high, generated obvious secondary meridional circulations, and amplified the downdrafts in the region of the high and the maintenance and intensification of high temperatures. Further analysis revealed that the sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean in earlier periods would initiate negative vorticity sources on the northwestern side in the high-level troposphere and have a great impact on the generation and maintenance of the high-level silk-road teleconnection.","[Lu, Chuhan; Ye, Jiaxin; Wang, Sitao; Yang, Min; Li, Qinqin; He, Wenyue; Qin, Yujing; Cai, JiaXi; Mao, Jia] Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Minist Educ,Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology,"Qin, YJ (corresponding author), Nanjing Univ Informat Sci & Technol, Key Lab Meteorol Disaster, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Forecast & Evaluat Meteoro, Minist Educ,Int Res Lab Climate & Environm Change, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",qinyujing@nuist.edu.cn,"yang, zhou/KBB-6972-2024; liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023","Yang, Min/0000-0002-1199-9695",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2019YFC1510201],National Key Research and Development Program of China,This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under contract No. 2019YFC1510201.,,33,15,16,8,41,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-6463,,FRONT EARTH SC-SWITZ,Front.

The main symptom of autism in children is the presence of a social barrier, and one of the main reasons for that is a lack of emotional cognitive ability. However, the existing autism-treatment systems intended for children pay little attention to the emotion cognition disorder. Besides, too much importance has been given to the interaction with children, while limiting the timeliness and movability of these systems. With the aim to address this shortcoming, in this work, we focus on the emotion cognition disorder and design a feasible solution for enhancing perception and expression ability of children with ASD. First, the first-view emotional care system for children with ASD (First-ECS) is developed using a wearable robot as a system carrier and realizing the deep emotional interaction with children with autism from the first-view perspective. Emotion communication is used to meet high timeliness requirements for emotion transmission in the First-ECS. Next, the emotional interaction mechanism that is applicable to the line of sight and non-line of sight communication scenarios is introduced. Also, the emotion perception engine and emotion expression engine are designed. Subsequently, multimodal data collection and processing by a wearable affective robot are discussed.

Taking Guizhou, China as an example, which includes both karst (including five different landforms) and non-karst area, the study explored and compared the tradeoff and synergy between ecosystem services in both terrain types. The results showed higher change rates of water yield and soil retention in karst areas than those in non-karst areas, with only small differences in the carbon storage and crop production change. The ecosystem service relationships in the karst area from 1995 to 2005 were consistent with the relationships in the non-karst area. However, differences were observed in most of these relationships from 2005 to 2015. The relationships between ecosystem services in different karst landforms from 1995 to 2005 remained the same, but there are differences found in the relationships of ecosystem services from 2005 to 2015. The trade-off and synergistic relationships between ecosystem services in the different landforms were closely related to the changes of climate and land use, particularly related to rainfall, rainfall erosivity, farmland, and forestland.","[Han, Hui-qing; Liu, Yue; Zhang, Ying-jia; Wang, Zhe; Chen, Xiao-qiao] Guizhou Inst Technol, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Guiyang 550003, Peoples R China; [Gao, Hong-juan] Guizhou Educ Univ, Sch Geog & Resources, Guiyang 550018, Peoples R China",Guizhou Institute of Technology; Guizhou Education University,"Han, HQ (corresponding author), Guizhou Inst Technol, Coll Architecture & Urban Planning, Guiyang 550003, Peoples R China.",hhuiqing2006@126.com; 842004849@qq.com; cgp1963@126.com; kuailebaby2004@126.com; kuailebaby2006@126.com; 290857583@qq.com,,"Han, Huiqing/0000-0001-5243-0027",,,,,72,15,17,27,127,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1672-6316,1993-0321,,J MT SCI-ENGL,J Mt.

The magnitude of carrying capacity of resources and environment is the result of the balance of multiple aspects including economy, resources, and society. In order to reflect this multi-dimensional vector relationship, a multi-level and multi-targeted evaluation index system needs to be constructed. The paper, adopting the analytic hierarchy process and including PM2.5 (Particulate matter with diameter less than or equal to 2.5 microns in the atmosphere) into the index system, establishes the evaluation system of regional RECC and analyzes the trend of RECC in Hefei city with the index system to put forward the countermeasures of forewarning management. The results are shown as follows: (1) Overall, the RECC in Hefei city presents a declining trend, with a reduction from a middle to lower level during the year 2009 to 2013, of which the year 2010 to 2011 showed the fastest decline and the year 2013 witnessed a slight increase; (2) from the perspective of mutual influence of indexes, the main reason causing the decline of RECC in Hefei city is that the natural resources and environment carrying capacity was in a declining trend from the year 2009 to 2013, respectively declining from middle and high levels to a lower level, while the social economy carrying capacity in Hefei city was in an increasing trend as a whole from the year 2009 to 2013, with an increase from lower level to middle level. From the perspective of the forewarning management of RECC, it focuses on improving the forewarning response system of regional resources and environment carrying capacity, establishes the sharing mechanism of RECC monitoring data and improves the responsibility assigning mechanism of RECC. The study enriches the evaluation index system of RECC and proves that it is reasonable and efficient to build a differentiated index system to scientifically recognize RECC in different regions, having reference value to evaluate similar regional RECC.","[Zhang, Guiyou; Luo, Shuai; Wei, Shuo] Anhui Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China; [Jing, Zhuowei; Ma, Youhua] Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Resources & Environm, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China",Anhui Agricultural University; Anhui Agricultural University,"Ma, YH (corresponding author), Anhui Agr Univ, Sch Resources & Environm, Hefei 230036, Peoples R China.",guiyou387@163.com; sx11273611@sina.com; njyy038@njucm.edu.cn; highpla@163.com; yhma@ahau.edu.cn,,"MA, Youhua/0000-0002-6298-4725",National Social Science Fund of China [18BJY145],National Social Science Fund of China,The research was sponsored by the National Social Science Fund of China (Project No.: 18BJY145).,,56,15,15,4,37,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB 2,2020,12,4,,,,,,,1637,10.3390/su12041637,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12041637,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KY3GT,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000522460200355,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the GPS trajectory data of taxis, this paper calculates and analyzes the operation efficiency of taxis in terms of time and space dimensions in Chengdu, Sichuan Province by using the capacity utilization rate. The results show that, firstly, the weekly variation trend of taxi capacity utilization rate is obviously periodic and its daily variation trend is unbalanced, which is reflected in the morning peak, afternoon peak, evening peak and night peak. The daily variation trend of taxi capacity utilization rate is significantly different between workdays and weekends, and the capacity utilization rate on weekends is much lower. Secondly, there is a spatial imbalance in the distribution of taxi capacity utilization rate. The capacity utilization rate of the main urban district is relatively high, and that of the other urban districts negatively correlates with the economic level and population density. The supply and demand of taxis are balanced within the various functional zones but unbalanced between different functional zones. It is suggested that the relevant departments shall reasonably allocate taxi resources according to the imbalance of taxi capacity utilization rate in time and space to improve the overall operation efficiency, and integrate market mechanism with government regulations to promote the sustainable development of urban taxis.

Therefore, in this paper, an entirely new method for evaluating aging properties of silicon rubber for composite insulators based on microscopic images was proposed. The microscopic images were collected by portable digital microscope-B011, and defective area proportion (k) was extracted by calculating and comparing the defective area pixel with the background pixel. Thus, the salt fog flashover experiments were conducted in a multifunction artificial climate chamber to indicate aging properties of silicon rubber material; then, the equations for calculating silicone rubber flashover voltage (U-50) by k were established. The value of U-50 can even decrease by 57.3% with the increase in the value of k. Moreover, a complete aging evaluation procedure of silicone rubber composite insulators was obtained. Taking a city as an example, the critical failure k (k1 = 19.6) value of composite insulators in the area was obtained.

It explains and shows how different measures such as shareholder value, economic value added (EVA), return on capital employed (ROCE), return on equity (ROE) and others are calculated and how they correlate to show long-term value added and, therefore, competitive differentiation. As part of the highly professionalized corporate governance approach, the German Corporate Governance Codex (Regierungskommision Deutscher Corporate Governance Kodex, 2015) asks for sustainable creation of value. The analyses of 2015 and 2016 annual reports of all 30 corporations state that 80% of the firms show financially relevant value added data and as such measurable competitive advantage on the long run. The paper focuses on which measures are used to quantify the competitive value addition and then shows how EVA or company specific EVA-like measures in addition to ROCE are the most used ones. Furthermore, the paper shows that ROCE with a factor of 0.97 in 2015 and 0.74 in 2016 correlates best with EVA and, in absence of an EVA calculation, is the best measure to represent value creation as a competitive differentiator.

SEs operate under cross-organizational and cross-departmental models. For years, the rapid economic development of Taiwan has focused on the pursuit of profit without focusing on the development of NPOs. Only after the economy began to slow down did society gradually see a new trend based on the concept of SEs and the cultivation of community self-sufficiency to solve social problems. Its successful implementation is of great significance to the sustainable development of Taiwan. Community industry is based on the community and it is people-oriented. From the perspective of sustainable development, community industry is invested in economic activities and creates multiple benefits to a sustainable community and to social, environmental, cultural, financial, and other developments. From the early production and welfare construction to the new hometown overall construction policy, Taiwan has placed emphasis on inherent local industry activation, such as the establishment of local industrial exchange centers, local industry sustainable mechanism construction, local characteristic small community enterprises, as well as economic plans, including Sustainable Employment Hope Project and Diverse Employment Development Program, promoted by the Labor Commission since 2001. All of these are focused on building and developing a community industry, and relevant authorities look forward to the vitality of the community industry to create more job opportunities and community interests. Based on literature review of social enterprise, this paper leads small- and medium-sized community industries to meet the development of business models from the economic perspective of commercialization and the social perspective of social innovation in order to solve the quality crisis that is faced by nonprofit organizations and to maintain the sustainable development of the enterprise. By the design of a nonprofit and mutual-assistance mechanism, poverty relief results can be obtained. SEs, which are similar to regular enterprises, can encounter challenging business environments and they must also possess the ability to assume business risks. Specifically, SEs must consider the dual goals of having a social mission while achieving economic goals. This study provides a detailed understanding of the existence and operational characteristics of SEs in Taiwan.","[Wu, Yung Chang; Wu, Shiann Ming] Natl Huaqiao Univ, Coll Business Adm, Quanzhou 362021, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yenchun Jim] Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Grad Inst Global Business & Strategy, Taipei 10645, Taiwan",Huaqiao University; National Taiwan Normal University,"Wu, YJ (corresponding author), Natl Taiwan Normal Univ, Grad Inst Global Business & Strategy, Taipei 10645, Taiwan.",Jasonwu988@gmail.com; wuyenchun@gmail.com; wuming@cute.edu.tw,"Zampier, Marcia/GYI-9204-2022; Wu, Yenchun Jim/F-6648-2010; 吳, 書平/GXG-9770-2022; Wu, Yenchun Jim/GQO-8578-2022","Wu, Yenchun Jim/0000-0001-5479-2873; Wu, Yenchun Jim/0000-0001-5479-2873","Ministry of Science & Technology, Taiwan [MOST 104-2511-S-003-031-MY3, MOST 106-2511-S-003-029-MY3]","Ministry of Science & Technology, Taiwan","This manuscript was partially supported by Ministry of Science & Technology, Taiwan (MOST 104-2511-S-003-031-MY3 & MOST 106-2511-S-003-029-MY3).",,49,15,15,3,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,JUN,2018,10,6,,,,,,,1797,10.3390/su10061797,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10061797,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GK9LE,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000436570100109,View Full Record in Web of Science

The main contribution of this paper is providing a new evaluation method for urban water saving. First, an urban water-saving evaluation index system is built. And the index system takes six water-saving standards including comprehensive water saving, domestic water saving, ecological water saving, industrial water saving, agricultural water saving and social economy as criteria. Then, the water-saving assessment model is proposed based on the Multi-grade Uncertain Comprehensive Evaluation (MUCE) Method. In this method, the important degree and the corresponding remark of each evaluation index are both considered to be uncertain variables due to the human uncertainty. The weights as well as the final evaluation result are obtained according to their uncertainty distributions and the votes of experts.

The optimal allocation of multi-water resources is valuable for agricultural water management in arid and semi-arid regions. However, traditional deterministic programming does not solve the complex water resources allocation in irrigation systems. Furthermore, previous allocation methods of irrigation water seldom considered the water cycle process, especially for multi-sources of irrigation. In this study, we develop an inexact fuzzy stochastic simulation-optimization programming (IFSSOP) model for the irrigation water optimal allocation of two water sources. The model combines the crop water model and the field water cycle model with an uncertainty optimization model, which considers the contribution of groundwater to crop water consumption. As a case study, the developed model is used in an arid area with two irrigation water sources: a river and a lake. Accordingly, the total optimal allocation irrigation water amounts of river and lake water under different violation probabilities in various hydrological years were obtained. By comparing the IFSSOP model with the IFSSOP model without considering the contribution of shallow groundwater (IFSSOP-NG model), it can be shown that the system benefits of the developed model are higher. With the lake water source from flood water, the region can save 30-34% of the river water, maintaining the original crop water deficit irrigation ratio. Consequently, application of the IFSSOP model in irrigation scheduling will provide effective water allocation patterns to save more water in an arid region with shallow groundwater.","[Li, Xuemin; Huo, Zailin] China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xu, Bing] Minist Water Resources China, Inst Water Resources Pastoral Area, Hohhot 010018, Peoples R China",China Agricultural University,"Huo, ZL (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Ctr Agr Water Res China, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",lixuemin@cau.edu.cn; huozl@cau.edu.cn; nmxubing@163.com,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFC0403301]; National Natural Science Fund of China [51639009, 51679236]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Fund of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC0403301) and National Natural Science Fund of China (51639009, 51679236).

According to the electricity transmission and distribution tariff accounting mechanism of costs and benefits, the power grid investment needs to be recycled by the transmission and distribution tariff. However, at present, the low electricity transmission and distribution tariff in China, which is based on the difference between the electricity sales price and the average purchase price, cannot guarantee the return of investment and the sustainable development of the power grid. Based on the current situation of China's power grid construction and electricity transmission and distribution tariff, this paper proposes that the new investments in the power grid can be divided into technical innovation investments, environmentally friendly investments, service promotion investments and other kinds of investments, according to their functions. Then, four electricity transmission and distribution tariff and power grid investment linkage models are built and example analysis undertaken, respectively, which are the timely linkage model, static linkage model, ladder linkage model, in which the electricity tariff space changes by a fixed absolute value annually and ladder linkage model in which the electricity tariff space changes by a fixed proportion value annually. The results reveal that the ladder linkage model in which the electricity tariff space changes by a fixed absolute value annually can guarantee relatively smooth changes in the electricity tariff, and is suitable for the actual situation of China's power market. The transmission and distribution electricity tariff and power grid investment linkage models based on sustainable development built in this paper are beneficial for promoting the reforms of the electricity transmission and distribution tariff in China and guiding the establishment of a scientific electricity tariff mechanism.

Design/methodology/approach - Based on a sample carried out between small cooperatives and worker-owned companies which are the most representative legal forms in the Spanish social economy collective the authors develop an empirical study using a logistic regression model. Findings - The results show that, on the whole, innovation in these kinds of firm seems to be determined by the same set of variables as in the case of traditional firms. In addition to this, the present research reveals that the influence of these variables on entrepreneurial innovations depends on the kind of innovation. Finally, the findings also give evidence about the existence of an inter-dependence among the different types of innovation in social economy firms. Research limitations/implications - The study is limited to small firms within the Spanish industrial and service sectors, but provides future researchers with further replication opportunities. Originality/value - Taking into account the relevant contribution of social economy companies to the Spanish economy, and having noted the scarce number of studies about innovation in the social economy sector, this research offers a significant contribution by specifying the innovative behavior of social economy firms in Spain.","[Jose Rodriguez, M.] Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ 1, Seville, Spain; [Guzman, Carmen] Univ Huelva, Dept Econ, Huelva, Spain",University of Sevilla; Universidad de Huelva,"Rodríguez, MJ (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Appl Econ 1, Seville, Spain.",mjrodri@us.es,"Rodríguez-Gutiérrez, María José/B-8980-2014; Guzman, Carmen/I-8025-2018","Rodríguez-Gutiérrez, María José/0000-0002-2756-8662; Guzman, Carmen/0000-0002-5290-8841",,,,,46,15,18,0,57,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0025-1747,1758-6070,,MANAGE DECIS,Manag.

A comprehensive analysis and understanding of the land use changes and ecosystem services, and the equilibrium state of the interaction between the natural environment and the social economy is crucial for the sustainable utilization of land resources. We used remote sensing image to research the LUCC, ecosystem service value (ESV), and ecological economic harmony (EEH) in eight main urban areas of Harbin in China from 1990 to 2015. The results show that, in the past 25 years, arable land-which is a part of ecological land-is the main source of construction land for urbanization, whereas the other ecological land is the main source of conversion to arable land. There is no significant change in the value ratio of ESV, however, it is also inclined to the southeast of the study area in spaces like the barycenter of LUCC. The EEH degree has risen from the potential crisis area to the medium coordination degree, and then dropped to the low coordination degree. This shows that although there has been limited change of LUCC, ESV, and EEH in eight main urban areas of Harbin in 25 years, there is a contradiction between the allocation of ecological land and non-ecological land.","[Riao, Dao; Zhu, Xiaomeng; Tong, Zhijun; Zhang, Jiquan; Wang, Aoyang] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Riao, Dao; Tong, Zhijun; Zhang, Jiquan; Wang, Aoyang] Northeast Normal Univ, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Veg, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Riao, Dao; Tong, Zhijun; Zhang, Jiquan; Wang, Aoyang] Minist Educ, Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xiaomeng] Shanghai An Shan Expt Jr High Sch, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China,"Tong, ZJ; Zhang, JQ (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.;Tong, ZJ; Zhang, JQ (corresponding author), Northeast Normal Univ, State Environm Protect Key Lab Wetland Ecol & Veg, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.;Tong, ZJ; Zhang, JQ (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Lab Vegetat Ecol, Changchun 130024, Peoples R China.",daora388@nenu.edu.cn; zhuxm712@nenu.edu.cn; gis@nenu.edu.cn; zhangjq022@nenu.edu.cn; wangay950@nenu.edu.cn,,"Wang, Yongfang/0000-0001-6077-8429","Key Scientific and Technology Program of Jilin Province, (China) [20170204035SF]; Science and Technology Development Planning of Jilin Province, (China) [20190303081SF]","Key Scientific and Technology Program of Jilin Province, (China); Science and Technology Development Planning of Jilin Province, (China)","This research was funded by the Key Scientific and Technology Program of Jilin Province, (China) (20170204035SF); the Science and Technology Development Planning of Jilin Province, (China) (20190303081SF).",,51,14,14,4,68,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,AUG,2020,12,15,,,,,,,6076,10.3390/su12156076,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12156076,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MZ6IE,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000559228700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It analyzes the predominant leadership styles and gender differences in cooperatives with a sample of 114 cooperative firms. The results show that: (a) Both transformational and transactional leadership styles are widely used; (b) no significant differences in leadership styles between men and women exist; and (c) the composition of management teams results in significant leadership style differences. The transformational style is less often used in mixed teams with a male majority and a woman president, and most often used in homogeneous teams (made up of only men or only women). Transactional leadership is more frequently implemented in teams made up only of women than in mixed masculine teams with a female president.

In this study, we explored the characteristics of the ecosystem and environment of watershed by analyzing and modeling the relationships among socio-economic indices, heavy metal elements and landscape metrics. Landsat 8 data were used to generate a land cover classification map and to derive landscape pattern indices. Governmental finance statistics yearbook data were referred to provide socio-economic indices. Moreover, 9 samples were collected from the upstream to the downstream to obtain the values of heavy metal concentrations in the water body. Then, both correlation and regression analyses were applied to analyze and model the relationships among these indices. The results of this study showed that 1) The ecological status and process (social economy, land cover, water and soil pollution) of this river watershed could be explained by analyzing the relationships among the socio-economic indices, heavy metal elements and landscape pattern indices selected based on correlation analysis; 2) The accumulated socio-economic indices were significantly correlated with Al, Fe and Ni and should be applied to the integrated assessment of the watershed ecological environment; 3) Cu, Zn and Pb were the main elements that showed significant correlations with the forest land; 4) Some landscape patterns indices such as Total Area (TA) and Effective Mesh Size (MESH) could be used to the integrated assessment of the watershed characteristics because of their strong correlations with the area (or area percentage) of important landscape types; and 5) transportation land had a close relationship with per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This study implied that analyzing and modeling the relationships among the socio-economic indices, heavy metal elements and landscape pattern indices can provide a powerful tool for characterizing the ecosystem of the river watershed and useful guidelines for the watershed management and sustainable development.","[Yu, Huan; He, Zheng-Wei] Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China; [Kong, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Mt Hazards & Environm, Chengdu 610041, Peoples R China; [Wang, Guangxing; Wang, Qing] Southern Illinois Univ, Dept Geog & Environm Resources, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA","Chengdu University of Technology; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Mountain Hazards & Environment, CAS; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University","Yu, H (corresponding author), Chengdu Univ Technol, Coll Earth Sci, Chengdu 610059, Peoples R China.",yuhuan0622@126.com,"yu, huan/ITT-7452-2023","Wang, Qing/0000-0003-1364-0034","National Natural Science Funds of China [41971226, 41871357]; Sichuan Basic Science and Technology Project [18YYJC1148]; Branch of Mountain Sciences, Kathmandu Center for Research and Education, CAS-TU, Chengdu, China [Y8R3310310]; Hundred Young Talents Program of the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment [SDSQB-2015-02]; One-Three-Five Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [SDS-135-1708]; Science and Technology Service Network Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y8R2020022]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19030303]","National Natural Science Funds of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Sichuan Basic Science and Technology Project; Branch of Mountain Sciences, Kathmandu Center for Research and Education, CAS-TU, Chengdu, China; Hundred Young Talents Program of the Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment; One-Three-Five Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences; Science and Technology Service Network Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences)","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Funds of China (grant no. 41971226; 41871357), the Sichuan Basic Science and Technology Project (grant no. 18YYJC1148), the Branch of Mountain Sciences, Kathmandu Center for Research and Education, CAS-TU, Chengdu, China (grant no.

In this context, governments and institutions can moderate or accelerate this path, with the implementation of a series of policies to promote and drive the social economy. In Spain, responsibility for the design and implementation of such policies is transferred to sub-central governments, known as autonomous communities. Galicia is the first Spanish autonomous community to have its own Act on SE. This article explains the promotion strategy established in this region, which has resulted in an ecosystem favorable to the development and consolidation of the Galician SE, based on a combination of public policies with synergistic effects.

Evaluation of water resource value is a crucial issue for innovative management in regional water resources. In this paper, in consideration of the complexity and uncertainty of water resources, 15 indicators were selected to establish the assessment system for its value in Wuhan City from the following three aspects, namely the environment, resources, and society. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Entropy Weight Method were combined to calculate the comprehensive weight. An improved set pair analysis (SPA) model was applied to evaluate water resource assets in the period of 2013-2017. For the sake of the dependability of these results, the James Pollution Loss model was utilized to compute loss of water resource value caused by the decline of water quality in the water pollution environment. The results show that the amount of water resource through physical quantitative accounting in Wuhan City fluctuates greatly. The initial change is relatively stable, then surges in 2015 and 2016, but slumps in 2017. The total water resource assets for Wuhan City from 2013 to 2017 are 14.221, 14.833, 28.375, 75.558, and 21.315 billion RMB, respectively. Therefore, water resource value accounting plays an indispensable role in the environmental protection and sustainable development of water, as well as provides a support for comprehensive calculation and management of various valuable natural resources.","[Zhang, Jingdong; Li, Yanan; Liu, Chaoyang; Qu, Zhiguang; Li, Fei; Yang, Zhaofei; Jiang, Luping; Fu, Jiatian] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Res Ctr Environm & Hlth, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jingdong; Li, Yanan; Liu, Chaoyang; Qu, Zhiguang; Li, Fei; Yang, Zhaofei; Jiang, Luping; Fu, Jiatian] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Informat & Safety Engn, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Zhongnan University of Economics & Law,"Liu, CY (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Res Ctr Environm & Hlth, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Liu, CY (corresponding author), Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Informat & Safety Engn, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China.",lcy@zuel.edu.cn,"Zhang, Jing/GWZ-7332-2022; Jiang, Yalin/ITV-2565-2023; Shi, Z/ISB-4324-2023; LIU, YU/HTR-1607-2023; Li, Yanan/ABL-1507-2022; zhang, luyu/JJC-4227-2023; Li, Fei/I-8918-2019","Jiang, Yalin/0009-0003-3726-8828; Li, Yanan/0000-0002-6321-2567; Li, Fei/0000-0003-4791-3264","National Natural Science Foundation of China [51,578,222, 61,602,518, 71,503,268]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [17YJCZH081]; Social Science Foundation of Hubei Province [2017161]; Hubei special technology innovation (Soft Science Research) [2018ADC074, 2018ADC144]; Social Science Foundation of Hubei Education Department [17Z017]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Social Science Foundation of Hubei Province; Hubei special technology innovation (Soft Science Research); Social Science Foundation of Hubei Education Department","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51,578,222, 61,602,518 and 71,503,268), Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (17YJCZH081), Social Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2017161), Hubei special technology innovation (Soft Science Research) (2018ADC074, 2018ADC144), and Social Science Foundation of Hubei Education Department (17Z017).",,82,14,14,9,70,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,AUG,2019,11,8,,,,,,,1718,10.3390/w11081718,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11081718,,,16,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IV9CM,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000484561500191,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, if such entities want to survive and thrive in the new international context, they cannot ignore their inefficiencies in both the financial and social dimensions of their activity. However, previous research on efficiency in credit cooperatives is very limited and only considers their financial activity. To date, no study has been published giving evidence through indicators on whether these banking institutions are socially efficient. This paper therefore constructs a social efficiency index of Spanish credit cooperatives during the period 2008-2014 and examines its main explanatory factors. After applying a two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis approach, the results from the first stage indicate that, on average, the social efficiency of Spanish credit cooperatives reaches an acceptable level of 66.42 %. Second-stage truncated regression reveals that entities with a greater proportion of branches in urban areas are socially less efficient, whereas both their size and the number of service points have a positive effect. Interestingly, social efficiency also varies significantly depending on the regional location of credit cooperatives in Spain. As a result, our findings enable these Social Economy financial institutions to both know their performance relative to their social activity and use this information to improve their competitiveness in the future.","[Martinez-Campillo, Almudena; Fernandez-Santos, Yolanda] Univ Leon, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Campus Vegazana S-N, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Martínez-Campillo, A (corresponding author), Univ Leon, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Campus Vegazana S-N, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",amarc@unileon.es; yfers@unileon.es,"Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/G-8575-2015; Fernández-Santos, Yolanda/L-8070-2016","Fernandez-Santos, Yolanda/0000-0003-1392-3130; Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/0000-0002-3313-529X",,,,,65,14,15,1,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0303-8300,1573-0921,,SOC INDIC RES,Soc.

Taking Jiangxi Province as the study area, this study first explored the driving mechanism of the natural environment and social economy on deforestation and afforestation using a simultaneous equation model. The results indicate that population size, topographic and geomorphologic factors, climate, and location play leading roles in influencing forestland density fluctuations. Specifically, the population size, economic development level, gross value of forestry production, climate conditions, and government policies are key influencing factors of afforestation. Deforestation is mainly influenced by agricultural population, non-agricultural economy, forestry production, forestry density, location, transportation, and climate. In addition, this study simulated the spatial distribution of land use and analyzed the spatial characteristics and variation trends of forestland area and quality under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) climate scenarios from 2010 to 2030 using the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects (CLUE) model. The results indicate that forestland declines under the Asia-Pacific integrated model (AIM) climate scenario. The environment tends to be heavily damaged under this kind of scenarios, and measures should be taken in order to protect the environment. Although the model for energy supply strategy alternatives and their general environmental impact (MESSAGE) scenario is to some extent better than the AIM scenario, destruction of the environment will still occur, and it is necessary to restrain deforestation and convert shrub land into forestland or garden land.

This study, following earlier research in Canada that found that credit unions are more prevalent in rural communities and small towns relative to the general population and to banks, examines credit union and bank branches in three U.S. states (Arizona, New Hampshire, and Wisconsin). We find that credit union branches are strongly represented in sizable urban communities, and are more likely to be located in low-income zip code areas than banks. The data show not only evidence of a credit union niche market but also a tension between social and economic objectives, and that credit unions accommodate themselves to profit norms, what we refer to as market accommodation.","[Mook, Laurie] Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, Nonprofit Leadership & Management Program, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA; [Maiorano, John; Quarter, Jack] Univ Toronto, Dept Leadership Higher & Adult Educ, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Quarter, Jack] Univ Toronto, Social Econ Ctr, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Downtown Phoenix; University of Toronto; University of Toronto,"Mook, L (corresponding author), Arizona State Univ, Sch Community Resources & Dev, 411 N Cent Ave,Suite 550, Phoenix, AZ 85004 USA.",lmook@asu.edu,"Mook, Laurie/AAH-9966-2019; Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022; Mook, Laurie/C-6045-2014","Mook, Laurie/0000-0001-5831-6866",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [833-2009-1000],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [grant number 833-2009-1000].",,29,14,18,2,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0899-7640,1552-7395,,NONPROF VOLUNT SEC Q,Nonprofit Volunt.

Matriliny mattered in Kala, I argue, because it motivated repatriation, generating witchcraft accusations stemming from variations of the matrilineal puzzle. On the surface, Kala did not 'look' particularly matrilineal, given the ad hoc domestic arrangements of surviving refugees. But when placed against the backdrop of matrilineal descent - expressed in broader kinship networks between refugee households, and as an evaluative discourse of illegitimate accumulation - witchcraft-driven repatriation makes sense as an 'extreme' form of lineage fission. Within the confines of the refugee camp, a Central African model of matriliny was effectively reduced to its core dynamics, highlighting a bio-social economy of the womb and its witchcraft conversions of blood into money. After examining three social dramas of witchcraft and repatriation in Kala, I engage broader considerations of gender and history to recast descent as a regenerative scheme.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Apter, A (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",aapter@history.ucla.edu,,,,,,,56,14,21,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1359-0987,,,J ROY ANTHROPOL INST,J.

These lead us to develop a specifically Italian model. Fair Trade in Italy is younger than its more established North European counterparts and more focussed on broad social justice issues in addition to its concern to include marginalized producers. This normative difference has given rise to a social-economy-dominated value chain (with a partial corporate involvement uniquely in the retail sphere), although it has generated much lower per capita consumption of Fair Trade products. At the same time, we also observe a relatively higher specialization in handicraft products and educational activities as well as a strong capacity to attract voluntary labour and create social capital. We identify clear trade-offs between social goals and the economic performance of the Italian model: reduced economies of scale, a closer focus on non-economic-value-creating social activities and greater consideration of values such as consumption sobriety and environmental concerns which may conflict with economic performance. We propose solutions which may resolve these dilemmas without abandoning the initial ambition not only to achieve the promotion of market access for marginalized producers in the South, but also to pursue a broader concept of wellbeing in the North and the South.","[Becchetti, Leonardo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ & Ist, Rome, Italy; [Costantino, Marco] Univ Bari, Dipartimento Studi Geog & Merceolog, Fac Econ, Bari, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Becchetti, L (corresponding author), Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Dipartimento Econ & Ist, Rome, Italy.",Becchetti@economia.uniroma2.it,,"BECCHETTI, LEONARDO/0000-0002-7629-0716",,,,,47,14,14,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

The objectives of this study were to develop a method to integrate ecological and socioeconomic networks to make the currently independent research on ecology and social economy more cohesive and measure the sustainable development of wetland resources and economy. In this study, we constructed a nitrogen metabolism network model to connect the two networks using certain nodes as interfaces by material transfer, resource utilization or public environment. We used ecological network analysis to examine nitrogen flows and relationships over two decades, i.e., from 1995 to 2015. A total of 26 nodes connected 135-136 direct and 676 integral paths in the integrated metabolic network. The results showed that Dongying city was in a state of nitrogen accumulation, and nitrogen sequestration increased in the atmosphere and decreased in coastal wetlands. Three key paths of nitrogen flow growth and 12 stable key paths were identified. Key nodes with a higher influence on the specific node were observed based on the integral flow. Stable competition relationships mainly existed within wetland resources, and intricate exploitation relationships existed in the socioeconomic system and between wetland resources and socioeconomic nodes. The findings of this work indicate that nitrogen metabolism is suitable for accurately identifying the key nodes, paths and influences from human activities, and ecological relationships of an integrated network, which can provide a reference for wetland restoration, industrial restructuring and urban sustainability.","[Zhi, Liehui; Li, Xiaowen; Bai, Junhong; Guan, Yanan] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Xinjiekouwai St 19, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Zhi, Liehui] Hebei Univ Engn, Taiji Rd 19, Handan 056038, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Hebei University of Engineering,"Li, XW; Bai, JH (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, State Key Lab Water Environm Simulat, Xinjiekouwai St 19, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",lixw@bnu.edu.cn; junhongbai@163.com,"Bai, Junhong/V-1993-2019; 枫, 岚露/JCP-2702-2023","Bai, Junhong/0000-0003-2613-2143; Zhi, Liehui/0000-0002-2119-0603",National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC0505906]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31770576],National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China(2017YFC0505906) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31770576).

When this resilience is lower than a certain critical threshold, the country or region will be in a fragile state. The comprehensive embodiment of ecological resilience, social resilience, and economic resilience of a country or region is regional resilience. Due to the wide range of countries along the Belt and Road, differences in natural background conditions and stages of economic and social development among different countries lead to different degrees of vulnerability, and the improvement of resilience is conducive to reducing vulnerability. At the same time, the research on the measurement and differentiation characteristics of regional resilience is of considerable significance to solve the weak foundation of environmental management and the lack of ability to deal with climate change of the Belt and Road countries. In this study, by using entropy weighting method and multi-index comprehensive evaluation method, 24 specific indicators are selected from three different dimensions: ecology, economy, and society, to construct a comprehensive evaluation index system about the Belt and Road countries resilience, and to evaluate the comprehensive resilience and spatial heterogeneity characteristics of China and 64 countries along the Belt and Road, and use multiple linear regression analysis to identify the main influencing factors of comprehensive resilience and analyze its influencing mechanism. According to the research, the overall resilience level of the Belt and Road countries shows prominent differentiation characteristics of extreme difference, the countries with low and low recovery status account for the vast majority; and the spatial differentiation characteristics of the levels of ecological resilience, economic resilience, and social resilience of countries along the Belt and Road are quite different. In countries with high levels of economic development, their comprehensive resilience is significantly higher than that of countries with low levels of economic development. There is no inevitable connection between a country's economic growth rate and its comprehensive resilience level. At the same time, the relationship between resource richness and comprehensive resilience of countries is not apparent, but for those countries that are over-dependent on resources, the level of resilience is generally below. There is a certain degree of correspondence between urbanization rate and comprehensive resilience, that is, the comprehensive resilience will increase with the increase of urbanization rate. When the urbanization rate rises to a certain level, the level of comprehensive resilience does not change much. In this study, it provides scientific guidance for enriching regional resilience and national sustainable development theory, solving the fragile ecological environment foundation of the Belt and Road countries, speeding up the transformation of economic growth mode and dealing with a series of social problems.","[Zhang, Shuai; Wang, Chengxin; Wang, Zhaohan] Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuai; Zhang, Fan; Wang, Zhaohan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Shuai; Wang, Chengxin; Wang, Zhaohan] Univ Shandong, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Human Nat & Green Dev, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China","Shandong Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Shandong University","Wang, CX (corresponding author), Shandong Normal Univ, Coll Geog & Environm, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Zhang, F (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Key Lab Land Surface Pattern & Simulat, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Wang, CX (corresponding author), Univ Shandong, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Human Nat & Green Dev, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",zhangf.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; 404122665@qq.com,"Fan, Zhang/AAZ-3509-2021","Zhang, Fan/0000-0003-3453-0512",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20010302],Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences),"This research was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [Grant Nos.

Recent research has suggested there is a positive association between cooperatives and women's entrepreneurial activity based on the assumption that this model is especially suitable for women's expectations and is favourable to their economic entrepreneurial development. However, few studies have empirically tested these propositions. This research, which analysed data from 264 Spanish cooperatives, confirms these findings. A mixed-methods approach was used. In the first stage, a Delphi study was run with 11 cooperative entrepreneurship experts to ask what factors may be decisive for women preferring a cooperative model. In the second stage, the factors derived from the Delphi study were used in a survey targeting female cooperative associates. The findings confirmed that female cooperative owners perceived this business model to be aligned with their values and best fit their work and lifestyle. This research contributes to the existing social entrepreneurship literature by providing empirical evidence from the Spanish context that highlights the role of women in cooperatives. The findings also emphasize the need for responsive policies and programmes that promote the cooperative model since it promotes female employment and women's entrepreneurial activity even in periods of economic austerity.","[Bastida, Maria; Olveira Blanco, Ana] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Business Adm & Commerce, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain; [Pinto, Luisa Helena] Univ Porto, Sch Econ, P-4200464 Porto, Portugal; [Cancelo, Maite] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Bastida, M (corresponding author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Business Adm & Commerce, Santiago De Compostela 15782, Spain.",maria.bastida@usc.es; lhpinto@fep.up.pt; anaolveira.blanco@usc.es; maite.cancelo@usc.es,"Pinto, Luisa/GXF-0087-2022; Cancelo, Maite/AAB-2019-2021; Pinto, Luisa Helena/B-4440-2016; Bastida, Maria/AAB-7449-2020; Blanco, Ana Olveira/AAJ-6946-2021","Pinto, Luisa Helena/0000-0001-8323-9313; Bastida, Maria/0000-0002-3630-5629; Blanco, Ana Olveira/0000-0002-7165-3354; Cancelo, Maite/0000-0002-8705-1833",Xunta de Galicia [TR811A-15-009-19],Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),"This research was funded by Xunta de Galicia, grant number TR811A-15-009-19.",,88,13,14,2,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR 2,2020,12,6,,,,,,,2478,10.3390/su12062478,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12062478,,,17,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,LA1YW,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000523751400325,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Yanchi County, a series of projects were implemented to combat desertification after 2000. To assess the effects of these Desertification Control Projects from the farmers' perspective, we divided Yanchi County into two regions (the northern and southern regions) according to their different environmental conditions. We collected data including basic family information, farmers' perceptions and attitudes, and farmers' suggestions, in a questionnaire investigation following the Participatory Rural Appraisal approach. Data analysis using the Mann-Whitney U test and Fisher's exact test revealed that the Desertification Control Projects were generally successful, as the local environment and farmers' incomes were both improved. Farmers were all satisfied with the effects of the projects, but the farmers in the southern region had a higher acceptance of the projects than those in the northern region. In addition, three problems with the Desertification Control Projects were noted: the farmers had a low degree of participation in the projects, the farmer's low incomes affected the sustainability of the projects, and the implementation of the complete grazing ban had several adverse effects. We provided suggestions for solving these problems. Our findings have important implications for assessing the effects of environmental conservation projects, especially from a participant's perspective.","[Wei, Xuan; Yang, Guojing; Wang, Ya; Chen, Yong] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Ecoenvironm & Resources, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Wei, Xuan; Zhou, Lihua] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Lihua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences","Zhou, LH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Zhou, LH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Sci & Dev, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China.",wei_liu_xuan@yeah.net; lhzhou@casisd.cn; ygj7518@163.com; wy_2018dream@yeah.net; chenyong@lzb.ac.cn,"Zhang, Lei/JPK-4307-2023; Zhou, Li/GSE-4531-2022; 周, 丽敏/JEO-3613-2023",,"National Key Research AMP; Development Program of China [2016YFC0500909, 2018YFA0606402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41671187, 41601587, 41807519]",National Key Research AMP; Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research was funded by the National Key Research & Development Program of China (2016YFC0500909; 2018YFA0606402) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41671187; no. 41601587; no. 41807519).,,43,13,13,2,32,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

This paper explains how social accounting can generate legitimacy for a social company and make companies more sustainable. The demand to know the value that different organizations generate or detract from society has increased since the global crisis of 2008. Sustainable organizations are those that positively impact all stakeholder groups. In this paper, an analysis of 20 Spanish social companies that have implemented or are going to implement social accounting is made. We analyzed, through interviews, the expectations and integration of social accounting, determining change-emerging factors occurring after the application of social accounting. For the qualitative analysis of the information collected, NVivo 12 was used, a software program adequate for qualitative and mixed-methods research. The main finding shows that most companies communicate results internally; thus, these companies expect a higher involvement in the implementation of social accounting. Social companies, since their value is fundamentally not centered on that which comes from commercial activity, need to evidence their effort on specific social values that do not go through the market, and so are not reflected in traditional financial statements.","[Lazkano, Larraitz; Beraza, Ana] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Financial Econ Dept 2, ECRI Res Grp, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Lazkano, L (corresponding author), Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Financial Econ Dept 2, ECRI Res Grp, Donostia San Sebastian 20018, Spain.",Larraitz.lazcano@ehu.eus; ana.beraza@ehu.eus,"LAZKANO, LARRAITZ/ABG-7323-2020; Beraza, Ana/H-5284-2013","LAZKANO, LARRAITZ/0000-0002-0506-5028; Beraza, Ana/0000-0002-5532-1800",University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) [US17_24],University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU),"This research was funded by the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Lantegi Batuak, and GEAccounting, grant number US17_24.",,30,13,13,1,22,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC 2,2019,11,24,,,,,,,6894,10.3390/su11246894,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11246894,,,12,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KC0SU,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000506899000011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on Beijing panel data for 1993-2012, an economic boom period in China, indirect carbon dioxide emissions were separately calculated for urban and rural households using the consumer lifestyle approach (CLA) model. Then, an extended stochastic impact by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model was used to analyze the influence from two aspects, social economy, and land use, with high precision. Results indicate that indirect CO2 emissions in Beijing households display a rising trend in urban areas but a slight decrease in rural areas. Technology influences and forest land are, respectively, the most important aspects of the social economy and land use. Higher population and urbanization resulted in enhanced emissions in both urban and rural areas. The Engel coefficient presented a negative correlation with indirect CO2 emissions for both rural and urban areas. Compared with urban areas, the per capita net income of rural areas restrained consumption. The consumption structure of urban residents was more biased toward the tertiary industry than that of rural residents. Although technical progress has proceeded, it cannot offset urban residents' indirect CO2 emissions caused by the large amount and rapid growth of consumption. Regarding land use, urban construction land net primary productivity (NPP) was high and not an important factor contributing to indirect CO2 emissions. Forest and lawn primarily served a recreational function and exhibited a positive impact. Water and cultivated land offered insufficient production and thus had a negative influence. For rural residents, lawn and cultivated land production is self-sufficient. Forests offer a carbon sequence effect, and construction land expansion increased the proportion of developed area, offering a scale effect that resulted in reduced carbon emissions. Based on the results, alternative carbon emission reduction policies have been proposed for each tested influence aspect to reduce emissions, including policies for optimizing industrialization quality, constructing a medium-density city, increasing space efficiency, encouraging sustainable consumption behavior, and increasing the efficiency of energy utilization.","[Jin, Xueting; Zhang, Jinzhou] Arizona State Univ, Sch Geog Sci & Urban Planning, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA; [Li, Yu; Sun, Dongqi; Zheng, Ji] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Li, Yu; Zheng, Ji] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resource & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Li, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Li, Y (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Coll Resource & Environm, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",xjin50@asu.edu; liy@igsnrr.ac.cn; sundq@igsnrr.ac.cn; jzhan300@asu.edu; zhengj.13s@igsnrr.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771182, 41501137]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, General Program [grant No. 41771182] and [grant No. 41501137].",,61,13,14,5,61,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,DEC,2019,11,23,,,,,,,6563,10.3390/su11236563,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11236563,,,21,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,KD9MV,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000508186400035,View Full Record in Web of Science

Priority cause areas for effective altruists include global poverty, existential risks to humanity, and animal welfare. Indeed, a significant subset of the movement argues that animal factory farming, in particular, is a problem of great scope, one that is overly neglected and offers the potential for massive reductions in global suffering. This paper explores the philosophical and methodological tenets of these effective animal advocates, offering empirical qualitative insight into their motivations and perspectives. The work also considers the implications of the effective altruists' entrance into the arena of animal advocacy, taking note of how various factions within both the effective altruist and animal protection movements have received their conceptual and practical interventions. The research highlights several potential contributions of the effective animal advocates, as their commitment to evaluate and amplify pragmatic solutions to the problems of animal suffering has the opportunity to shift institutional and consumer behaviors in ways the animal protection movement has struggled to do in the past. At the same time, key issues related to the community's research rigor and measurability biases, its lack of demographic diversity, and its tendency to valorize corporate-driven technological solutions open it up to criticism from internal and external detractors alike.","[Broad, Garrett M.] Fordham Univ, Dept Commun & Media Studies, Fac Mem Hall 432,441 East Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",Fordham University,"Broad, GM (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, Dept Commun & Media Studies, Fac Mem Hall 432,441 East Fordham Rd, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",gbroad@fordham.edu,,"Broad, Garrett/0000-0001-5217-1862",Fordham Faculty Research Grant,Fordham Faculty Research Grant,This research was partially funded by a Fordham Faculty Research Grant.

These problems will remain or even worsen in the following decades, threatening regional eco-environmental quality and socio-economic development. Mitigation of these problems through integrated water resources and farmland management (WRFM) is desired but is challenged by multiple system complexities, e.g. interrelations of diverse system components. To fill this gap, an interval fuzzy water resources and farmland programming (IFWRFP) approach is developed in this study for eliminating the potential problems in the SHRW, leading to increased reliability of the decision support process. A series of systematic WRFM measures are proposed for enabling harmonious development of ecological environment and social economy in the SHRW. For instance, planting should always be the priority due to the major contribution of agriculture to the regional economy. As the primary commercial crop, rice cultivation should be allocated the most irrigation water, followed by corn, potato and soybean. Potato yield should be increased to compensate for reduced productivity of the other crops since 2019. It is also revealed that economic benefits are proportional to water environmental pollution in the SHRW. Therefore, decision-makers should adopt the most reasonable suggested schemes after fully balancing the trade-off of environment and economy. Most importantly, a variety of supporting policies are required for enabling sufficient implementation of these measures across the SHRW. For instance, individual farmers can be encouraged to follow the overall crop cultivation plan by the alteration of subsidiaries, taxes, and prices on crop-related activities. The modeling solutions show that the IFWRFP approach can systematically optimize allocations of water resources and cultivation patterns and thus potentially eliminate the problems of water scarcity, water contamination, and soil erosion in the SHRW.","[Dong, Cong; Cheng, Guanhui] Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainable Communities, 3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Dong, Cong; Huang, Gordon; Cheng, Guanhui] UR BNU, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainabil Res, 3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Zhao, Shan] Shandong Univ, Sch Environm Sci & Engn, Shandong Key Lab Water Pollut Control & Resource, Qingdao 266237, Shandong, Peoples R China",University of Regina; Shandong University,"Cheng, GH (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainable Communities, 3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.;Huang, G; Cheng, GH (corresponding author), UR BNU, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainabil Res, 3737 Wascana Pkwy, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",huang@iseis.org; guanhuicheng@gmail.com,"Huang, Kai/JVO-5066-2024; Huang, Guohe/H-5306-2011; Huang, Guohe/AAA-7305-2019; Cheng, Guanhui/D-8826-2016","Huang, Guohe/0000-0003-4974-3019; Zhao, Shan/0000-0003-4538-4688; Cheng, Guanhui/0000-0002-6357-0719","National Key Research and Development Plan [2016YFC0502800, 2016YFA0601502]; Natural Sciences Foundation [51520105013, 51679087]; 111 Program [B14008]; Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada","National Key Research and Development Plan; Natural Sciences Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); 111 Program(Ministry of Education, China - 111 Project); Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC))","This research was supported by the National Key Research and Development Plan (2016YFC0502800, 2016YFA0601502), the Natural Sciences Foundation (51520105013, 51679087), the 111 Program (B14008) and the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",,50,13,13,4,69,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0920-4741,1573-1650,,WATER RESOUR MANAG,Water Resour.

In this paper, based on the principles of system dynamics, a sustainable water resources utilization model with coupled water quality and quantity is established using STELLA software to assess the sustainable use of water resources. The model includes two modules: a water supply module and a water quality module. The water supply module includes four sub-systems: economy, population, water supply, and water demand. The water quality module consists of an environmental sub-system. The model is suitable for Tianjin, where water resources are scarce. Calibration is performed using data from 2013-2016, and verification is performed using data from 2017. The simulation results are good. In order to compare the sustainable use of water resources in different development scenarios in Tianjin for 2025, a sensitivity analysis is performed for each variable, and four decision variables are selected to establish four water resources use scenarios (Scenarios 1-4). The results show that, compared with scenario 1, water shortages in scenarios 2 and 3 are delayed. Scenario 4, with stable economic growth and environmental consideration, can effectively resolve the contradiction between water supply and demand in the future, and is more conducive to the improvement of water quality. Finally, based on the above research, measures to solve water resources problems are proposed, in order to provide a reference for the sustainable use of water resources and optimization of water resources allocation in Tianjin.","[Tian, Yutong; Li, Chunhui; Yi, Yujun; Wang, Xuan; Shu, Anping] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Water & Sediment Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Li, CH; Shu, AP (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Environm, Minist Educ, Key Lab Water & Sediment Sci, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",18810550713@163.com; Chunhuili@bnu.edu.cn; yiyujun@bnu.edu.cn; wangx@bnu.edu.cn; Shuap@bnu.edu.cn,"wang, xuan/JBJ-6948-2023; Li, Ren/JVZ-9153-2024; wang, xuan/GXF-3679-2022","Li, Ren/0000-0002-2579-2580; Chunhui, Li/0000-0003-0067-4112","National Key Research and Development Program [2017YFC0404401, 2018YFC0407403]",National Key Research and Development Program,This study is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (2017YFC0404401 and 2018YFC0407403).,,31,12,12,8,71,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAY,2020,12,10,,,,,,,4254,10.3390/su12104254,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su12104254,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,MC6VG,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000543421400312,View Full Record in Web of Science

As the roadmap of urban traffic, the urban expressway has a relatively high and stable driving speed, and also bears a large amount of urban traffic. However, in recent years, with the expansion of the city scale, the congestion of urban expressways has become increasingly severe. In various areas of the merged area, due to various factors such as mismatched traffic capacity and reduced driving speed, it is easy to cause deterioration of road conditions in a short period of time and cause more secondary accidents. In order to reduce the incidence of expressway traffic accidents and to avoid as much as possible the casualties and property losses caused by accidents, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) supported by information technology, data communication transmission technology, control technology and traffic engineering were introduced. With the rise of artificial intelligence and the continuous development of ITS, the video acquisition methods of real-time traffic flow data and the image recognition ability of video sequences continue to improve, providing theoretical basis and technical support for the research of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition. Aiming at the shortcomings of traditional pattern recognition methods, such as weak anti-interference to complex traffic environment and low correct recognition rate, this paper studies the pattern recognition method based on image processing, and selects the fuzzy C-means clustering in the currently used clustering methods (FCM) algorithm Because the FCM algorithm cannot obtain the global optimal solution and need to determine the number of cluster categories in advance, this paper uses ReliefF algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to compare the feature weight and number of clusters of traditional FCM algorithm. Make improvements. Through the experimental analysis of the acquired video images, the results show that the improved FCM algorithm based on the proposed method has better real-time and accuracy in the application of urban expressway parallel pattern recognition.","[Liu, Zhendong; Jia, Hongfei] Jilin Univ, Sch Transportat, Changchun 130000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yanxia] Shandong Univ Technol, Sch Transportat & Vehicle Engn, Zibo 255000, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Shandong University of Technology,"Jia, HF (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Sch Transportat, Changchun 130000, Peoples R China.",liuzd17@mails.jlu.edu.cn; jiahf@jlu.edu.cn; wangyx200@163.com,"joy, shone/AAR-3728-2020",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51278221],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (51278221).",,27,12,13,8,36,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",0140-3664,1873-703X,,COMPUT COMMUN,Comput.

Two types of questionnaires were sent to organizations in Spain and Europe and 217 complete answers were received (152 from the public sector and 65 from the social entities). In addition, 20 semi-structured personal interviews were conducted by phone with managers of social enterprises and four interviews, also by phone, were carried out with relevant people from the public sector. The results of the surveys and the interviews were structured using the analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT), which was considered consistent with the strategic nature of public procurement. The perceived opportunities for the public sector focus on more efficient use of public resources and improvement of reputation and social equality. For the social entities, more participation in procurement could lead to less dependency on public funds and more visibility. The obstacles for the public sector are related to lack of training and internal resistance to change, as well as, in the case of social entities, to their small size and the tensions with their social object that might derive from bigger competition. The proposed activities focus on two objectives, more training to increase knowledge from the public sector and the readiness of social entities. It is concluded that it is necessary to establish channels of communications between the two groups to avoid possible inefficiencies.","[Mendoza Jimenez, Javier; Hernandez Lopez, Montserrat] Univ La Laguna, Fac Econ Business & Tourism, Dept Appl Econ & Quantitat Methods, Camino Hornera S-N, San Cristobal La Laguna 38200, Spain; [Mendoza Jimenez, Javier] Escuela Univ Iriarte, Paseo Santo Tomas S-N, Puerto La Cruz 38400, Santa Cruz De T, Spain; [Franco Escobar, Susana Eva] Univ La Laguna, Dept Basic Law Disciplines, Fac Law, Camino Hornera 37, San Cristobal La Laguna 38200, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna; Universidad de la Laguna,"Jimenez, JM (corresponding author), Univ La Laguna, Fac Econ Business & Tourism, Dept Appl Econ & Quantitat Methods, Camino Hornera S-N, San Cristobal La Laguna 38200, Spain.;Jimenez, JM (corresponding author), Escuela Univ Iriarte, Paseo Santo Tomas S-N, Puerto La Cruz 38400, Santa Cruz De T, Spain.",jmendozj@ull.edu.es; mhdezl@ull.edu.es; sefranco@ull.edu.es,"Hernández-López, Montserrat/AAC-2907-2020","Hernández-López, Montserrat/0000-0002-6743-7202; Mendoza Jimenez, Javier/0000-0002-7158-8724",UPV/EHU [US17_24],UPV/EHU,"This research was funded by the UPV/EHU, LantegiBatuak, and GEAccounting, grant number US17_24.",,34,12,12,4,15,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2019,11,22,,,,,,,6388,10.3390/su11226388,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11226388,,,23,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JW8DR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000503277900201,View Full Record in Web of Science

In order to characterize the dry/wet variations in the Poyang Lake basin during 1958-2013, based on the potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimated by the Thornthwaite (TH) and Penman-Monteith (PM) formulas, two types of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), namely SPEI_th and SPEI_pm, were calculated in this study. The characteristic of dry/wet variations in the Poyang Lake basin was analyzed and a comparative analysis of two SPEIs was conducted. The results indicate that both SPEI series showed a wet trend in the Poyang Lake basin on an annual scale as well as seasonal scales during 1958-2013, except for spring and autumn. A drying trend was observed in spring, while in autumn, the dry and wet conditions in two SPEIs had opposite trends. However, all trends from two SPEIs were not significant, except for summer SPEI_pm. Meanwhile, significant positive correlations were detected between precipitation and two SPEIs, with the correlation coefficients above 0.95, whereas negative correlations were detected between PET and two SPEIs, with the correlation coefficients ranging from -0.17 to -0.85. This indicates that precipitation was the main climatic factor to determine change in dry/wet conditions in the Poyang Lake basin. Although there were obvious differences between the accumulated values of the Penman-Monteith-based PET (ET_pm) and Thornthwaite-based PET (ET_th), trends in the SPEI_pm series were generally consistent with those in the SPEI_th series, revealing that the method for PET calculation was not critical to the change in dry/wet conditions. Moreover, the results of the conditional probability of SPEI_pm and SPEI_th show that both SPEI_pm and SPEI_th could detect wet or dry events that were identified by SPEI_pm or SPEI_th.","[Liu, Weilin; Liu, Lina] Nanchang Inst Technol, Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Wat, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Nanchang Institute Technology,"Liu, WL (corresponding author), Nanchang Inst Technol, Jiangxi Prov Key Lab Hydrol Water Resources & Wat, Nanchang 330099, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",weilin_liu@nit.edu.cn,,"liu, weilin/0000-0003-3726-1223",Science and Technology Research Program of Jiangxi Education Department [GJJ170980]; Superiority Science and Technology Innovation Team Construction Plan of Jiangxi Province [20171BCB24012]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51309130],Science and Technology Research Program of Jiangxi Education Department; Superiority Science and Technology Innovation Team Construction Plan of Jiangxi Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was financially supported by the Science and Technology Research Program of Jiangxi Education Department (GJJ170980), the Superiority Science and Technology Innovation Team Construction Plan of Jiangxi Province (20171BCB24012) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (51309130).",,57,12,13,9,49,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2073-4441,,WATER-SUI,Water,JUL,2019,11,7,,,,,,,1380,10.3390/w11071380,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w11071380,,,22,Environmental Sciences; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Water Resources,IQ3DW,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000480632300065,View Full Record in Web of Science

The purpose of this paper is to propose an assessment method to accurately reflect the sustainability of regional water resources in various areas. The method is based on the relative entropy of the information entropy theory. The steps are as follows. Firstly, the pretreatment of the evaluation sample data is required, before the relative entropy of each standard evaluation sample and evaluation grade (SEG) is calculated to obtain the entropy weight of each evaluation index. After this, the entropy weighted comprehensive index (WCI) of the standard evaluation grade sample is obtained. The function relation between WCI and SEG can be fitted by the cubic polynomial to construct the evaluation function. Using the above steps, a generalized entropy method (GEM) for the sustainable assessment of regional water resources is established and it is used to evaluate the sustainability of water resources in the Pingba and Huai River areas in China. The results show that the proposed GEM model can accurately reflect the sustainable water resources in the two regions. Compared with the other evaluation models, such as the Shepherd method, Artificial Neural Network and Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, the GEM model has larger differences in its evaluation results, which are more reasonable. Thus, the proposed GEM model can provide scientific data support for coordinating the relationship between the sustainable development and utilization of regional water resources in order to improve the development of regional population, society and economy.","[Zhang, Ming; Zhou, Jinghong; Zhou, Runjuan] Anhui Polytech Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China",Anhui Polytechnic University,"Zhang, M (corresponding author), Anhui Polytech Univ, Sch Civil Engn, Wuhu 241000, Peoples R China.",ahzhming@163.com; 2170430104@stu.ahpu.edu.cn; rjzhou@126.com,"Zhang, Ming/HZJ-8266-2023","Zhang, Ming/0000-0002-7384-3362",National Natural Science Foundation of China [51409001]; Excellent Talents Supporting program of Higher Education of Anhui [gxyqZD2016127]; Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation [1808085QE146],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Excellent Talents Supporting program of Higher Education of Anhui; Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province),"The authors would like to thank the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 51409001, Excellent Talents Supporting program of Higher Education of Anhui under Grant No. gxyqZD2016127 and Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation under Grant No. 1808085QE146.",,34,12,13,5,47,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1099-4300,,ENTROPY-SWITZ,Entropy,SEP,2018,20,9,,,,,,,715,10.3390/e20090715,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e20090715,,,12,"Physics, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Physics,GY1YI,33265804,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000448333000093,View Full Record in Web of Science

Of the various air pollutants, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which is less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, can cause serious health problems such as asthma, lung cancer, respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, birth defects, and premature death. The ability to have accurate dust information in real-life is very important for patients with respiratory illnesses. Visible-light communication, which performs the functions of illumination and data transmission in indoor environments, could be utilized for the long-term transmission of important environment information, even in places where RF transmissions are restricted, such as medical centers, emergency rooms, or nursing homes. In this paper, a prototype of a wavelength division multiplexing optical transmission system is proposed for electromagnetic interference-free indoor dust monitoring. Important indoor environment information, such as dust concentration, temperature, and relative humidity, are transferred by red green blue (RGB) light sources. A single RGB-type white light-emitting diode and a single color sensor are adopted to enable a low-complexity implementation. An average voltage-tracking technique is utilized for robust light detection to eliminate ambient light and low-frequency noise. The incoming RGB lights are separated by a color sensor, and are simultaneously processed by a receiver microcontroller. Medical experts and patients can then monitor indoor air quality in real-time, and they can improve the environmental awareness of individuals.","[An, Jinyoung] Pukyong Natl Univ, Team Next Generat U Healthcare Technol Dev, Busan 48513, South Korea; [Chung, Wan-Young] Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea",Pukyong National University; Pukyong National University,"Chung, WY (corresponding author), Pukyong Natl Univ, Dept Elect Engn, Busan 48513, South Korea.",wychung@pknu.ac.kr,,,"Mid-Career Researcher Program through an NRF Grant - MSIT, South Korea [2016R1A2B4015]; National Research Foundation of Korea [22A20130012635] Funding Source: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Information (KISTI), National Science & Technology Information Service (NTIS)","Mid-Career Researcher Program through an NRF Grant - MSIT, South Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","This work (2016R1A2B4015) was supported by Mid-Career Researcher Program through an NRF Grant funded by MSIT, South Korea.",,28,12,13,0,2,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2018,6,,,,,,74885,74894,,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2882576,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2882576,,,10,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,HF5NR,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000454279700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is argued that local agents based on their empirical knowledge for making ends meet create or enter local social networks treating them as paths of provisioning and as generators of tangible outcomes in the form of economic capital. These networks are mediated by a set of material transactions which in their turn are sustained and reproduced by the logic of generalized reciprocity as a form of exchange. We argue that local agents by taking advantage of the social economy framework, by producing goods and by using local social relations form a whole which is formed and reformed when they transact with each other in commodity production aiming at making their lives possible.

In different Brazilian states, the fibers removed from the young leaves (buds) of the Buriti palm tree are employed in handicraft manufacturing. These fibers are popularly called Buriti linen or silk. This paper presents the characteristics of the Buriti palm tree; its collection, processing, physicochemical properties, traditional and new employments. The employment of buriti fiber in traditional and new applications in design and industry is promising. Moreover, responsible and sustainable management of this natural resource can collaborate in the construction of social benefits.

In this paper, we analyze the effect of land use change on water balance in terms of the amount of water supply and demand from economic perspective. It's the first time to extend the basic 48 sectors input-output table to include water and land accounts that involved into multiple production processes for Zhangye city. We then perform the improved ORANI-G model, a single region Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, to analyze the effect of land use change on water balance under three scenarios. Subsequently, scenario-based simulation results are interpreted through selected sectors from agricultural, industrial, and service sectors respectively. Finally, the effect of land use change on.water balance is analyzed through the difference between business-as-usual and land use unchanged scenarios. the results show that the extent of effect on water balance is different among sectors. Specifically, from the perspective of absolute value, service sectors are the largest, followed by industrial sectors, and the agricultural sectors are the least. Conversely, in terms of percentage change of land use, the largest extent of effect occurs in agricultural sectors. Additionally, with the rapid urbanization and the development of social economy, water balance in industrial sectors and service sectors will be stricken and reconstructed to a new high level. Simulation results also show that agricultural land shrinking will mitigate water scarcity distinctly, which indicates that balance the relationship among different stakeholders is imperative to guarantee water transformation from agricultural sectors to industrial and service sectors.

In this study, distributed hydrologic model of SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was applied to the Kaidu River Basin, a watershed in the Tianshan Mountains and one of the headwaters of the Tarim River. To quantify the contribution of meteorological input to model output, a sensitivity analysis approach (SDP method, State-Dependent Parameter method) was applied before and after the model was calibrated. The sensitivity analysis shows that meteorological input contributes up to 64 % of model uncertainty due to scarcity of observed meteorological data especially in the alpine region, and the groundwater flow is the most important hydrologic process in this watershed. Model calibration is robust with Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients (NS'' s) and R-2'' s over 0.80 for both the calibration period and the validation period where the length of the validation period is five times longer than the calibration period. The significance is obvious when compared to the simulation without considering the effect of spatial variation in meteorological input (NS = 0.80 and NS = 0.47 for with lapse rates'' and without lapse rates'', respectively). Accurate meteorological input is of great importance to the distributed hydrological model, especially in the mountainous regions.","[Fang, Gonghuan; Yang, Jing; Chen, Yaning] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China; [Fang, Gonghuan] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Fang, Gonghuan; De Maeyer, Philippe] Univ Ghent, Dept Geog, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Xu, Changchun] Xinjiang Univ, Key Lab Oasis Ecol, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, Xinjiang 830046, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Ghent University; Xinjiang University","Yang, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Desert & Oasis Ecol, Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, 818 South Beijing Rd, Urumqi 830011, Xinjiang, Peoples R China.",yangjing@ms.xjb.ac.cn,"De Maeyer, Philippe/N-7152-2019; Chen, Yaning/A-2338-2019; Xu, Changchun/AAI-8797-2021; chen, yaning/AAN-8170-2020","De Maeyer, Philippe/0000-0001-8902-3855; Xu, Changchun/0000-0001-7737-0390; Fang, Gonghuan/0000-0002-1320-1835",Thousand Youth Talents Plan (Xinjiang Project) [Y371051]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41471030]; Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology [Y371163],Thousand Youth Talents Plan (Xinjiang Project); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology,"The research was supported by the Thousand Youth Talents Plan (Xinjiang Project: Y371051), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41471030) and the Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Desert and Oasis Ecology (Y371163).",,41,12,13,3,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1866-6280,1866-6299,,ENVIRON EARTH SCI,Environ.

J,"Daya, S",,,,"Daya, Shari",,,Saving the Other: Exploring the social in social enterprise,GEOFORUM,,,English,Article,,,,,,South Africa; Social enterprise; Craft; Power; Empowerment; Representation,RESEARCH AGENDA; SOUTH-AFRICA; ENTREPRENEURSHIP,"Social enterprise is increasingly viewed by governments worldwide as a promising means of promoting development. In South Africa, too, this sector is identified as a strategic growth area. Although there is no final consensus on the definition of social enterprise, certain characteristics are generally agreed. These include the idea that social enterprise prioritises social needs over profit maximisation, and involves marginalised people within viable businesses that have socially beneficial outcomes. Academic research on social enterprise has largely come from business studies, focusing on the internal functioning of social enterprise organisations, the figure of the social entrepreneur, the relationship between the social enterprise sector and the state, and on what the sector needs to flourish commercially. Social issues, especially analyses of power within the sector, have been relatively neglected. This paper addresses that gap, drawing on a wider development studies literature on the social economy to inform an examination of power relationships in the craft industry in South Africa, where narratives of social enterprise are pervasive. I argue that although empowerment is an explicit aim of many craft organisations, the most prominent discourses within the industry often rely on and perpetuate objectifying constructions of producers. These manifest particularly through notions of 'saving', shaping a moral economy that entrenches difference along lines of black white, north south, and healthy-diseased. Such discourses run counter to the aims of empowerment that are central to the ethos of social enterprise, and should challenge both policymakers and academics to think carefully about how power works within the sector.

But few have been designed specially for oases in arid desert areas where the ecology and the environment are vulnerable because of unwise water-land resources utilization. In order to analyze the moisture transformation in the Hotan Oasis in the Taklimakan Desert in China, and hence to provide scientific references for the rational exploitation and allocation of the limited water-land resources, for the purpose of ensuring that the vulnerable ecology and environment there can be gradually improved and the social economy there can develop sustainably, a dissipative hydrological model for the Hotan Oasis (DHMHO) was developed. It was an outcome of years of systematic study on the moisture transformation in arid areas and on the water-land conditions in the Hotan Oasis. Based on statistics, DHMHO introduces two empirical equations whereby we dynamically calibrated model parameters with monthly data from year 1971 to 1995. Then the calibrated parameters were used to model the moisture movement from 1996 to 2003 and thereafter rationality check and error analysis were conducted. The error analysis results show that the absolute relative errors between simulated and observed groundwater depth values are almost (11 of 12 points) within 20%, and those in annual watershed outflow simulation are mostly (six of eight points) within 20% with an average annual Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSEC) of 0.80. With DHMHO and IPCC assessment, we also simulated the moisture transformation and dissipation in the Hotan Oasis from the year 2011 to 2020. Results show details of the water resources in the Hotan Oasis in the next decade and hence are expected to provide scientific references for establishing rational exploitation and allocation policies on the local water-land resources in the future.","[Zhao, Changsen] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Water Resources & Environm, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Changsen; Shen, Bing; Huang, Lingmei] Xian Univ Technol, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Lei, Zhidong; Hu, Heping; Yang, Shixiu] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Hydraul Engn, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University; Xi'an University of Technology; Tsinghua University,"Zhao, CS (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Water Resources & Environm, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",hzjohnson2003@163.com; shenbing@xaut.edu.cn,"Zhao, Changsen/C-8107-2011",,Natural Science Foundation of China [50779052],Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by Project of the Natural Science Foundation of China ( No. 50779052).

The Red del Trueque, or 'Barter Network', in Argentina is the first of such systems to grow to a size which encroaches on the state monopoly over the money supply. This article begins with a basic primer on the functioning of the network and offers an explanation for its unprecedented growth in the Argentinean context. The central question addressed is whether the network can be described as petty capitalism, perfecting capitalism or post-capitalism. A socialized theory of economic relations is developed which argues for the existence of a reciprocal relationship between the behavioural norms governing monetary networks and the practices of those networks. Analysis suggests that the RT contains tendencies both supportive of and alternative to capitalist modes of organization, consistent with the history of utopian experiments. To succeed in its goal of creating an 'economy of solidarity', the Barter Network must develop a political alternative to accompany its heterodox economic organization.",,,,,,,,,,,78,12,16,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

On the other hand, we hope to demonstrate the diversity of behaviors within the category of cooperative firms, identifying the possible patterns of environmental proactivity in Spanish cooperatives in the wine sector. We first conducted a difference of meanst-test for independent samples (n= 251; sampled in 2017)-cooperatives (51) vs. non cooperative firms (200)- and then a two-stage cluster analysis and a subsequent variance analysis, using SPSS 24. Our results show no significant differences between cooperative and non-cooperative firms concerning their environmental behavior and underlines the diversity within the cooperatives in the wine sector as regards their environmental proactivity, revealing the existence of proactive, preventive and activist patterns of behavior.

Poor decisions in this regard can have serious consequences for sustainability in accordance with the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This case-study analyses the outcomes of an axiological and practical application of cooperative principles, with appropriate technological support, to the territorial governance of travel and hospitality services. It focuses on the implementation of an R&D+i project to create an online cooperative platform managing 40 destinations. The practical application of these principles is seen to require a shift in perspective, not only in terms of the conception of territory, going from a space of purely capital valorisation to a commonly-held co-constructed heritage asset, but also in the approach to the use of technology, which favours peer-based collective intelligence over blind artificial intelligence. The most notable features of the model identified by the findings are increased proximity and inclusiveness on the part of users, and enhanced sustainability. With respect to the technological platform, the analysis indicates that it is scalable and replicable, as demonstrated by the growth from 7 to 40 destinations in a single year.","[Miedes-Ugarte, Blanca; Flores-Ruiz, David] Univ Huelva, Dept Econ, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Wanner, Prosper] Univ Paris Diderot, Ctr Etud Sci Sociales CESSMA, Inalco, IRD, F-75205 Paris, France",Universidad de Huelva; Universite Paris Cite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Flores-Ruiz, D (corresponding author), Univ Huelva, Dept Econ, Huelva 21071, Spain.",miedes@uhu.es; david.flores@dege.uhu.es; pwanner@lesoiseauxdepassage.coop,"flores, david/X-6812-2018; Miedes-Ugarte, Blanca/A-6580-2013","flores, david/0000-0001-8386-8726; Miedes-Ugarte, Blanca/0000-0002-0667-997X","CIFRE-La convention industrielle de formation par la recherche of the Ministere de l'enseignement superieur, de la recherche et de l'innovation (France) [201420722T]; Cooperative Les Oiseaux de Passage; Spanish R&D+I project Educacion Patrimonial para la Inteligencia Territorial y Emocional de la Ciudadania [EDU2015-67953-P]","CIFRE-La convention industrielle de formation par la recherche of the Ministere de l'enseignement superieur, de la recherche et de l'innovation (France); Cooperative Les Oiseaux de Passage; Spanish R&D+I project Educacion Patrimonial para la Inteligencia Territorial y Emocional de la Ciudadania","This research is the result of a transdisciplinary collaboration between two research projects: the PhD project funded by CIFRE-La convention industrielle de formation par la recherche of the Ministere de l'enseignement superieur, de la recherche et de l'innovation (France) to the Centre d'Etudes en Sciences Sociales CESSMA, Universite Paris Diderot,-Inalco,-IRD (201420722T) jointly with the Cooperative Les Oiseaux de Passage (Jan 2019-Dec 2021); and the Spanish R&D+I project Educacion Patrimonial para la Inteligencia Territorial y Emocional de la Ciudadania.

This concept builds upon the interrelation between socioeconomic contexts of SI (meso-macro levels) and intra/inter-organizational dynamics (micro level), where SIs are developing. That is to say, the ways in which the social economy and social organizations are connected to a broader SI Ecosystem where the socioeconomic contexts surrounding National Welfare Regime try to answer to the policy and market failures that have an impact on regional vulnerability rates. This article suggests the hypothesis that there is an interrelation between the strength of Welfare Regimes and Social Innovation Ecosystems, at a time where Social Policies and Welfare States all over the world are weakened or in crisis, opening the door to social innovation. This paper describes this connection through the notion of Social Innovation Regime, proposing an interesting exploratory framework to explore the socio-structural factors through which a country or region presents a set of vulnerabilities which can transform into unattended social problems.

Field survey and theoretical analysis are applied to gain theoretical criterion of dynamic instability of layer rock mass. Numerical calculation, physical simulation, and field monitoring are adopted to comprehensively analyze spatial-temporal evolution characteristics of layer rock mass around roadway influenced by structural anisotropy. Results show that deformation and instability of layer rock mass on the roof side of roadway begins with synthetic bucking, which occurs in the middle position of excavated free face. In addition, deformation and instability on the floor side begins with shearing slip in the bottom corner. Furthermore, numerical calculation shows that horizontal spans of the dynamic instability district on the roof and floor side are 2.1 m and 1.7 m respectively. Physical simulation shows that stress-concentrated areas on the roof and floor side are located in the middle and foot position respectively, the horizontal distance between the stress-concentrated area on the roof and the excavated free face is 1.2 m, and the one on the floor side is 0.8 m. Support modes and parameters are optimized based on analysis. Site monitoring shows that the maximum cumulative convergence of roadway is 39.2 cm, deformation rate is reduced by 82.2%, and dynamic instability disasters of the steeply inclined coal seams are effectively controlled, which has made contribution for energy science and social economy construction.","[Yang, Yiran; Lai, Xingping; Shan, Pengfei; Cui, Feng] Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Resource, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Yang, Yiran; Lai, Xingping; Shan, Pengfei; Cui, Feng] Minist Educ, Key Lab Western Mines & Hazard Prevent, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Science & Technology,"Yang, YR (corresponding author), Xian Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Energy & Resource, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Yang, YR (corresponding author), Minist Educ, Key Lab Western Mines & Hazard Prevent, Xian 710054, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",yryangxa@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [2014CB260404],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2014CB260404).,,29,11,11,8,45,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1866-7511,1866-7538,,ARAB J GEOSCI,Arab.

The essay develops conceptualizations of social enterprise, the social economy, and solidarity economies before offering the novel concept of the antagonistic economy, arguably a site from which angry opposition to constraining power relations can generate a more productive politics of possibility.

The Belt and Road Initiative has always received much attention due to its special geographical location and great potential for economic development. At the same time, the Belt and Road region is also deeply affected by drought, especially in some countries and regions, where the agricultural infrastructure is weak and the ecological environment is fragile. How to effectively monitor and evaluate drought has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis data were used, and the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index was combined with Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) to study the temporal and spatial distribution of the 1989-2017 monthly scale of drought in different climate regions of the Belt and Road region. The results show that the overall change trend of arid area shows a change of up-down-up-down. The winter drought area is larger than the summer drought area, and the drought center gradually moves from the Southeast Asia region in winter to the West-Central Asia region in summer. In the past five years, the drought area decreased gradually at the rate of approximately 0.38 million km(2) per year.","[Xue, Changdi; Wu, Hua; Jiang, Xiaoguang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wu, Hua] Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Xiaoguang] Chinese Acad Sci, Acad Optoelect, Key Lab Quantitat Remote Sensing Informat Technol, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Academy of Opto-Electronics, CAS","Wu, H (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.;Wu, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, State Key Lab Resources & Environm Informat Syst, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Wu, H (corresponding author), Jiangsu Ctr Collaborat Innovat Geog Informat Reso, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",wuhua@igsnrr.ac.cn,"Wu, Hua/G-9271-2012","Wu, Hua/0000-0002-5982-8422","Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDA20030302, XDA19040403]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41871267]",Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(Chinese Academy of Sciences); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported partly by the Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences under grant nos.

J,"Palma, LV",,,,"Valiente Palma, Lidia",,,Is cooperativism helping to keep the population in Andalusia?,CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Andalusia; cooperative societies; territory; emigration; spatial regression,,"Rationale and current interest in topic Rural areas in Andalusia present clear disadvantages as compared to urban areas, such as lack of infrastructure, scarcity of basic services or lack of economic dynamics, causing a rural exodus and thus giving rise to territorial imbalances in the region. This rural exodus, in turn, has a limiting influence on the generation of economic dynamics, resulting in an increasingly ageing population and reducing opportunities for territorial development. In the face of this problem, cooperatives -societies of the social economy- may play a significant role in terms of their capacity for attaching a population to its territory, due to the existence of a relationship with the surroundings in which they operate, as demonstrated by the available literature on this topic (Garcia-Gutierrez, 1999; Buendia and Garcia, 2003; Coque, 2005; Mozas and Bernal, 2006; Cunat and Coll, 2007; Puentes and Velasco, 2009; Calvo and Gonzalez, 2011; Demoustier, 2011; Draperi, 2014; Guzman, Santos and Barroso, 2016; Perez and Valiente, 2017). Moreover, there is significant cooperativism in this region (with 19% of cooperatives and 18% of the employment these generate nationwide located in Andalusia) as well as consolidated institutional recognition of these organisations (as evinced by the laws which regulate them, as well as by the Pactos Andaluces por la Economia Social [Andalusia Agreements for the Social Economy] or by the various support programs for cooperative organisations).This represents an opportunity for the creation of economic dynamics and for attaching the population to its territory through the promotion of social economy societies. Objectives The main objective of this work consists in determining whether cooperative societies in Andalusia may be contributing to the maintenance of the region's population, especially in rural areas, to a greater extent than mercantile businesses. In addition to confirming whether this occurs throughout the entire population, we have separated out the populations of women and young people, due to the difficulties currently faced by these groups in joining the labour market (the main reason for emigration, especially in rural areas) and to their strategic interest in terms of consolidating the region's population, passing the inter-generational torch in local economic activities. A comparison of cooperative societies with mercantile businesses is carried out in order to lay the foundations for the establishment of strategies and policies for the specific promotion of cooperativism, in the event that the behaviour seen in these social economy organisations differs from that of mercantile businesses. Methodology In working towards the stated objective, and after an exploratory analysis of the variables used, spatial econometrics techniques were applied which take into account the location of the data in a given geographic space for the variables under study: spatial distribution and autocorrelation analysis graph-sand the application of spatial regression. Calculation of the models was carried out with GeoDa software. With respect to the variables used, these were the following: percentage of total emigration, percentage of emigration of young people and percentage of emigration of women were considered as dependent, proxy variables for the attachment of population to territory; the number of cooperatives out of the total number of businesses was established, as well as the number of mercantile businesses (public limited companies and limited liability companies) out of the total number of businesses, expressed as percentages, served as explanatory variables. These variables were obtained for the various Andalusian municipalities (a total of 770) for 2015. In addition, for the purpose of determining whether differences exist in emigration between rural and non-rural municipalities, a dummy variable was added, termed rural municipality or territory. Results, practical conclusions and research limitations The results obtained provide indications that cooperativism may be contributing to an attachment of the population to its territory (as compared to mercantile businesses, where a significant relationship was not seen), since the regression analyses demonstrated that the variable for percentage of cooperative societies is significant in explaining the variability seen in emigration. Moreover, both show an inverse relationship. The same was obtained when the said dependent variables used were percentage of emigration of women and young people. In other words, the proportion of cooperatives inversely influence these emigration rates, which is not the case for mercantile businesses. Based on the aforementioned and given that, on the one hand, difficulties in attaching a population to its territory are further complicated in rural Andalusian municipalities, especially for women and young people and, on the other hand, cooperativism inversely influences emigration from rural municipalities, the creation of quality, sustainable employment through cooperatives societies of social economy- may represent an opportunity for reducing problems of depopulation in these areas. Another result obtained is that the cooperative business culture may be spread to neighbouring regions to a lesser extent than that of the conventional business sector. If cooperativism can contribute to an attachment of population to territory, the application of specific policies and strategies for reducing emigration from rural areas -promoting the development of cooperative societies for the creation of quality, sustainable employment and thus spreading cooperative culture to a greater extent-becomes at once a challenge and an opportunity for Andalusia. From another perspective, business synergies between cooperativism and conventional businesses may be encouraged, making the most of the opportunity offered by the latter for spreading their culture to neighbouring regions to a greater degree than cooperativism. In this way, spreading the principles and values of cooperativism in the Andalusian region can be achieved at the same time as contributing to an attachment of population to territory, through a potential business inter-cooperation. Among the conclusions drawn, one also finds the need to carry out specific strategies and policies for promoting cooperativism in Andalusia, derived from results showing more heterogeneous behaviour in the region than seen in the conventional business sector. With regard to the limitations of this work, it should be noted that, in the first place, the analysis carried out is static in nature, based on specific moment in time (the year 2015), which represents a limitation for analysing the evolutionary dynamic followed by both cooperatives societies and emigration in Andalusia. In the second place, percentage of emigration was taken as a proxy or indicative variable, with respect to the difficulty in attaching a population to its territory. However, the presence of other factors must be taken into account: it may be that the percentage of emigration is low or null as a result of considerable ageing in the population, such that depopulation or difficulty in attaching population to territory would be caused, rather, by a lack of demographic growth. This work has established a number of future lines of research stemming in part from the very limitations indicated above, among which are the analysis of the evolutionary dynamic between cooperativism and emigration for the purpose of identifying the relationship these have followed over time; as well as consideration of other factors indicating capacity for attaching population to territory, such as the previously mentioned rate of demographic growth.","[Valiente Palma, Lidia] Univ Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz,"Palma, LV (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain.",lidia.valiente@uca.es,"Valiente, Lidia/GQZ-1271-2022","Valiente, Lidia/0000-0002-6054-3790",,,,,36,11,11,1,17,CIRIEC-ESPANA,VALENCIA,"AVE NARANJOS, S-N, EDIF DEP ORIENTAL 2P21, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",0213-8093,1989-6816,,CIRIEC,CIRIEC,NOV,2019,97,,,,,,49,74,,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.97.13046,http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.97.13046,,,26,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,JX0FI,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000503419400002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The occurrence of voltage sag will lead to a huge loss in the social economy and have a serious effect on people's daily life.

Therefore, with the measured data uploaded by the sag monitoring system, this paper proposes a sag type identification algorithm based on K-means-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD) and Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM). Firstly; each phase of the sag sample RMS data is sparsely coded by the K-SVD algorithm and the sparse coding information of each phase data is used as the feature matrix of the sag sample. Then the LS-SVM classifier is used to identify the sag type. This method not only works without any dependence on the sag data feature extraction by artificial ways, but can also judge the short-circuit fault phase, providing more effective information for the repair of grid faults. Finally, based on a comparison with existing methods, the accuracy advantages of the proposed algorithm with be presented.","[Sha, Haoyuan; Pan, Yi; Zheng, Jianyong] Southeast Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Sha, Haoyuan; Mei, Fei; Pan, Yi; Zheng, Jianyong] Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Smart Grid Technol & Equipment, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Mei, Fei] Hohai Univ, Coll Energy & Elect Engn, Nanjing 211100, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chenyu] State Grid Jiangsu Elect Power Co Ltd, Res Inst, Nanjing 211113, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China; Southeast University - China; Hohai University; State Grid Corporation of China,"Zheng, JY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Elect Engn, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Zheng, JY (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Jiangsu Key Lab Smart Grid Technol & Equipment, Nanjing 210096, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",230189232@seu.edu.cn; meifei@hhu.edu.cn; zhangcy7@js.sgcc.com.cn; 230159517@seu.edu.cn; jy_zheng@seu.edu.cn,"Pan, Yi/AAJ-2341-2021","Mei, Fei/0000-0001-5379-6522",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2018B15814],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This research was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, grant number 2018B15814.",,26,11,14,2,21,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1996-1073,,,ENERGIES,Energies,MAR 23,2019,12,6,,,,,,,1137,10.3390/en12061137,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en12061137,,,15,Energy & Fuels,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Energy & Fuels,HT3WR,,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000464494400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Firstly, factors determining the success of offline fundraising campaigns for social causes are identified from previous literature. Secondly, a set of hypotheses linking these determinants to DCF campaigns is proposed. Thirdly, their explanatory capacity is measured through quantitative analysis based on a database of 360 campaigns fostered by small, medium and large-size organizations via Microdonaciones, a donation-based crowdfunding digital platform, for the period between 2012 and 2017. Logistic regression analysis is used to test the hypotheses proposed. Results confirm the high explanatory capacity of determinants related to the geographical scope of the campaign, the volume of potential beneficiaries involved -in these two cases in unexpected ways-, and the information provided by the promoting organizations. However, factors related to the timing of the campaigns do not influence their success. This research suggests that not only the funding channels and tools but also the nature of the fundraising campaigns themselves have been digitally transformed.

This work discusses the main thematic areas in the scientific literature on the phenomenon of crowdfunding (RQ1) and how is crowdfunding treated in SMEs' dimension (RQ2). Design/methodology/approach To analyze the literature, this study uses structure literature review methodology. To answer RQ1, the articles in the SCOPUS database on the theme of crowdfunding were surveyed. To RQ2, the analysis focused on the combined theme between the crowdfunding phenomenon and the SMEs' dimension. Findings The study shows that from the scientific point of view, the treatment of the crowdfunding phenomenon is strongly developing in many research areas. The most recurrent are those that deal with studies linked to socio-geographical and institutional contexts and those that analyze individual behavior of investors and crowd funders. Residual area remains the one dedicated to SMEs, where this research has led to poor results.

The dual constraints of its water resources endowment and external policies force the developers of Zhangjiakou City to confront the dual restriction of the water supply support guarantee and control of water pollutants. The purpose of this paper was to realize water conservation on the premise of sustainable economic development. A linear optimization model, based on a dynamic input-output analysis, was developed to simulate the complex interrelationships between water resources and the social economy, and explore the optimal policies. The simulation results show that from 2013 to 2025, the targets of water conservation, including water retention and water environment control, will be achieved with an annual chemical oxygen demand emissions reduction rate of 12.6% and a constant annual real gross regional product rate of 4.3%.

Empirical studies have also confirmed that organisations adopting green technology or clean production are benefiting from increasing economic growth and job creation. However, the studies of the benefits of social development to economic growth and manufacturing sustainability have not been adequately captured or itemised in the literature. With the aim of contributing to this research streams, this paper applied the principles of social economy and reciprocity, and the theories of motivation and social exchange to guide the integration of social aspects into sustainability analytical equations. The Herzberg two-factor theory of motivation was adopted to classify the negative and positive social impacts of the workers' stakeholder category. Further, the approach aligns the Herzberg extrinsic factors with the negative and regulated social aspects and intrinsic factors with the positive and unregulated social aspects. This contribution provides an initial theoretical framework that will enable practitioners to capture and calculate the social impact coefficient of an organisation. The result can be used to assess the social impacts on productivity, and corporate social responsibility towards the employees. It will also provide an input for analytical or simulation models to assess the consequential effects of social aspects on other sustainability dimensions.","[Gbededo, Mijoh A.; Liyanage, Kapila] Univ Derby, Coll Engn & Technol, Markeaton St, Derby DE22 3AW, England",University of Derby,"Gbededo, MA (corresponding author), Univ Derby, Coll Engn & Technol, Markeaton St, Derby DE22 3AW, England.",m.gbededo@derby.ac.uk; k.liyanage@derby.ac.uk,"Gbededo, Mijoh/AAX-4787-2020","Gbededo, Mijoh/0000-0001-7455-8179; Liyanage, Kapila/0000-0002-4500-5783",,,,,54,11,16,1,24,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,MAR,2018,10,3,,,,,,,852,10.3390/su10030852,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10030852,,,20,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GA8DA,,"Green Accepted, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000428567100279,View Full Record in Web of Science

The analytical method used is quantitative descriptive analysis through Crosstab Analysis. The study presented that the accessibility is the most important factor influencing the use of social facilities. Furthermore, social facilities at a private housing development are more effective to conduct social interaction than at a public housing development. Social facilities at private housing developments have a significant role as spaces for gathering and fostering social relationships among residents. Meanwhile, social interaction among residents at a public housing development is regardless of the use of social facilities due to a sense of community.","[Yuliastuti, Nany; Purwoningsih, Purwoningsih] Diponegoro Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Jalan Prof Soedarto SH, Semarang 50275, Indonesia; [Sukmawati, Annisa Mu'awanah] Univ Technol Yogyakarta, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Jalan Glagahsari 63, Yogyakarta 55164, Indonesia",Diponegoro University,"Yuliastuti, N (corresponding author), Diponegoro Univ, Dept Urban & Reg Planning, Jalan Prof Soedarto SH, Semarang 50275, Indonesia.",n.yuliastuti@pwk.undip.ac.id,"Yuliastuti, Nany/FZS-2543-2022; Sukmawati, Annisa Mu'awanah/AAQ-5755-2020","Sukmawati, Annisa Mu'awanah/0000-0003-3095-5476; Yuliastuti, Nany/0000-0002-9700-0052",,,,,33,11,12,0,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",2631-6862,1938-7806,,ARCHNET-IJAR,Archnet-IJAR,MAR,2018,12,1,,,,,134,151,,10.26687/archnet-ijar.v12i1.1295,http://dx.doi.org/10.26687/archnet-ijar.v12i1.1295,,,18,Architecture,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Architecture,GC4HZ,,hybrid,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000429746900008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Such emergencies cause a serious threat to human health and public safety, especially in rural China. Owing to flaws in emergency management mechanism and policy, the government is not capable to effectively deal with public health emergencies. Therefore, this study aimed to discuss the path to improve the emergency management mechanism for public health emergency in rural China. Methods: This study was conducted in 2017 to detect the emergency management mechanism of public health crisis (EMMPHC) in Rural China. Data were collected using the following keywords: Rural China, public health emergency, emergency management mechanism, organization mechanism, operation mechanism in the databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and CNKI. Results: EMMPHC in rural China can be enhanced from the following three aspects. First, a permanent institution for rural emergency management with public health management function is established. Second, the entire process of emergency management mechanism, including the stages of pre-disaster, disaster, and post-disaster, is improved. Finally, investment in rural public health is increased, and an adequate reserve system for emergency resources is formed. Conclusion: The new path of EMMPHC in rural China can effectively help the local government accomplish the dispatch capability in public health emergency, and it has important research significance for the protection of public health and social stability of residents in rural China.","[Hu, Jiaxiang; Chen, Chao; Kuai, Tingting] Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Hu, Jiaxiang] Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Agricultural University; Nanjing Agricultural University,"Hu, JX (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Hu, JX (corresponding author), Nanjing Agr Univ, China Ctr Food Secur Studies, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",hujiaxiang2000@163.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of China [71403127]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [KJQN201561, SKTS2017003]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD)",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD),"This work was partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71403127), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. KJQN201561, SKTS2017003), and funded by the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).",,35,11,12,10,143,IRANIAN SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY,TEHRAN,"SCHOOL PUBLIC HEALTH & INST HEALTH RESEARCH, TEHRAN UNIV MEDICAL SCIENCES, P O BOX 6446-14155, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN",2251-6085,2251-6093,,IRAN J PUBLIC HEALTH,Iran J.

Pigs currently play a key role in social economy and community cultural identity in Latin America. The aim of this study was to establish conservation priorities among a comprehensive group of Criollo pig breeds based on a set of 24 microsatellite markers and using different criteria. Spain and Portugal pig breeds, wild boar populations of different European geographic origins and commercial pig breeds were included in the analysis as potential genetic influences in the development of Criollo pig breeds. Different methods, differing in the weight given to within-and between-breed genetic variability, were used in order to estimate the contribution of each breed to global genetic diversity. As expected, the partial contribution to total heterozygosity gave high priority to Criollo pig breeds, whereas Weitzman procedures prioritized Iberian Peninsula breeds. With the combined within-and between-breed approaches, different conservation priorities were achieved. The Core Set methodologies highly prioritized Criollo pig breeds (Cr. Boliviano, Cr. Pacifico, Cr. Cubano and Cr. Guadalupe). However, weighing the between-and within-breed components with FST and 1-FST, respectively, resulted in higher contributions of Iberian breeds. In spite of the different conservation priorities according to the methodology used, other factors in addition to genetic information also need to be considered in conservation programmes, such as the economic, cultural or historical value of the breeds involved.","[Cortes, O.; Canon, J.; Sevane, N.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Vet, Dept Prod Anim, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Martinez, A.

Apart from being providers of employment opportunities for vulnerable groups, they are often important initiators of lasting projects, providing a series of services that normally should have been offered by the government. Although social economy is given an increasingly greater attention in literature, the impact of this specific sector to the development of tourism has not been deeply researched, thus remaining largely unknown. To this aim, the article will discuss the relationship between social economy and tourism. Apart from providing a literature review regarding social economy, its vehicles and their impact on tourism, the paper includes a research using secondary data, collected from external sources: statistical data indicating the development of the social economy sector and the record of the number of tourists in all the development regions of Romania. The results indicate that the regions registering the largest number of associations and foundations active in the field of tourism have recorded a positive evolution in the number of tourist arrivals. The research can be further developed in a more complex study, addressing professionals in this specific economy sector. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The spatial form and structural evolution was analysed by studying indices such as city land-use structure proportion, expansion intensity, economic flexibility, population flexibility, changing compactness index and so on. The dynamic mechanism of urban land expansion has been discussed by integrating the regional social economy development situation and many aspects such as the physiographical surrounding, population and economic development, traffic infrastructure, planning and regional development tactic and system innovation. The research indicates that the urban land expansion speed and intensity have steadily increased in Changsha from 1949 to 2004. The expansion form has been from a single external expansion to a combination form of external and internal expansion, from a circular or linear continuous form to a blocky or agglomeration shape. Overall, the urban land expansion of Changsha city is a phasic, diversified and complex process. And no matter what the stage is, it is an organic system containing multiple speed, pattern and shape, which are driven by multiple impetuses. The dominant feature at different stages was highlighted because of the balance and fluctuation between different forces, and the existing urban land border and shape have resulted from the joint efforts of these phasic forces.","[Zhou Guohua; He Yanhua] Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Sci Resource & Environm Sci, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China",Hunan Normal University,"Zhou, GH (corresponding author), Hunan Normal Univ, Coll Sci Resource & Environm Sci, Changsha 410081, Peoples R China.",uuy828@163.com,"Zhou, Guanghui/H-4281-2014","Zhou, Guanghui/0000-0002-1536-3440",,,,,23,11,13,1,26,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

The experience of Quebec, Canada, is used to illustrate how, in the absence of this institutional programme, existing centres of state power can deflect the social economy in a neoliberal direction.","Univ Montreal, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Universite de Montreal,"Graefe, P (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",,,"Graefe, Peter/0000-0002-1499-2691",,,,,66,11,13,0,12,POLICY PRESS,BRISTOL,"UNIV BRISTOL, 1-9 OLD PARK HILL, BRISTOL BS2 8BB, ENGLAND",0305-5736,1470-8442,,POLICY POLIT,Policy Polit.,APR,2002,30,2,,,,,247,262,,10.1332/0305573022501674,http://dx.doi.org/10.1332/0305573022501674,,,16,Political Science; Public Administration,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Government & Law; Public Administration,551EA,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000175545500007,View Full Record in Web of Science

In place of the natural economy view of a market apart from the state, we offer a social economy view of the inescapable social structuring of markets through state regulation. Even when states institute policies which prevent interference in a market, the enforcement power of the state is no less required. We thus distinguish between two forms of regulation: negative regulation - regulation which prevents interference - and positive regulation - regulation which enables interference. These two forms of regulation make possible two different conceptions of freedom, what Isaiah Berlin once termed negative freedom from agency and positive freedom to have agency. We argue that positive and negative freedom and positive and negative regulation are inseparable; freedom is always contextual. Through a discussion of the debate between industrial agriculture and environmentalists, we show that both supporters and critics of the free market are alike in their advocacy, often unacknowledged, of both negative and positive forms of regulation. Rather then a lessening of regulation, this debate represents the institution of anew regulatory regime out of the contest of interests. We conclude by considering the implications for democracy of the contextual character of freedom. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This paper investigates the long term trends of high temperature events in three major cities (Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang) of northern China during 1970-2019, and quantifies the contributions of main influencing factors to the variability of high temperature days. High temperature events in Beijing-Tianjin-Shijiazhuang cities mainly occur from June to July and account for 60-65% of the annual total, showing a significant upward trend in the interannual change. There is a trend of high temperature events starting early and ending late in recent 50 years, and this trend is intensified by the increasing urbanization. Due to geographical location and city scale, the frequency and intensity of high temperature events show difference among Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang cities. Variance analysis shows that climate warming contributes 20.2-25.5% to the variability of high temperature days, while urban heat island accounts for 14.7-24.2%, equal to the sum of the contributions from atmospheric circulation and solar activity.","[Zheng, Zuofang; Wang, Yaoting; Li, Qingchun] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Urban Meteorol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xu, Guirong] China Meteorol Adm, Inst Heavy Rain, Hubei Key Lab Heavy Rain Monitoring & Warning Res, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiangbo] Hebei Meteorol Observ, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, Peoples R China",China Meteorological Administration; China Meteorological Administration,"Xu, GR (corresponding author), China Meteorol Adm, Inst Heavy Rain, Hubei Key Lab Heavy Rain Monitoring & Warning Res, Wuhan 430205, Peoples R China.",grxu@whihr.com.cn,,,,,,,40,10,10,5,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1530-261X,,,ATMOS SCI LETT,Atmos.

Despite the current research efforts, some questions remain open, including the active interaction among resources, the optimal configuration of multi-level resources for manufacturing tasks, and the dynamic evolution of communities in manufacturing networks. In order to realize the optimal configuration across different enterprises, in this paper, an overall architecture for the optimal configuration of manufacturing resources based on community evolution was proposed. Under the architecture, unique manufacturing resources were encapsulated to multi-level manufacturing services, and they aggregated together autonomously to accomplish upper-level service demands according to semantic matching. Focusing on the matching efficiency between services and demands, three types of communities were developed for the resource configuration, which was realized by the grey relation analysis, the Louvain algorithm, and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. The presented methods were demonstrated by a case of drive-shaft production, and some observations and findings were discussed in detail. The results showed that the proposed methods could benefit both customers and manufacturers, which may promote the implementation of social manufacturing effectively.","[Zhang, Yingfeng; Zhang, Dang; Wang, Zhe; Qian, Cheng] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yingfeng; Zhang, Dang; Qian, Cheng] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Energy Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University; Southern University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, YF (corresponding author), Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Mech Engn, Dept Ind Engn, Xian 710072, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.;Zhang, YF (corresponding author), Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Mech & Energy Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",zhangyf@nwpu.edu.cn,"Qian, Cheng/P-7908-2016; z, y/HPC-0477-2023",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [51675441]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [31020190505001]; 111 Project Grant of Northwestern Polytechnical University [B13044],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); 111 Project Grant of Northwestern Polytechnical University,"The authors would like to acknowledge the financial supports of National Natural Science Foundation of China (51675441), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (31020190505001) and the 111 Project Grant of Northwestern Polytechnical University (B13044).

Researchers conducted 558 face-to-face surveys to study the societal acceptance of this sector in several dimensions (social, economy, quality, environment, etc.). We have also built an index to measure this acceptance, based on the variables studied to delve into this concept. For this purpose, we have followed a principal component analysis methodology with Varimax rotation, to which we have applied the Dalenius-Hodges stratification procedure. Analysis shows a high level of acceptance for aquaculture, indicating that it is far from its social saturation point. Rather, data indicate that even further development of this activity is advisable. In addition, respondents showed some indifference between socioeconomic and environmental objectives. We can conclude that the general perception of aquaculture is better among men than women, who have greater preferences for traditional fishing, and among higher-income consumers. Informative campaigns should be organized to target the less convinced consumers, in the context of social carrying capacity. Production systems should be adjusted to improve the existing perception that aquaculture products are less natural; this perception arises from the misuse of chemicals and feeds, factors that are believed to have adverse effects on quality and flavour.","[Ruiz-Chico, Jose; Biedma-Ferrer, Jose Maria; Pena-Sanchez, Antonio Rafael; Jimenez-Garcia, Mercedes] Univ Cadiz, Inst Univ Invest Desarrollo Social Sosenible, Avda Univ S-N, Jerez de la Frontera 11406, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz,"Ruiz-Chico, J (corresponding author), Univ Cadiz, Inst Univ Invest Desarrollo Social Sosenible, Avda Univ S-N, Jerez de la Frontera 11406, Spain.",jose.ruizchico@uca.es,"Chico, José Ruiz/AAP-3319-2020; JIMÉNEZ GARCÍA, MERCEDES/U-9879-2018; BIEDMA-FERRER, JOSE MARIA/ABD-1933-2020","JIMÉNEZ GARCÍA, MERCEDES/0000-0002-4180-2216; BIEDMA-FERRER, JOSE MARIA/0000-0002-5120-4447; Pena Sanchez, Antonio Rafael/0000-0001-8482-3423; Ruiz Chico, Jose/0000-0003-4544-9541","Pleamar Program; Instituto Universitario de Investigacion para el Desarrollo Social Sostenible [University Research Institute for Sustainable Social Development] (INDESS), Universidad de Cadiz, Spain; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (FEMP)","Pleamar Program; Instituto Universitario de Investigacion para el Desarrollo Social Sostenible [University Research Institute for Sustainable Social Development] (INDESS), Universidad de Cadiz, Spain; European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (FEMP)","This paper is part of the Integrated, Innovative and Participatory Management of the Natura 2000 Network in Spain's Marine Environment project of LIFE IP INTEMARES coordinated by the Ministry for Ecological Transition, through the Fundacion Biodiversidad and CTAQUA (Andalusian Aquaculture Technology Center).

In China, the restructuring of domestic agriculture and liberalisation of trade following accession to the World Trade Organization have led to the growing reliance on imported food and raised concerns for food self-sufficiency and safety. Inspired by the concept of social economy, social workers in China have explored alternative pathways towards sustainable food production and consumption through local initiatives. Based on participatory action research in a Chinese village, this study examines the potential contribution of social work intervention in responding to China's agrarian challenges.

Because of their distinct architecture, rituals, and history, temples have become an important part of the sustainable development of temple economies. Thailand, a tourism-rich country in Southeast Asia, has many Chinese temples, most of which have developed into well-known tourist attractions. However, little research has explored attraction factor categories of Thai-Chinese temples as cultural tourist attractions, and also the relationships among these factor categories. This knowledge is important for assessing and developing improvement strategies of Thai-Chinese temples for achieving a sustainable temple economy. Thus, this study aims to identify appropriate ways to identify the constituent attraction factor categories of Thai-Chinese temples as cultural tourist attractions and how they are prioritized, considering the complex interaction relationships among them. The research findings show that 12 main factor categories under the three dimensions, three attributive classifications with different priorities to which the 12 categories belong, and the complex interaction relationships among factor categories are identified. Combining the priorities on attributive classifications and the priorities on interaction relationships, the sustainable improvement strategies of Thai-Chinese temples are established. This paper extends previous research on Chinese temples, offers insights into the theoretical investigation of Thai-Chinese temples as tourist attractions, and provides decision makers with an integrated and practical way to establish priorities of multiple attraction factor categories, in order to make sustainable improvement strategies of Thai-Chinese temples under the consideration of rational allocation of resources.","[Zhu, Bo-Wei] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Humanities & Arts, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macao, Peoples R China; [Huang, Zheng] Silpakorn Univ, Fac Decorat Arts, Ratchamankha Nai Rd, Amphoe Muang 73000, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand; [Xiong, Lei] South China Normal Univ, Acad Fine Arts, 55 Zhongshan Ave, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology; South China Normal University,"Xiong, L (corresponding author), South China Normal Univ, Acad Fine Arts, 55 Zhongshan Ave, Guangzhou 510631, Peoples R China.",zhubowei301@gmail.com; 2003082@glut.edu.cn; kmt20005@gmail.com,"Zhu, Bo-Wei/Y-1706-2019; Lei, Xiong/AAH-3447-2020","Zhu, Bo-Wei/0000-0002-4982-1286; Xiong, Lei/0000-0002-5398-415X",Graduate Education Innovation Project (GEIP) of Guangdong Province [2019JGXM36],Graduate Education Innovation Project (GEIP) of Guangdong Province,"This study is funded by the Graduate Education Innovation Project (GEIP) of Guangdong Province, and the project number is 2019JGXM36.",,32,10,10,3,29,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-1444,,RELIGIONS,Religions,APR,2020,11,4,,,,,,,199,10.3390/rel11040199,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rel11040199,,,19,Religion,Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Religion,LO8XV,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000533909900003,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"García-Flores, V; Martos, LP",,,,"Garcia-Flores, Victor; Palma Martos, Luis",,,Social innovation: Key factors for its development in the territories,CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Social innovation; third sector; public sector; qualitative analysis; social economy; territorory,PARADIGM,"Currently, the term innovation is often associated with the generation of new technologies, excluding other forms of innovation, with equal or greater value, such as social innovation. Technological innovation has been repeatedly used as a means differentiation in order to achieve a higher enterprise competitiveness. This has led to achievement of great scientific and technical progress. Nevertheless, in the last few decades, this has not prevented some territories from social issues such as poverty, exclusion, inequality, deterioration of environmental conditions and unemployment, among others. All these problems have a high local impact, being here where social innovation importance as a force for potential change is growing. Despite the broad consensus regarding the potential and the positive effects that social innovation has in those territories, there is still considerable debate surrounding how this concept should be defined and what factors contribute to its appearance. There are many variables that have been mentioned in the literature; however, a review of previous works shows that it is an open field for the identification of new ones. As described above, this paper has three main aims: to analyze the state of the art up to now, to give a definition of social innovation and to identify, analyze and weigh those key factors for its emergence in the territories. To this end we have designed a methodology based on a series of qualitative analysis techniques. Firstly, a review of the state of the art has been carried out to obtain a first approximation to the concept of social innovation and determine which elements are decisive in its appearance. Secondly, based on the existing literature and knowing what the problem is, we complete the methodology by designing and conducting semi-structured interviews. We chose this technique because we understand that social innovation is a living and constantly evolving phenomenon. This makes it very useful and allows us to confront the ideas and evidence from our literature review in a pragmatic way. The information gathered from the interviews allow us to identify, in a reliable and empirical way, new key elements to define social innovation. Additionally, the interviews help us to recognize and weigh the existence of new essential factors for the development of social innovation. These interviews have been conducted with a total of 24 agents involved in social innovation processes: managers and directors of centers responsible for promoting social innovation; agents that developed socially innovative initiatives; and scientists and academics who published work in this field. To analyze the content of the 24 interviews, we used the Atlas.ti computer program. This tool helped us analyze the transcripts. In order to explore and interpret the texts we analyzed 24 primary archives, which represent one transcript for each interview carried out. Afterwards, we encoded them. This process is a form of data reduction, since, based on a large volume of information, we managed to segment certain pieces of information (quotes) and label them based on codes. These are the main elements of analysis and they are considered as a system of categories. In our case, each time we have identified a quote, which made reference to the existence of a factor that conditioned the irruption of social innovation or that enunciated characteristics that defined it, we labeled a code-referred to a certain factor related to the content of the quotes-. Once the individual coding and data editing was completed, we organized the codes into families. Specifically, in line with the main purposes of our analysis, in two families: one to collect the codes related to the definition of social innovation and a second to gather those related to its determinant factors. To provide our study with greater depth, it was essential to carry out a statistical analysis of the content that would allow us to know the frequency of appearance of the codes. First, we calculated the absolute frequency of the codes, referred to the number of times a quote was identified with the same code. Nevertheless, to obtain more information about the importance of each one of the codes, we relativized them considering that they had previously been divided into families. Thus, we have obtained the relative frequency by families, which is, the number of times any code is repeated within a family according to the total number of times codes included in that family appear. This contributes directly to know which factors have more strength in the emergence of social innovation, among the ones pointed out by the interviewers. After the performance of the aforementioned analysis, we suggest the following definition of social innovation: Practices or initiatives carried out by the community that, based on the products, services or models they generate, or through the process designed to achieve their objectives, they reach solutions that give a better response, in an alternative and creative way, to social problems or needs. In addition, we point out five key points for the development of social innovation: social and cultural elements; political and institutional support; knowledge and facilitating mechanisms; spatial components and entities; and mechanisms that determine the corporate and social productive structure. These gather 29 factors identified and weighted according to the number of times they were indicated by the interviewees. Therefore, this work, not only points out the key factors of social innovation and the foundations on which they are grouped by theme, but also shows the importance of each underlying determinant according to its absolute and relative frequencies. These frequencies are used as a proxy to weigh the importance of these factors and foundations. This allows to know which ones are more needed and have more weight in the emergence of social innovations. The ten factors with more impact are: the socioeconomic level of the population (0.09532), the existence of strategies and lines of action to develop social innovation (0.08838), the existence of laboratories or centers of social innovation (0.05892), the existence of public funding (0.05892), the existence of social concern (0.05719), the cultural propensity to change (0.05719), knowledge of the local reality (0.05545), knowledge of the opportunities and potential of new means and instruments (0.04506), links encouraging public-private relations (0.04332) and the existence of cooperatives (0.03986). In summary, it should be noted that the recognition of these factors, together with the weighing of their relative importance, represents a considerable innovation with respect to the existing texts. This work has allowed us to verify the suitability of some determining factors that had previously been pointed out in other studies, state new ones that emerged after the investigation, explain the correlation between them and present how important and what role each of them plays to have a beneficial ecosystem for social innovation. This knowledge can be very useful when establishing lines and criteria for the design of prioritization strategies, useful where there are restrictions of a political, organizational or budgetary nature.","[Garcia-Flores, Victor; Palma Martos, Luis] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"García-Flores, V; Martos, LP (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",vgarcia10@us.es; lpalma@us.es,,"Garcia-Flores, Victor/0000-0001-8273-4902",,,,,63,10,13,3,36,CIRIEC-ESPANA,VALENCIA,"AVE NARANJOS, S-N, EDIF DEP ORIENTAL 2P21, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",0213-8093,1989-6816,,CIRIEC,CIRIEC,NOV,2019,97,,,,,,245,278,,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.97.14148,http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.97.14148,,,34,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,JX0FI,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000503419400008,View Full Record in Web of Science

The entire core was divided into four periods. Multi-parametric measurements, their ratios and interrelations are seen to clearly reflect the development of agriculture, aquaculture, industry and social economy surrounding Daya Bay. The trends of TOC, TOM and BSi after 1990 may be due to mass input of nutritious matter from aquaculture and industry, whereas the trends of BSi, TOC and TOM between 1960 and 1990 were owing to aquaculture and agriculture. Two peaks of BSi, TOC and TOM in 1994 and 2002 imply that the mass input of cooling water from nuclear power plants may be a significant contributor to ecological environment changes.

Twelve land-use maps were interpreted from Landsat Thematic Mapper images using feature enhancement technology and Naive Bayes-based weight vector AdaBoost (WV AdaBoost). The study shows that since 1987, with heavily cultivated land being lost and vegetation cover shrinking, the urban area has doubled in size. The effects of human activities on the landscape have become increasingly apparent and complicated. It also finds that the expansion pattern has been transformed from one in which the city's main urban area engulfed the surrounding residential area to one in which surrounding towns expanded, driven by the development of the main urban area. By analysing the relationship between the social economy, population, and land-use change, we show that the forces driving expansion of the urban area have differed in different periods. The principal driving forces are national policymaking and adjustment, the aggregation and diffusion of population and economic development. Multitemporal land-use maps allow long-term dynamic monitoring of urban land cover in Guangzhou and provide important details of urban expansion and changes in land use. We employed intervals of 2 and 3 years, and our results provide good supporting data for studies of urban extension trends and reasonable urban planning.","[He, Yi; Yan, Haowen; Zhang, Lifeng; Yang, Shuwen] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geomat, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [He, Yi; Yan, Haowen; Yang, Shuwen] Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Gansu Prov Engn Lab Natl Geog State Monitoring, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Dou, Peng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Lanzhou Jiaotong University; Lanzhou Jiaotong University; Sun Yat Sen University,"He, Y (corresponding author), Lanzhou Jiaotong Univ, Fac Geomat, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",heyi8738@163.com,Peng/AAP-6413-2021,,"National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0504201]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371435, 41401050]",National Key R&D Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work is funded by the National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFB0504201] and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41371435 and 41401050].,,50,10,11,1,25,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

In this work, we established multiple scenarios to evaluate the impacts of land use change, population growth, carbon emission per capita, and carbon markets on carbon budget. We quantified carbon sinks (aboveground and belowground) under different scenarios, using the Carnegie-AmesStanford Approach (CASA) model and an improved carbon cycle process model, and studied carbon sources caused by human activities by analyzing the spatial distribution of human population and carbon emission per capita. We also assessed the net present value (NPV) for carbon budgets under different carbon price and discount rate scenarios using NPV model. Our results indicate that the carbon budget of Guanzhong-Tianshui Economic Region is surplus: Carbon sinks range from 1.50 x 10(10) to 1.54 x 10(10) t, while carbon sources caused by human activities range from 2.76 x 10(5) to 7.60 x 105 t. And the NPV for carbon deficits range from 3.20 x 10(11) RMB to 1.52 x 10(12) RMB. From the perspective of ecological management, deforestation, urban sprawl, population growth, and excessive carbon consumption are considered as the main challenges in balancing carbon sources and sinks.

Satellite images acquired by fast-developing remote-sensing techniques provide frequent observations of the land surface, thereby allowing for continuous mapping of urbanization activities. In this study, we investigated the annual urbanization activities over the past three decades in Guangzhou, one of the largest metropolises in China. To enhance the efficiency of training sample extraction in long-term land-cover mapping, we developed a three-step method: 1) three spectral indices were derived to extract the candidates of training samples based on decision trees; 2) a spatial filter was used to extract homogenous samples for each landcover type; and 3) temporal consistency checking was performed for the samples of urban areas. We applied the developed method to time-series Landsat images and produced annual land-cover maps of Guangzhou from 1987 to 2015. We evaluated the produced land-cover maps and found an average overall accuracy of 89.80% for all studied years. Our results show that dramatic urbanization has occurred in the region of the Guangzhou city, where built-up areas have mostly expanded to the northwest, east, and south of the central regions of Guangzhou. The average growth rate of urban areas in Guangzhou from 1987 to 2015 was at 38.72 km(2) per year, which was generally consistent with the government survey data. Future studies are required to understand how rapid urbanization in Guangzhou influences social economy and environmental sustainability.","[Sun, Ying; Zhang, Xinchang; Zhao, Yuan; Xin, Qinchuan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Earth & Environm Bldg D405, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China",Sun Yat Sen University,"Zhang, XC (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Geog & Planning, Earth & Environm Bldg D405, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",eeszxc@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Xin, Qinchuan/O-3276-2014","Xin, Qinchuan/0000-0003-1146-4874","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401484, 41431178, 41671453]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong province, China [2016A030311016]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong province, China(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province)","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Numbers: 41401484, 41431178, and 41671453]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong province, China [Grant Number: 2016A030311016].",,55,10,10,2,46,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0143-1161,1366-5901,,INT J REMOTE SENS,Int.

Focusing on the South Korean case, this paper analyzes the developmental path of the social economy in light of two factors: the degree of state involvement in the social economy, and SEOs' political power. Based on these two factors, we develop four ideal types of the social economy: (1) a quasi-governmental social economy, (2) government-SEO partnership, (3) a marketized social economy, and (4) an autonomous social economy. The Korean case shows a path where politically strong SEOs and a strong interventionist state incubate the social economy. However, it also presents SEOs' struggle to maintain their political influence to develop as an independent sector, without being occupied by the government or market.

Economy of mutuality, it is contended, provides an alternative frame of reference to the dichotomy of market economy and social economy, for inquiry about what business is for and what values it presupposes and creates. The article centers around the objective of gaining a broadened understanding of business so as to include not just market economy, but social enterprise and social economy. In pursuit of this objective, a range of various archetypes of business enterprise are considered in light of higher ends of economic life. The highest telos of business encompassing all such archetypes, it is argued, is founded on reciprocity and integral human development. The article concludes that, compared to market economy per se, economy of mutuality provides a better conceptual framework for business in undertaking the challenges of sustainability.","[Jackson, Kevin T.] Fordham Univ, New York, NY 10023 USA; [Jackson, Kevin T.] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium",Fordham University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Jackson, KT (corresponding author), Fordham Univ, New York, NY 10023 USA.",kjackson@law.fordham.edu,"Jackson, Kevin/AAF-1859-2020","Jackson, Kevin/0000-0001-8479-9347",,,,,89,10,18,1,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

The paper presents a qualitative research conducted on Romanian social entrepreneurs. The results, interpreted through content analysis, indicate that social entrepreneurs, unlike business entrepreneurs, are not profit-driven, but mission driven, their main objective being to make a difference in the society and have a positive impact in the local communities. Furthermore, the research revealed specific challenges faced by Romanian social entrepreneurs, as well as specific differences between social and business entrepreneurs, who aim strictly achieving economic performance.

The first is the question of how agendas for fair trade research should be developed. The second issue is the existence of major gaps in the fair trade literature including the study of the particular features of fair trade practice in individual northern countries. In taking up the first of these issues, the paper proposes that normative analysis should provide the basis for developing research agendas. Such an approach is important to ensure that the necessary types of questions to make nonnitive judgments and policy decisions are posed and that biases that tend to favor mainstreaming practices in the generation of knowledge are minimized. The paper addresses the second research issue by examining the development of research agendas at the level of individual countries, using Canada as a case.","[Reed, Darryl; Hussey, Ian] York Univ, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada; [Thomson, Bob] TransFair Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hussey, Ian] Canadian Students Fair Trade Network, Victoria, BC, Canada; [LeMay, Jean-Frederic] Equiterre, NGO, Montreal, PQ, Canada",York University - Canada,"Reed, D (corresponding author), York Univ, Toronto, ON M3J 2R7, Canada.",dreed@yoriat.ca,"Reed, Darryl/HTN-5609-2023; Reed, Darryl W/I-1947-2012","Reed, Darryl W/0000-0002-9553-5205",,,,,62,10,11,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

This paper analyses the institutional trajectory of social enterprise in Korea and its close relation with the concept of social economy. A socio-economic analysis of this trajectory reveals that it is strongly driven by successive consensus towards socially useful organisational forms that remain first relatively unknown and local, and then tend to attract the attention of a growing number of stakeholders, including central and local governments, to eventually generate specific public schemes and laws. Through this analysis, one can understand how far an economic concept like social enterprise is the result of a social construct that depends on the involvement of the public side and the civil society and social movement. It also stresses how important is the decisive role played by relatively minor actors to generate a consensus between different stakeholders and disseminate thus social innovation to reshape public action and public/private forms of partnerships.","[Bidet, Eric] Le Mans Univ, Lab ARGUMans, Le Mans, France; [Eum, Hyungsik] Univ Liege, Ctr Econ Sociale, Liege, Belgium; [Eum, Hyungsik] Alliance Cooperat Int, Brussels, Belgium",Le Mans Universite; University of Liege,"Bidet, E (corresponding author), Le Mans Univ, Lab ARGUMans, Fac Droit, Econ,Gest, Ave Olivier Messiaen, F-72000 Le Mans, France.",ericbidet@hotmail.com,"Bidet, Eric/JWQ-0444-2024",,,,,,54,9,9,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

There is a close connection between economic sector structure and employment structure, and the synergy between these two is an important index to measure the sustainable development of a social economy. This paper studies the degree of synergy within the three sectors from the three dimensions of employment elasticity, degree of structural deviation, and labor productivity ratio. The results show that the employment elasticity of the three sectors presents different characteristics and that the tertiary sector has the most significant driving effect on employment. The imbalance between the primary and secondary sector structures and the employment structure is relatively prominent. The labor productivity ratio of the three sectors is slightly superior to the national level in the same period. The tertiary sector has the strongest ability to absorb labor and the highest degree of synergy. The purpose of this study is to analyze the employment absorption capacity of the three industries and provide guidance for the government and relevant departments to formulate industrial development policies.","[Ding, YingYing] Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Agr Sage Culture, Weifang 262700, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Li, Zheng] Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business Adm, Weifang 262700, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Ge, Xiaojun] Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ & Management, Weifang 262700, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yu] China Inst Marine Technol & Econ, Educ Training & Management Res Ctr, Beijing 100000, Peoples R China",,"Ding, YY (corresponding author), Weifang Univ Sci & Technol, Res Ctr Agr Sage Culture, Weifang 262700, Shandong, Peoples R China.",guyd@nsfc.gov.cn,"ding, Yunya/HHS-9589-2022; Ding, Yuyan/HWQ-3664-2023",,National Social Science Fund of China [17BZZ052]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71602042],National Social Science Fund of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This paper is supported by National Social Science Fund of China (17BZZ052) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (71602042).,,19,9,9,2,37,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0040-1625,1873-5509,,TECHNOL FORECAST SOC,Technol.

Using the data of meteorology and social-economy statistics of Nanjing area, the paper selected ten indicators to establish the risk assessment system of urban rainstorm disaster from the aspects of the vulnerability of hazard-affected body, the fragility of disaster-pregnant environment, and the danger of hazard factors. Multi-layer weighted principal component analysis (MLWPCA) is an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA). The MLWPCA is based on factor analysis for the division subsystem. Then the PCA is used to analyze the indicators in each subsystem and weighted to synthesize. ArcGIS is used to describe regional differences in the urban rainstorm disaster risk. Results show that the MLWPCA is more targeted and discriminatory than principal component analysis in the risk assessment of urban rainstorm disaster. Hazard-affected body and disaster-pregnant environment have greater impacts on the risk assessment of rainstorm disaster in Nanjing, but the influence of hazard factors is few. Spatially, there is a large gap in the rainstorm disaster risk in Nanjing.

Marine tourism has developed into the core industry of marine economy, and the future development prospects are bright. However, in the face of the blind exploitation of marine resources, it has caused serious damage to marine ecology. If the marine ecology can not be repaired and protected in time, the impact on marine tourism development will be devastating. Marine tourism is a brand new industry. After years of development, it has become the pillar of marine economy, and the future development space is huge. In recent years, the number of tourists received by the marine tourism industry has shown an upward trend every year, which also makes marine tourism face severe challenges. Therefore, digging deep into the development potential of marine tourism resources, deepening the quality and management level of tourism services, is an important way to meet the actual needs of tourists, optimize the existing industrial structure of tourism, and is also an important direction for the sustainable development of marine tourism industry.","[Yan, Shuling] Henan Econ & Trade Vocat Coll, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China",,"Yan, SL (corresponding author), Henan Econ & Trade Vocat Coll, Zhengzhou 450000, Peoples R China.",yrjwvh@163.com,,,,,,,4,9,10,0,27,COASTAL EDUCATION & RESEARCH FOUNDATION,COCONUT CREEK,"5130 NW 54TH STREET, COCONUT CREEK, FL 33073 USA",0749-0208,1551-5036,,J COASTAL RES,J.

Thus, the involvement of seniors in non-profit organizations (NPO), the third sector, or the social economy is encouraged by European national governments. At the organizational level, the situation for older volunteers in the third sector has improved in recent years, mainly due to European legal regulations. Despite a certain degree of homogenization across European countries, significant national differences persist in the adoption and promotion of volunteering. The present study examines the link between self-reported health and participation in volunteering activities among European seniors, stratified by sex and generation (the Silent Generation and the Baby Boomer Generation). We focus our analysis on seniors living in Germany, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and Ukraine.

This situation reveals self-employment as a good option for becoming re-involved in the working life. In this context, this paper presents a gamified educational platform to empower social economy entrepreneurship skills in long-term unemployed people. In particular, we present the training approach underpinning the motivational process supported by gamification. which has been developed using the ADDIE model. The learning path is developed according to a story that guides the work throughout the training process. It is based on the premises of alignment with reality. instruction from didactic material and real-life stories, in-game practice, work in groups and assistance from a facilitator. This approach covers the competence needs identified in a previous study and includes gamification techniques to improve motivation and engagement. Therefore, the training program comprises: (1) a set of materials and real social economy enterprise experiences, which are the basis for learning and getting inspiration; (2) activities to develop a business plan based on concepts learned from the learning materials and from real-life stories, as well as the help of a facilitator who walks with trainees during the process: (3) a set of individual and group, mandatory and optional assessment activities to evaluate the learning achieved; and (4) a three-views scoring system that shows learning progress for individuals and groups, and gives players the opportunity to exchange gamification points for benefits in the game. The results presented in this paper are based on a sample of two pilots run in Italy and Spain and involving five facilitators working with around 60 learners. About 60% of participants indicated their intention to apply knowledge obtained in a real-life entrepreneurship initiative.","[Padilla-Zea, Natalia; Aceto, Stefania; Burgos, Daniel] Univ Int La Rioja UNIR, Res Inst Innovat & Technol Educ UNIR iTED, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain",Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR),"Burgos, D (corresponding author), Univ Int La Rioja UNIR, Res Inst Innovat & Technol Educ UNIR iTED, Logrono, La Rioja, Spain.",natalia.padilla@unir.net; stefania.aceto@unir.net; daniel.burgos@unir.net,"Burgos, Daniel/AAL-6447-2020; PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012; Padilla Zea, Natalia/AAD-7366-2022","Burgos, Daniel/0000-0003-0498-1101; Padilla Zea, Natalia/0000-0001-6677-0372",project Social Seducement - European Commission under the Erasmus+ Programme [2014-1-UK01-KA200-001830]; Research Institute for Innovation & Technology in Education (UNIR iTED) at Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR),project Social Seducement - European Commission under the Erasmus+ Programme; Research Institute for Innovation & Technology in Education (UNIR iTED) at Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR),"This work is partially supported by the project Social Seducement (contract number: 2014-1-UK01-KA200-001830) funded by the European Commission under the Erasmus+ Programme, and the Research Institute for Innovation & Technology in Education (UNIR iTED) (http://ited.unir.net) at Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (UNIR).",,53,9,9,2,32,UNIV INT RIOJA-UNIR,LOGRONO,"RECTORADO, AVENIDA DE LA PAZ, 137, LOGRONO, 26006, SPAIN",1989-1660,,,INT J INTERACT MULTI,Int.

In this paper, we analyse the CSR activities of the regional co-operatives of the leading Finnish retailer S Group based on annual board reporting. In light of our findings, we argue that no consistently high level of CSR can be identified across the S Group and all its regional co-operatives. Therefore, we do not deem it feasible to conclude that consumer co-operatives are inherently socially responsible organizations merely due to their organization form. Instead, it seems that the fact that the members are in charge in a consumer co-operative and elect a board to oversee it serves to keep the responsibility in the hands of local residents, but at the same time, it also requires a genuine interest towards governance of the co-operative as well as CSR issues. In the absence of either, the level of responsibility is likely to depend on the interest management and board members show in these issues. The paper concludes with practical implications for the S Group and consumer co-operatives in general as well future avenues for research on CSR and consumer co-operatives.","[Javier Perez-Sanz, Francisco; Gargallo-Castel, Ana F.; Luisa Esteban-Salvador, M.] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Humanas, Campus Teruel, Zaragoza, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Pérez-Sanz, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Fac Ciencias Sociales & Humanas, Campus Teruel, Zaragoza, Spain.",fjperez@unizar.es,"Gargallo-Castel, Ana/F-8686-2016; ESTEBAN-SALVADOR, MARIA LUISA/H-3181-2015","Gargallo-Castel, Ana/0000-0001-8054-8997; ESTEBAN-SALVADOR, MARIA LUISA/0000-0001-6511-1893",,,,,128,9,9,10,31,CIRIEC-ESPANA,VALENCIA,"AVE NARANJOS, S-N, EDIF DEP ORIENTAL 2P21, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",0213-8093,1989-6816,,CIRIEC,CIRIEC,NOV,2019,97,,,,,,137,178,,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.97.11043,http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.97.11043,,,42,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,JX0FI,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000503419400005,View Full Record in Web of Science

The stream structure parameters of Suzhou City were analysed to study the evolution and spatial differentiation of a water system undergoing urbanization. The influencing pattern of different urbanization processes on river system structure and hydrological processes was detected by statistical methods and simulation analysis. The results show that urban sprawl is influenced by both the natural environment and the social economy. At different stages of urbanization, the spatial urban expansion and the natural river characteristics influence the evolution of the river network: during rapid urbanization, the decline in surface water ratio and river density is more intense. The decrease of surface water ratio and river density in rapidly urbanized areas was greatest, followed by that in area urbanized in the 1980s, with few changes in the old town. Under high urbanization, river system indicators tend to stabilize. The rivers' hydrological features were affected by urbanization, with water yield in the study area increasing from 0.81 to 0.95 m(3)/m(2) (1991-2015). The same rainfall intensity results in higher flood levels and greater risk of flooding under rapid urbanization.","[Lin, Zhixin; Xu, Youpeng; Dai, Xiaoying; Wang, Qiang; Gao, Bin; Xiang, Jie; Yuan, Jia] Nanjing Univ, Sch Geog & Oceanog Sci, Dept Phys Geog, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Xu, YP (corresponding author), 163 Xianlin Ave, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",xypnju@163.com,"Wang, Qiang/JAX-8454-2023; gao, bin/JYW-5418-2024","Wang, Qiang/0000-0002-7941-880X;",National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0401502]; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Foundation of Jiangsu Province [2015003]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41771032],National Key Research and Development Program of China; Water Conservancy Science and Technology Foundation of Jiangsu Province; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported by the projects of National Key Research and Development Program of China [No. 2016YFC0401502], the Water Conservancy Science and Technology Foundation of Jiangsu Province [No. 2015003], and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [No. 41771032].",,34,9,10,12,47,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0262-6667,2150-3435,,HYDROLOG SCI J,Hydrol.

The importance of ecological security has gained greater prominence. Sustaining or restoring natural functions of water ecosystems is also crucial for human welfare. To assess water related ecological security (WES), this paper constructed a framework based on the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model with indicators in terms of society, economy, water resources, water environment and ecology. The Entropy Method was used to determine the weighting of each indicator. Spatial distribution and temporal trend of WES was then analyzed in China. With weighting analyses, dominant factors threatening eco-security were identified. Results show that the basin of Inland Rivers in the Northwest (IRNW) and the basin of Rivers in the Southwest (RSW) are the most ecologically threatened regions in China. In the IRNW basin, the WES is mostly affected by the factors of water consumption ratio and soil erosion area ratio, while in the RSW basin it was influenced by the natural population increase ratio and the investment percent of GDP in environmental pollution treatment. Most WES indexes (WESIs) in the ten basins show an increasing trend, except for that in the basin of Rivers in Southeast (RSE) which has a decreasing trend due to the reduced investment ratio of environmental pollution treatment. These results will provide valuable information to water resources management.","[Hao, Xiuping; Liu, Changming; Yu, Jingjie] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Changsen] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing Key Lab Urban Hydrol Cycle & Sponge City, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China; [Hao, Xiuping] North China Univ Water Resources & Elect Power, Zhengzhou 450011, Henan, Peoples R China; [Hao, Xiuping; Liu, Changming] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Changsen] CNRS UMR 7357, ICube, UdS, 300 Bld Sebastien Brant,CS 10413, F-67412 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France; [Mitrovic, Simon M.] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Sci, Sch Environm, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Beijing Normal University; North China University of Water Resources & Electric Power; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; University of Technology Sydney","Zhao, CS (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Beijing Key Lab Urban Hydrol Cycle & Sponge City, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.;Zhao, CS (corresponding author), CNRS UMR 7357, ICube, UdS, 300 Bld Sebastien Brant,CS 10413, F-67412 Illkirch Graffenstaden, France.",hzjohnson@gmail.com,"Zhao, Changsen/C-8107-2011; Liu, Chang/ISV-3950-2023; Mitrovic, Simon M/A-7225-2012","Mitrovic, Simon/0000-0002-5528-2215","National Natural Science Foundation [41330529]; State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, China [14RC-09]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University [2013NT07]; Education Department of Shaanxi Province [12JS068]","National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University; Education Department of Shaanxi Province","This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation (No.41330529, the Young-people-cultivation Project of State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, China (No.14RC-09), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University (No.2013NT07), Project of the Education Department of Shaanxi Province (No. 12JS068).

Climate-sensitive events have already been critical obstacles of poverty reduction and sustainable economic development. Assessing how climate change affects poverty reduction is of great significance to the comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts on social economy and mitigation of its negative impacts. With geo-spatially referenced malnutrition and infant mortality data as a proxy for poverty, focusing on the aspects of agriculture and human well-being that consist of physical health and personal autonomy. This study selects three countries, China, India and Senegal, to investigate the impacts of climate change on poverty reduction. Contrast to previous work when analyze climate changes' impacts most concentrated on coastal urban areas, this paper is focused more on the rural poor areas and conduct a contrastive analysis of different income groups of countries. The correlation analysis results show the same is that the indicators of climate change are in significant correlations with indicators of poverty and that of agriculture and human well-being in China, India and Senegal. However, China performs poorly in terms of personal autonomy, while Senegal performs well, the correlations of forest area percentage (one indicator of climate change) with other variables in Senegal are absolutely opposite to that in China and India. We find the same influence factors have different effects on poverty reduction in these countries, the anti-poverty policies should be made according to local conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

KEYNES; MONEY; EMPLOYMENT; POLICY; CURRENCY,"In recent years negative nominal interest rates came to the attention of a wider audience as one instrument to overcome the lower zero bound to conventional monetary policy. Modern proponents trace the origin of the proposal back to Silvio Gesell, a largely forgotten German autodidactic scholar of the interwar period, whose work provides valuable insight into heterodox late nineteenth- and twentieth-century economic thinking. Against this backdrop, the present article provides a comprehensive review of Gesell's life and social economy, firmly linking him to German anarchism of the interwar period. It suggests that Gesell not only provided a monetary theory of interest, but put forward an independent monetary theory of economic crisis that is essential in understanding the historical origins of depreciative currency proposals. Moreover, the article maintains that Gesell's monetary theory of interest can be seen as the missing link between heterodox economics, The General Theory, and anarchist economic theory.","[Ilgmann, Cordelius] Thuringian Minist Econ Affairs Sci & Digital Soc, Erfurt, Germany",,"Ilgmann, C (corresponding author), Thuringian Minist Econ Affairs Sci & Digital Soc, Erfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,98,9,10,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

By using the methodology, service demands in all sectors were estimated based on social-economic data, and then the best technology and energy mixes were obtained to meet the service demands. The methodology was applied to Japan toward zero-carbon energy system out to the year of 2100, and three different scenarios of nuclear power development are considered in light of the Fukushima accident: (i) no further introduction of nuclear, (ii) fixed portion and (iii) no limit of nuclear. The results show that, zero-carbon energy scenario can be attained in the year 2100 when electricity will supply 75% of total energy consumption, and three power generation scenarios were proposed, 30% renewable and 70% gas-carbon capture and storage (CCS) in Scenario 1, respective one-third nuclear, renewable and gas-CCS in Scenario 2, and 60% nuclear power, 20% renewable and 10% gas-CCS in Scenario 3. Finally, Scenario 2 is rated as the most balanced scenario by putting emphasis on the availability of diversified power source, considering the inter-comparison of the three scenarios from the four aspects of cost, CO2 emission, risk and diversity.

These injuries have a profound impact on patient's quality of life and pose a burden on social economy. The aims of the current study were to report about the initial management of isolated traumatic major upper limb amputation from the time of admission to definitive soft tissue closure and to establish a distinct initial management algorithm. METHODS: We recorded data concerning the initial management of the patient and the amputated body part in the emergency department (ED) (time from admission to the operation, Injury Severity Score [ISS], cold ischemia time from injury to ED, and total cold ischemia time). The duration, amount of surgical procedures, the time to definitive soft tissue coverage, and the choice of flap were part of the documentation. All intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded. RESULTS: All patients were successfully replanted (time from injury to ED, 59 +/- 4 minutes; ISS16; time from admission to operating room 57 +/- 10 minutes; total cold ischemia time 203 +/- 20 minutes; total number of procedures 7.3 +/- 2.5); definitive soft tissue coverage could be achieved 23 +/- 14 days after injury. Two thromboembolic complications occurred, which could be treated by embolectomy during revision surgery, and we saw one early infection, which could be successfully managed by serial de-bridements in our series. CONCLUSION: The management of complete major amputations of the upper extremity should be reserved for large trauma centers with enough resources concerning technical, structural, and personnel infrastructure to meet the demands of surgical reconstruction as well as the postoperative care. Following a distinct treatment algorithm is mandatory to increase the rate of successful major replantations, thus laying the foundation for promising secondary functional reconstructive efforts.

This paper set up a set of index system and model methods for the assessment of the coordination between population and resources, environment and social-economic development, and it quantitatively evaluated this coordination at the provincial scale in 2000 and 2010 respectively. Based on this set of index system, the suitability degree and the spatial-temporal pattern of population distribution at the provincial scale were carefully characterized. The restriction of population distribution at the provincial scale was graded and classified, and the coordinated development strategy of population, resources, environment and social economy was finally put forward. The results showed that: (1) The environmental suitability of population distribution at the provincial scale was generally high in China, which tended to be stable from 2000 to 2010. (2) The restriction of water and land resources at the provincial scale was generally strong in China, but it tended to be weak from 2000 to 2010. (3) The coordination degree between the social-economic development and population distribution at the provincial scale was mostly at a middle level, which was in the positive upward path from 2000 to 2010. (4) The suitability of population distribution at the provincial scale was mostly at a middle level, all of which was rising from 2000 to 2010. (5) The coordination degree between population distribution and resources, environment and social-economic development at the provincial scale was divided into four grades, including basic coordination, relative coordination, awaited coordination and urgent-needed coordination. (6) The basic ways to promote the coordinated development of population, resources and environment in different regions in China can be summarized as: implementing the strategy of population agglomeration and evacuation, guiding the orderly flow of population, optimizing the spatial distribution of population and drawing up the spatial planning of population development.","[Yang Yanzhao; Feng Zhiming; Wang Lu; You Zhen] Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Wang Lu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Feng, ZM (corresponding author), Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",yangyz@igsnrr.ac.cn; fengzm@igsnrr.ac.cn; youz@igsnrr.ac.cn,"WANG, HUI/JFA-9683-2023",,"Key Laboratory of Carrying Capacity Assessment for Resource and Environment, Ministry of Land and Resources; Science and technology foundation project [2011FY110400]","Key Laboratory of Carrying Capacity Assessment for Resource and Environment, Ministry of Land and Resources; Science and technology foundation project","Foundation: Key Laboratory of Carrying Capacity Assessment for Resource and Environment, Ministry of Land and Resources; Science and technology foundation project, No.2011FY110400",,25,9,11,2,45,SCIENCE PRESS,BEIJING,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",1009-637X,1861-9568,,J GEOGR SCI,J.

My ethnographic landscape is Sultanpur, a Muslim-dominated ghetto in the northern quarters of Hyderabad, which has been marked by decades of hostilities between local Hindus and Muslims. These tensions had everyday and extreme manifestations (ranging from quotidian expressions of symbolic violence to rioting, looting and bomb blasts) which increased the vulnerabilities of Muslim male children in the slums; the latter being humiliated by ordinary passers-by in times of peace, and at other times being attacked by rioting mobs. To counter their victimhood and organise their own retribution, sections of local boys in Sultanpur, aged between 9 and 14 years, co-ordinated themselves into child squads (bacchon ke fauj). These child vigilantes patrolled the slum borders and common public places, constantly establishing a disciplinary control over fragile aspects of ghetto life. For example, the male child squads not only aggressively prevented members of other communities from entering the slum, they also monitored the movement of Sultanpur-wallahs, often physically assaulting local women who were caught having affairs with Hindu men. In my paper I show how the power, presence and practices of these child squads upturned traditional structures of male and female authority, contested conventional notions of male childhood in a volatile urban space, and sustained nascent masculinities within the moral and social economy of impoverished Muslim male children.","Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Sen, A (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",,,,,,,,47,9,9,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0085-6401,1479-0270,,S ASIA,S.

After the fall of the communist regime and after over 50 years of state ownership, the forests and pasture commons (obsti and composeorate) returned to be private property of newly established associative forms. This paper aims to identify and define the contemporary Romanian commons by reference to the general characteristics of social economy organizations. In order to achieve this and obtain a clearer view of the place of the commons in Romania's organizational environment, presentation of some elements of the commons' institutionalization process after the fall of the communist regime is included. The data used for answering these two objectives comes from the analysis of a database comprising 328 questionnaires applied to board members of commons in Romania and various legal documents. The main argument of the paper is that the restitution process that led to the re-establishment of the Romanian commons from public property to common private property-marked by hardships, conflicts, misunderstandings or faults-deepened the scarce knowledge of the political actors, general public and other stakeholders in regard to these organizations and perpetuated their unclear position in the organizational field.","[Opincaru, Irina-Sinziana] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Opincaru, IS (corresponding author), Univ Bucharest, Doctoral Sch Sociol, Bucharest, Romania.",irina.opincaru@sas.unibuc.ro,,,"Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-2865]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI))","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research and Innovation, CNCS-UEFISCDI, Grant/Award Number: PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-2865",,39,8,8,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1370-4788,1467-8292,,ANN PUBLIC COOP ECON,Ann.

Social questions as food sovereignty, right to food, gender equality or small productions viability must be addressed and evaluated, among other reasons, because of their current importance in the political agendas of organisms such as the FAO or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These institutions have been warning for decades about the social and environmental need of turning the goal of food sovereignty into reality. The concept of Food Sovereignty was defined in 1996 during the FAO Summit on the Right to Food in Rome. There, the Via Campesina movement defined Food Sovereignty as a social and political concept essential to build bridges between the agroecological and social and solidarity economy perspectives. This movement referred to the sovereignty of communities, peoples and consumers in order to decide what to eat, what to produce and how the territorial development must be according to its limitations and endogenous characteristics. This concept proposed a higher visibility for the peasant movement, taking into consideration the lack of attention paid as an intermediary agent in international forums and decision-making spaces on the World Trade Organisation or the development policies of other international institutions. With the proposal of an agenda focused on concepts (endogenous development, Food Sovereignty), we need located agri-food systems which work from the logics of community economies, social-solidarity economies and caring economies. We consider that our monitoring and researching projects must reflect this need of theoretical and methodological frames. These ones combine inputs from different fields of social and environmental sustainability. Because of these reasons, this paper aims to understand how the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) as well as the Agroecology can contribute to the economic, social, ecological and political sustainability of family agriculture in Brazil. For this purpose, the dimensions and different ways for viability of selected family exploitations will be exposed. The study is about collecting how the ESS and the Agroecology dialogue on many factors related to sustainability in the production system and peasants' organisation. One of the commonest problems of many SSE experiences is how environmental protection remains at a second stage, if compared to democracy or redistribution issues. Therefore, by adopting Agroecology, the current agroecosystems artificialisation model could be changed. This system would be more suitable for social and ecological reproduction through new proposals of technical, ecological, agronomical and social production. Via this production, a sustainable management of natural resources could be achieved avoiding degradation of the environment. Another question to deal in this paper is the role developed by the short circuits of commercialisation in the promotion of agroecological strategies conceived at the same time as an answer from the perspective of social and solidarity economy. Short circuits of commercialisation are essential elements, especially for peasants and for the endogenous rural development, in order to link again production and consumption to principles of proximity, reliance, and sustainability. The adoption of short circuits as a strategy for territory sovereignty and a defence is a way of guaranteeing the economic aspects as well as the social ones in Agroecology. Our case studies are based in representative experiences of different ways of commercialisation in the Northern and Southern regions of Brazil: Associacao dos Agricultores Ecologistas de Ipe y Antonio Prado (Ecologist Farmers Association of Ipe and Antonio Prado, AECIA) and the Cooperativa de Irituia (Cooperative of Irituia). The AECIA is in the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul, Northeast region, in the municipalities of Antonio Prado and Ipe. These present an intermediate level of capitalisation, where the production systems integrate vegetal and animal productions, outlining the conventional and ecological fruticulture (grape, apple, peach), ecological horticulture, dairy cattle, marking livestock, pigs, birds and corn. The Cooperative of Irituia is in the Northern region of Brazil, province of Para, municipality of Irituia, in the Northeast mesoregion. Its population mainly lives in the rural environment. Its local economy, which is based in agriculture and wood extraction and transformation, is mainly composed of family peasants that practice subsistence farming. Both belong to the tradition of family agriculture in Brazil, but they present a different approach in their ecological, community or economic perspective where they interact. Regarding the method for the case study, we have applied a qualitative approach through several social research techniques, some of them are explicative (interviews, experts panel) , other are more inductive (survey based in three dimensions: Agroecology, New Commons and SSE) and other are more descriptive (secondary sources, interviews to key informers). With all this material, we have made a proposal of social-economic, social-cultural and productive sustainable indicators. In this way, we can test the sustainability approach of these initiatives in the long term. Results of the research point to the existence of differences between the analysed cooperatives regarding productive, social, political and economic viability, not only from the SSE but also the Agroecology. Because of this, the AECIA offers better values in all the studied items instead of the Cooperative of Irituia. At a theoretical level, this work demonstrates a more complex approach to the short circuits in the agri-food channels. Furthermore, from a common agroecological and SSE point of view, those are introduced as an umbrella for democratisation of our agri-food systems, meanwhile defending the right to food as well as a sustainable and healthful production suitable to the physical and cultural context","[Schwab do Nascimento, Fabio] Inst Fed Para, Luziania, Go, Brazil; [Schwab do Nascimento, Fabio; Munoz Benito, Rocio] Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain; [Calle-Collado, Angel] Univ Cordoba, ISEC, Cordoba, Spain",Instituto Federal do Para; Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad de Cordoba,"do Nascimento, FS (corresponding author), Inst Fed Para, Luziania, Go, Brazil.;do Nascimento, FS (corresponding author), Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain.",Z32scnaf@uco.es; Angel.Collado@uco.es; dt1muber@uco.es,"Muñoz Benito, Rocío/AAH-2755-2022; Nascimento, Fabio Schwab do/W-5889-2018; Muñoz Benito, Rocío/AFM-0429-2022","Muñoz Benito, Rocío/0000-0003-0201-6260; Muñoz Benito, Rocío/0000-0003-0201-6260; Calle Collado, Angel/0000-0002-8359-5155",,,,,53,8,8,13,93,CIRIEC-ESPANA,VALENCIA,"AVE NARANJOS, S-N, EDIF DEP ORIENTAL 2P21, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",0213-8093,1989-6816,,CIRIEC,CIRIEC,MAR,2020,98,,,,,,189,211,,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.98.14161,http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.98.14161,,,23,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,KZ6IC,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000523362600007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, to objectively expound the uncertainty of a drought risk system, the precondition cloud and maximum entropy principle coupling model (PCMEP) for drought risk assessment is proposed, which utilizes the principle of maximum entropy to estimate the probability distribution of cloud drops, and the two-dimensional precondition cloud algorithm to determine the certainty degree of drought risk. Moreover, the established PCMEP model is further applied in a drought risk assessment study in Kunming city covering 1956-2011, and the results indicate that (1) the probability of drought events for different levels exhibits a slight increasing trend among the 56 historical years; and (2) both the integrated certainty degree and its component of drought risk are more evident, which will be more beneficial to determine the drought risk level. In general, the proposed PCMEP model provides a new reliable idea to evaluate the comprehensive risk level of drought from a more objective and systematic perspective.","[Bai, Xia; Wang, Yimin] Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Base Ecohydraul Engn Arid Area, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Bai, Xia; Qi, Xiaoming] Bengbu Univ, Sch Mech & Vehicle Engn, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China; [Jin, Juliang; Wu, Chengguo] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Civil Engn, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China",Xi'an University of Technology; Bengbu University; Hefei University of Technology,"Wang, YM (corresponding author), Xian Univ Technol, State Key Lab Base Ecohydraul Engn Arid Area, Xian 710048, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",baixia0516@163.com; wangyimin@xaut.edu.cn; JINJL66@126.com; xmqi2018@outlook.com; wule9825@163.com,"Liu, Chang/ISV-3950-2023; Liu, Kai/IST-6808-2023",,"National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFC0400900, 2016YFC0401305, 2016YFC0401303]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [51479045, 51579059]; University Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province [113052015KJ04]",National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); University Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province),"This research was funded by National Key Research and Development Program of China with Grant No. 2016YFC0400900, 2016YFC0401305 and 2016YFC0401303, the National Natural Science Foundation of China with Grant No. 51479045 and 51579059), and the University Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Province with Grant No. 113052015KJ04.",,29,8,8,2,39,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,SEP,2018,10,9,,,,,,,3236,10.3390/su10093236,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10093236,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,GW3DA,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000446770200279,View Full Record in Web of Science

Taking these two aspects together, the top echelons of the financial city network can be regarded as potential national or regional financial centers. Furthermore, by means of a panel data regression analysis, determining factors of financial city network evolution are explored from perspectives of location, institution, and social-economy. We find that most cities have witnessed significant changes in city position, especially in terms of external financial resources attraction, and the influencing factors of financial development vary by region due to the disparities in regional financial development environments.","[Zhao, Jinli; Zhang, Xuebo; Song, Jinping] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xuebo] Zaozhuang Univ, Sch Tourism & Resource Environm, Zaozhuang, Shandong, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Zaozhuang University,"Zhao, JL (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Geog, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhaojinli302@126.com; xuebozhang@126.com; songjp@bnu.edu.cn,"Song, Jin/HHS-8731-2022",,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41271132],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grant 41271132.,,58,8,9,1,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0017-4815,1468-2257,,GROWTH CHANGE,Growth Change,SEP,2018,49,3,,,,,490,511,,10.1111/grow.12244,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/grow.12244,,,22,Development Studies; Regional & Urban Planning,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies; Public Administration,GS8EN,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000443940800005,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, like banks and savings banks, they have to be as efficient and competitive as possible to survive in today's business environment, especially at times of crisis. To date, there have been very few studies on their efficiency and practically none for the crisis period. Moreover, almost all the existing studies assess only financial efficiency, without considering their social function. This study examines the levels of both financial and social efficiency in Spanish credit unions as well as their main determinants during the recent crisis. We apply the two-stage double bootstrap data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodology based on panel data corresponding to all the credit unions active in Spain between 2008 and 2013. The empirical results indicate that financial and social efficiency achieved an acceptable level, although on average the former was slightly greater than the latter. We also find that both age and merger and acquisition activity were positively influential on the financial efficiency of credit unions but had a significant negative effect on their social efficiency. Moreover, the regional location of such entities and the financial crisis were also crucial determinants of both types of efficiency. Our findings are therefore useful for all the stakeholders of credit unions to know if these entities have been efficient according to a double bottom line accounting in the crisis period and hence to maintain successful social management that is compatible with satisfactory financial efficiency.","[Martinez-Campillo, Almudena; Fernandez-Santos, Yolanda; del Pilar Sierra-Fernandez, Maria] Univ Leon, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Campus Vegazana S-N, E-24071 Leon, Spain",Universidad de Leon,"Martínez-Campillo, A (corresponding author), Univ Leon, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Campus Vegazana S-N, E-24071 Leon, Spain.",amarc@unileon.es,"Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/G-8575-2015; Fernández-Santos, Yolanda/L-8070-2016","Sierra-Fernandez, Pilar/0000-0001-5598-8819; Martinez-Campillo, Almudena/0000-0002-3313-529X; Fernandez-Santos, Yolanda/0000-0003-1392-3130",,,,,63,8,12,3,35,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0167-4544,1573-0697,,J BUS ETHICS,J.

This paper provides a political and geospatial analysis of regional inequality across the province from 1990-2015 under a comparative spatiotemporal conceptual framework. Great differences in terms of the distribution and dynamic changes in primary school were found between southern and the northern Ningxia. The southern region has a large number of primary schools with a sharp reduction in these numbers, especially in recent years, while the north has a small but stable number of schools. Spatial accessibility analyses revealed that due to the imbalance between the south and the north, the spatial accessibility of the southern region is much worse than that of the northern region. Our study found the imbalance in the number and spatial distribution of primary schools in the north and south of Ningxia was formed because of multiple factors of policy, geography, and social-economy. The government has pursued a policy of promoting education fairness. However, neglecting differences between north and south, on the contrary, has brought negative effects to the south, worsened the educational environment, and increased education inequities. Our case study in the Ningxia district demonstrates that this research can provide a practical basis for the formulation of policies to guide the rational planning of primary education in Ningxia and/or other similar areas.","[Wan, Jiali; Liu, Yanfang; Chen, Yiyun; Hu, Jiameng; Wang, Zhengyu] Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Liu, Yanfang] Wuhan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geog Informat Syst, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Liu, YF; Chen, YY (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch Resource & Environm Sci, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.;Liu, YF (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Geog Informat Syst, Wuhan 430079, Hubei, Peoples R China.",wanjiali_whu@163.com; yfliu6106@163.com; chenyy@whu.edu.cn; hujiameng@whu.edu.cn; wangzhenyu@whu.edu.cn,"CHEN, YIYUN/AAD-9501-2019","Chen, Yiyun/0000-0002-7442-3239; wan, jiali/0000-0002-8790-4031",National Key Research and Development Program [2017YFB0503505]; National Natural Science Foundation [41771432],National Key Research and Development Program; National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was financially supported by the National Key Research and Development Program (Grant No.: 2017YFB0503505) and National Natural Science Foundation (No. 41771432).,,62,8,8,3,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,FEB,2018,10,2,,,,,,,559,10.3390/su10020559,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10020559,,,16,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,FX3BB,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000425943100282,View Full Record in Web of Science

Yet commitment to a project on which an employee might be working is largely unknown. Additional complications arise when the project makes use of volunteers who donate their time for reasons other than pecuniary reward. The relationships between volunteers, organizations, and projects represent a gap in the field of organizational commitment knowledge. This paper identifies from literature the values that inform and influence volunteer commitment levels. Known antecedents of commitment are developed to present a model which encapsulates the variables that should be recognized as influencing volunteer commitment levels within a project context. The paper proposes a conceptual model of volunteer commitment to a project using three categories of commitment: emotional, purposeful and contextual, and concludes that the next phase of the study will test this model and develop a tool that will enable the measurement of volunteer commitment in a project context.","[Chabanet, Didier] IDRAC Lyon & Triangle, UMR 5206, Lyon, France; [Chabanet, Didier] Sci Po, CEVIPOF, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Institut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite (INRETS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Paris-VIII; Universite Paul-Valery; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Chabanet, D (corresponding author), IDRAC Lyon & Triangle, UMR 5206, Lyon, France.;Chabanet, D (corresponding author), Sci Po, CEVIPOF, Paris, France.",didierchabanet@hotmail.com,"CHABANET, Didier/HGU-4791-2022",,,,,,49,8,9,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0957-8765,1573-7888,,VOLUNTAS,Voluntas,DEC,2017,28,6,,,,,2360,2382,,10.1007/s11266-016-9822-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11266-016-9822-0,,,23,Social Issues,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Social Issues,FO5BQ,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000416864500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Orbán, A",,,,"Orban, Annamaria",,,Building smart communities in the Hungarian social economy,COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CIVIL-SOCIETY; INNOVATION; MONEY,"We are living in an increasingly interdependent and crisis hit globalized world, not least in Europe, including Central and Eastern Europe. Many Hungarian local communities feel that they lost rather than gained from the political transition of the early nineties and the socio-economic development in Hungary over the last twenty-five years, as the country has opened up to globalization and joined European Union integration processes. These people are marginalized and lack both material and non-material stability due to unemployment, the erosion of social ties and scarcity of resources. In this research article, our first assumption is that there is a way out of this desperate situation even for local communities living in the poorest, most neglected rural or urban areas. Escaping the poverty trap requires creative and innovative self-help, trust and solidarity to be sustainable in the long term. The second assumption is that some self-help communities can successfully be maintained largely in cities (by means of 'favour' or time banks), while others (using micro-credit or self-sustaining community models) can effectively operate only in rural areas, which can then be followed by other communities as models of best practice. Looking beyond these differences, the common feature of these community-based models is that they represent forms of social or solidarity economy. To build up and then sustain these models in the long run, the local community, and especially their leaders, should be supported by high levels of social capital, most importantly trust, as the quintessential element of social capital.","[Orban, Annamaria] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Sociol & Commun, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Orbán, A (corresponding author), Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Sociol & Commun, H-1111 Budapest, Hungary.",aorban@eik.bme.hu,,,,,,,20,8,8,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0010-3802,1468-2656,,COMMUNITY DEV J,Community Dev.

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the role that online accessibility (which is understood to be a tool to implement transparency) has in raising financial resources and to assess its impact on economic and social achievements. Moreover, the authors study the interaction between online accessibility and external verification. Design/methodology/approach - This study analyzes the behavior of 1,400 SEOs between 2009 and 2012 using a structural equation model and the MPLUS 7.4 software, which is based on covariance analysis. Findings - The results show that transparency, which is understood as online accessibility, assists in raising financial resources and enhances SEO economic and social achievements. The authors also note that external verifications favor the economic achievements of SEOs but do not improve their social achievements. Research limitations/implications - This research has two limitations: this study refers only to Spanish SEOs and no consensus exists on how to measure economic and social performance. Therefore, the conclusions should be considered with caution in other regulatory and cultural fields. The main implications of this work are the criteria the authors provide to help decision makers decide on the transparency model that SEOs should develop according to their management needs. Originality/value - This study bridges a gap in the current research by increasing understanding of the role of accessibility as being themost important tool for an organization that strives to embody transparent behavior.","[Jose Lopez-Arceiz, Francisco; Bellostas Perezgrueso, Ana Jose] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Aragon, Spain; [Rivera Torres, Maria Pilar] Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Mkt Management & Market Res, Aragon, Spain",University of Zaragoza; University of Zaragoza,"Pérezgrueso, AJB (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Accounting & Finance, Aragon, Spain.",bellosta@unizar.es,"RIVERA-TORRES, PILAR/K-8088-2017; López-Arceiz, Francisco J./E-4455-2018; Bellostas, Ana/H-3135-2015","RIVERA-TORRES, PILAR/0000-0001-9319-5895; López-Arceiz, Francisco J./0000-0001-8790-3840; Bellostas, Ana/0000-0002-0249-1160",,,,,98,8,14,3,17,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1468-4527,1468-4535,,ONLINE INFORM REV,Online Inf.

As an important tool of predicting and preventing these problems, water-environmental risk assessment (WERA) plays an increasingly important role in environment management. This study mainly targets the surface water environment and takes the BTH region as a study area in developing a water-environmental risk assessment index system based on the Driving force-Pressures-States-Impacts-Responses model. The weighting, risk, and zoning of each index are determined using multiple methods such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and geographic information system technology. Further discussions are made to analyze the leading factors of high-risk units, the relationship between the risk level and social economy, and the uncertainty of WERA. Generally speaking, results show that the relative high-risk areas mainly distribute in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and Tangshan, and the relative low-risk areas mainly distribute in Chengde and Zhangjiakou. The remaining parts of the region are at the middle-risk level. The results also show a positive correlation between the risk level and the social economy. This study gathered lots of data and carried out a number of calculation work, and is expected to improve the WERA methods and help managers set the priorities for local water-environmental management and make more effective decisions in the context of BTH collaborative development.","[Leng, Suya; Zhai, Yuanzheng; Jiang, Shijie; Lei, Yan; Wang, Jinsheng] Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Minist Educ China, Engn Res Ctr Groundwater Pollut Control & Remedia, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Zhai, YZ (corresponding author), Beijing Normal Univ, Coll Water Sci, Minist Educ China, Engn Res Ctr Groundwater Pollut Control & Remedia, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",diszyz@163.com,"Jiang, Shijie/G-6994-2019; Jiang, Shijie/AAP-9862-2020","Jiang, Shijie/0000-0002-2808-9559",CRSRI Open Research Program [CKWV2015235/KY]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41302179]; Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment [2014ZX07201-010],CRSRI Open Research Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment,"This work was funded by the CRSRI Open Research Program(CKWV2015235/KY) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41302179).

However, with the rapid development of the social economy, many nature reserves are facing enormous pressures from human activities. The assessment of the sustainability of nature reserves is a fundamental task for the planning and management of such areas. In this study, the sustainability of China's 319 national nature reserves (NRRs) was evaluated based on an ecological footprint (EF) method. The results indicated that the per capita ecological footprints of all national nature reserves increased 85.86% from 2000 to 2010. Meanwhile, the per capita biocapacity (BC) of all national nature reserves increased slightly, with a rate of increase of 1.79%. The ` traffic light' method was adopted to identify the sustainability status of those national nature reserves. It was found that currently (2010) 45% of NRRs were in the condition of ecological deficit. In terms of dynamic changes in EF and BC, only 16% of NRRs were sustainable. The 124 national nature reserves that were in the red light state were mainly distributed in Anhui Province, Chongqing City, Hunan, Guizhou, Fujian, Shandong Province, and Inner Mongolia. The percentage of nature reserves at the red light state in these areas were 83.3%, 66.7%, 64.7%, 62.5%, 58.3%, 57.1%, and 56.5%, respectively. The reserves in the red light state should be included in the priority concern level and should be strictly controlled in terms of population growth and the intensity of exploitation. The results of this study will provide more effective data for reference and for decision making support in nature reserve protection.","[Liu, Xiaoman; Wang, Qiao; Liu, Huiming; Li, Jin; Fu, Zhuo] Minist Environm Protect, Satellite Environm Applicat Ctr, Beijing 100094, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Dong] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Dong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Jiang, D (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.;Jiang, D (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",liuxm@secmep.cn; jiangd@igsnrr.ac.cn; wangqiao@sepa.gov.cn; liuhm@secmep.cn; lij@secmep.cn; fuz@secmep.cn,"Liu, Xiaoman/J-2142-2015","Liu, Xiaoman/0000-0002-8978-5937",Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2016YFC1201300]; Ministry of Environmental Protection of China,"Ministry of Science and Technology of China(Ministry of Science and Technology, China); Ministry of Environmental Protection of China",This research was supported and funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2016YFC1201300) and the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China.

The policy will benefit the social economy of the local farmers and communities and create a variety of jobs. Attempts in fulfilling demand should uphold production sustainability, even then many indication show declining capability of soil to have increased. Reducing the capability of soil may lead to the reducing of productivity. Many well-documented data show that using organic fertilizer such as manure might improve soil's biological properties as well as its nutrition, production and quality of the obtained maize. Nevertheless, these improvements depend on the chemical composition of the green manures applied to the soil. Manures have different varieties in its chemical composition of nutrition, and heavy metal content depending on the diet. Little attention has been given by farmers on the probability of their plants might be contaminated by lead. Lead has been known to have a detrimental effect on plants. Therefore monitoring the effect is needed. The research was dedicated to participate on the effort of increasing productivity by promoting manure usage such as goat and cow manure on growing maize. Different compositions of goat and cow manure were applied on the soil media growth of maize on the glasshouse. The growth was monitored biophysically by measuring the leaves surface electrical difference and area and observing for signs of chlorosis. Result has shown that the addition of manure on soil has increases leaf area and electrical potential difference compared to the maize grown in a mere soil media. It is concluded that renewable fertilizer such as cow and goat manure was important in increasing plant growth. A composition of 2/3 soil and 1/3 goat manure was optimal for the leaves growth followed by composition of 2/3 soil and 1/3 cow manure. No signs of stress symptoms such as chlorosis were found; meaning that on all compositions of manure used in the research might be safe for plant and soil and pose no threat for human safety. Further monitoring is needed to ensure no lead contamination.

It examines the calamitous role of financial innovation in the global financial crisis, developing a non-rational theorization of finance within the social economy that factors in the role of affect. Outlining the foundations for such an approach, the analysis draws on Thorstein Veblen and Georges Bataille, whose work encompasses psycho-social conceptions of political-economic agency. From the more anthropological lens of Veblen and Bataille's theorizations, it is possible to move beyond instrumentalist accounts of financial innovation premised on pecuniary expedients and aspirations of market completion. As we argue, in a broader affective economy, contemporary financial innovation serves invidious ends, providing a means of attaining social distinction, constituting a medium for violent expenditure and bestowing access to sovereign expression on its purveyors. Highlighting the non-rational dimension of financial markets prompts a reconsideration of the nature of crisis and the means of its redress.","[Gammon, Earl] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Wigan, Duncan] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Sussex; Copenhagen Business School,"Gammon, E (corresponding author), Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",e.gammon@sussex.ac.uk,,,,,,,79,8,8,4,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0263-2764,1460-3616,,THEOR CULT SOC,Theory Cult.

The analysis of the documentation published on this subject is far from exhaustive. These works are also partially biased, and tend to base their analyses of care from a gender perspective in developing countries on certain conceptual and theoretical works on care which take as their point of reference the capitalist economies in developed countries. The analysis presented in this article therefore endeavours to go beyond economicist interpretations of development by introducing the gender perspective, and seeks to quantify unpaid care work in relation to gender equality. The aim of this research work is to contribute empirical evidence on the reproduction of gender inequality in the context of developing countries in the light of feminist theories by going beyond economicist approaches to economic and social development. The analysis essentially involves measuring the amount of paid and unpaid work done by women as compared to men using secondary data from different statistical sources compiled by the project carried out by the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) on Political and Social Economy of Care. Thus, the basic objective of this work is to provide empirical evidence to highlight the importance of care in achieving gender equality, by developing social and gender policies designed to neutralise these inequalities and thereby to advance the construction of a social and democratic citizenship with no gender distinctions, in the context of developing countries.","Univ Valladolid, Dept Sociol & Social Work, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid,"Mínguez, AM (corresponding author), Univ Valladolid, Dept Sociol & Social Work, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain.",,,,,,,,90,8,15,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1464-9934,1477-027X,,PROG DEV STUD,Prog.

Thus, it is significant to carry out integrative evaluation on NPS pollution loading from soil erosion. Pollutants nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) were chosen as assessment indices, and the method of export coefficient model was adopted for statistical calculation of the pollutants loading distribution across the country. The results showed that the total NPS pollution loading in 2007 achieved 2.44 x 10(10)kg in the country, of which COD contributed the largest proportion (83.3%), followed by total N and P. There were huge differences existed on the 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Spatial variability of pollutants loading and intensity was caused by many influencing factors including regional social economy levels, agriculture conservation practices, climate, hydrological factors and so on. Our study showed that it was much more rigorous in the west than in the east of China, especially in the northwestern Loess Plateau. This study is the first national scale evaluation of the main non-point source pollution loads, and provides some references on environmental protection and sustainable development.","[Lv, Xizhi; Yu, Xinxiao; Fan, Dengxing; Li, Qingyun] Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Com, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Yu, XX (corresponding author), Beijing Forestry Univ, Coll Soil & Water Conservat, Key Lab Soil & Water Conservat & Desertificat Com, Minist Educ, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",yuxinxiao111@126.com,,"Lv, Xizhi/0000-0003-1598-1414",Forestry Public Welfare Project of China [201104005]; Projects in the National Science & Technology Pillar Program [2011BAD38B05]; CFERNGENE,Forestry Public Welfare Project of China; Projects in the National Science & Technology Pillar Program; CFERNGENE,"This work is financially supported by the Forestry Public Welfare Project of China (No.201104005), the Projects in the National Science & Technology Pillar Program during the Twelve Five-Year Plan Period (No. 2011BAD38B05) and CFERN&GENE Award Funds on Ecological Paper.

Cardiac embolism is due to thrombus formation mainly in the left atrial appendage (LAA). The pathophysiology leading to increased thrombogenicity is complex and requires a remodelling of the LAA structure, decreased LAA blood flow, activation of inflammatory processes, deviations of the hemostatic/fibrinolytic system, and activation/dysfunction of endothelial/endocardial cells. Altogether, a prothrombotic state proposed by Virchow more than 150 years ago. The presence of a LAA thrombus, therefore, is a result of a dynamic process of clot formation and lysis. A comprehensive understanding of this pathophysiology is helpful to optimize the management of patients at high risk of cardioembolic stroke. Especially those with contraindications for oral anticoagulation are in a need of an alternative approach that is not associated with a long-term risk of hemorrhage and other attendant circumstances. The reasonable alternative may be the exclusion of the LAA cavity from circulation by either surgical or percutaneous catheter-based procedures.","[Leithaeuser, Boris; Park, Jai-Wun] Asklepios Klin Harburg, Dept Med 1, D-21075 Hamburg, Germany; [Jung, Friedrich] GKSS Res Ctr GmbH, Ctr Biomat Dev, Teltow, Germany; [Jung, Friedrich] GKSS Res Ctr GmbH, Berlin Brandenburg Ctr Regenerat Therapies BCRT, Polymer Res Inst, Teltow, Germany",Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon,"Leithäuser, B (corresponding author), Asklepios Klin Harburg, Dept Med 1, Eissendorfer Pferdeweg 52, D-21075 Hamburg, Germany.",b.leithaeuser@asklepios.com,"Jung, Friedrich/L-1301-2013","Jung, Friedrich/0000-0001-8098-7180",,,,,130,8,13,0,7,IOS PRESS,AMSTERDAM,"NIEUWE HEMWEG 6B, 1013 BG AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1386-0291,1875-8622,,CLIN HEMORHEOL MICRO,Clin.

Informal and organized community recycling create social, economic and environmental benefits. Inclusive door-to-door recycling builds awareness for responsible consumption, redirects resources, diminishes environmental impacts from waste disposal and most importantly it contributes to the generation and redistribution of income and hence can tackle poverty reduction. Gathering, separating and selling recyclables has become a survival strategy for the excluded population in most cities. Very few cities in the world have incorporated recycling cooperatives and associations in waste management and only few policies have been developed to support this approach. The few experiences, however, highlight that besides redirecting solid waste into production streams, recycling also builds citizenship and contributes to creating community. Despite these benefits to the environment and to the community at large the recyclers are usually disregarded. As a result of their marginalization, the full potential of the informal and organized recycling industry is not harnessed. Theory on governance, social economy and resource management provide the grounding for the definition of a new concept for inclusive waste management that goes beyond waste disposal addressing responsible consumption and global sustainability. The paper discusses experiences from Latin American recycling networks and case studies on innovative public policies in Brazil. Waste as a resource enhances global sustainability and locally creates job opportunities. Stigmatization and prejudices against the recyclers are to be overcome and the real environmental services provided by this population are yet to be fully recognised.","Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Gutberlet, J (corresponding author), Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",,,,,,,,27,8,8,2,17,WIT PRESS,SOUTHAMPTON,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND",1743-3541,,978-1-84564-113-9,WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIR,WIT Trans.

A technique that can be used to precisely detect TBI is highly demanded. Here, we report on a synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) microspectroscopic imaging technique that can be exploited to identify TBI-induced injury by examining model mouse brain tissue slices. The samples were first examined by conventional histopathological techniques including hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and then spectroscopically imaged by SR-FTIR. SR-FTIR results show that the contents of protein and nucleic acid in the injured region are lower than their counterparts in the normal region. The injured and normal regions can be unambiguously distinguished from each other by the principle component analysis of the SR-FTIR spectral data corresponding to protein or nucleic acid. The images built from the spectral data of protein or nucleic acid clearly present the injured region of the brain tissue, which is in good agreement with the H&E staining image and optical image of the sample. Given the label-free and fingerprint features, the demonstrated method suggests potential application of SR-FTIR spectroscopic mapping for the digital and intelligent diagnosis of TBI by providing spatial and chemical information of the sample simultaneously.","[Guo, Yuansen; Zhang, Hua; Li, Dandan; Tang, Mingjie; Hu, Meidie; Tang, Dongyun; Yang, Zhongbo; Wang, Huabin] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Appl Phys, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yuansen; Zhang, Hua; Li, Dandan; Tang, Mingjie; Hu, Meidie; Tang, Dongyun; Yang, Zhongbo; Wang, Huabin] Chinese Acad Sci, Chongqing Engn Res Ctr High Resolut & Three Dimen, Chongqing Inst Green & Intelligent Technol, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China; [Guo, Yuansen; Tang, Mingjie] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tunan; Wang, Shi; Mu, Ning; Feng, Hua] Third Mil Med Univ, Southwest Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, Army Med Univ, Chongqing 400038, Peoples R China; [Chen, Tunan; Wang, Shi; Mu, Ning; Feng, Hua] Third Mil Med Univ, Key Lab Neurotrauma, Southwest Hosp, Army Med Univ, Chongqing 400038, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Xiaojie; Zhong, Jiajia; Tang, Yuzhao] Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Adv Res Inst, Zhangjiang Lab, Natl Facil Prot Sci Shanghai, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hua; Tang, Dongyun] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Chongqing Sch, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xuehua] Univ Alberta, Dept Chem & Mat Engn, Calgary, AB T6G 1H9, Canada","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Chongqing Institute of Green & Intelligent Technology, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Army Medical University; Army Medical University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Shanghai Advanced Research Institute, CAS; Zhangjiang Laboratory; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; University of Alberta","Wang, HB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Appl Phys, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China.;Wang, HB (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Chongqing Engn Res Ctr High Resolut & Three Dimen, Chongqing Inst Green & Intelligent Technol, Chongqing 400714, Peoples R China.;Tang, YZ (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Shanghai Adv Res Inst, Zhangjiang Lab, Natl Facil Prot Sci Shanghai, Shanghai 201210, Peoples R China.",tangyuzhao@zjlab.org.cn; wanghuabin@citig.ac.cn,"Wang, Huabin/AAA-1398-2022; Feng, Hua/AAX-4121-2021; Feng, Hua/ITV-6671-2023; Chen, Tunan/GQB-1846-2022","Feng, Hua/0000-0003-4489-9217; Feng, Hua/0000-0003-4489-9217; Chen, Tunan/0000-0003-0460-5632; Mu, Ning/0000-0002-5195-4838","National Natural Science Foundation of China [U1932132, 11604332, U1632273, U1732130]; Central Government Supported Key Instrument Program of China [YXGYQ201700136]; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing [cstc2018jcyjAX0405, cstc2019jcyj-msxmX0654]; Chongqing Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Central Government Supported Key Instrument Program of China; Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing); Chongqing Collaborative Innovation Center for Brain Science,"The authors would like to thank the staff from BL01B beamline of National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai (NFPS) at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility for assistance during data collection.

Schumpeter (1934) already predicted that technological change would be decisive, assuming that companies that were not capable of adapting to innovations would not survive in the market. In this sense, Porter (1985 and 1990) indicated what competitiveness was: competitive advantage derives from the way in which companies organize and carry out discrete activities.... To gain competitive advantage over its rivals, a company must offer a service at a value comparable to that of the competitor, but carry out the activities more efficiently than its competitors (lower cost) or carry out the activities in a peculiar way that creates greater value for the buyer and allows for an overpricing (differentiation). Undoubtedly, the correct use and management of ICTs constitutes a differentiation (Fernandez, Bernal, Mozas and Medina, 2019; Moreno and Sempere, 2019). ICTs, therefore, have emerged as necessary elements for achieving economic development. This is such an accepted fact that the European Union indicates that the development of ICTs is vital for Europe's competitiveness in today's increasingly digitalized world economy. During the 2014-2020 funding period, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) set aside more than 20,000 million euros for investment in ICTs and the European Commission established the Digital Europe 2021-2027 program, which aims to support the digital transformation of the European economy and society and, in this way, transfer its benefits to European citizens and companies (Regulation of the European Parliament and Council establishing the Digital Europe program for the period 2021-2027). Within this digitalization process, made more urgent by Covid-19, cooperatives seem the best way to channel the collaborative economy, under the modality of working on a digital platform (Arrieta, 2019). In this paper we focus our analysis on one family of the Social Economy: agricultural cooperatives. Specifically, we will go into the analysis of the Spanish olive cooperative movement for several reasons: a) Spain is the world's leading producer of olive oil and more than 70% of it is produced by cooperatives (Cooperativas Agroalimentarias de Espana, 2017) and the Consejo Economico y Social de la Provincia de Jaen, 2019). According to the data provided by the International Olive Oil Council (2019 a and b) for the 2018-19 campaign, Spain has produced more than 51% of the world's olive oils and the new plantations predict a constant increase; b) there are 11,316,000 hectares in the world that are exclusively dedicated to the cultivation of 1 500 million olive trees (72% are mountain and hill), located mainly in the Mediterranean basin (79%), which gives them an enormous environmental value (at the same time that they serve to reduce erosion and constitute a CO2 sink) which leads them to be considered by many researchers as public goods (Mozas, 2019b); c) annually, an increase in the world's olive grove surface area is observed, which represents 1% per year (between 34 and 45 million seedlings, which means 154,000 new hectares). The importance of the olive grove is spreading worldwide, since there are already 56 countries in which the olive grove is cultivated and 169 in which its products are consumed (Vilar and Cardenas, 2016) and these figures are increasing year after year (Mozas, 2019b); d) on the other hand, the production of olive oil with respect to the total of oils and fats produced in the world represents barely 2%. However, consumption has been growing at between 2 and 4% annually, which is why companies are interested in this product. In fact, the turnover of the sector has experienced a growing increase in recent years, ranging from 9,000 to 13,600 million euros per year and employing more than 30 million people (Vilar and Cardenas, 2016). All these reasons make it a strategic sector worldwide and for Spain in particular. The main objective we have set ourselves is to verify which are the structural, organizational and commercial factors that favor technological innovation in the second degree olive oil cooperatives in Spain. From the theoretical framework that has been analyzed, the following work proposals have been derived: Proposition 1. Training employees in ICTs favors innovation in the organization. Proposition 2. The application of measures aimed at commitment to CSR favors innovation in the organization. Proposition 3. The degree of internationalization, measured by the percentage of exports, favors innovation in the organization. Proposition 4. The commitment to organic production favors innovation in the organization. Proposition 5. The degree of business integration, measured through the number of member cooperatives, favors innovation in the organization. Population and method The organizations analyzed in this study have a total of 449 companies (444 cooperatives: 1 SAT; 3 SA; 1 cooperative group), most of them first degree cooperatives, integrating more than 165,000 individual members with a turnover of more than 2 billion euros and employing more than 2,500 people. These organizations are integrated around 35 second degree cooperative societies dedicated to the marketing of olive oil in Spain and constitute our population under study. In order to collect part of the data of this study a survey has been carried out on the population under study, but others were requested from Agro-Food Cooperatives in Spain within the framework of the work of the Socioeconomic Observatory of Spanish Agro-Food Cooperativism (OSCAE). The methodological technique used in this study was Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), using the fuzzy set approach (fsQCA) in order to establish technological and organizational variables that together are associated with a higher level of efficiency. The QCA technique, based on Boolean algebra, uses a verbal, conceptual and mathematical language that configures it as a qualitative and quantitative approach, combining the main advantages both (Ragin, 1987). Thus, applying QCA it is possible to systematically analyze a set of cases in order to determine causal patterns in the form of need and sufficiency relationships between a set of conditions and an outcome (Scheider & Wagemann, 2010). This method has the advantage over a regression technique of establishing relationships between subsets of variables to explain relationships. In addition, this technique allows working with medium-size samples not large enough to apply traditional quantitative methods (Ragin et al., 2003; Ragin and Rihoux, 2009). Specifically, in this study the fuzzy set variant (fsQCA) has been used, since it resolves one of the main drawbacks and criticisms of the initial method, called csQCA, which is its strictly dichotomous approach (Sehring et al., 2013). The dependent variable is the degree of technological innovation. This variable has been created by considering the different ICTs used by the company in its business performance. Thus, a count has been made of the number of technologies used by the company, considering the following: intranet, website, presence in social networks, e-shop, presence in electronic markets and apps. For their part, the causal variables used have been: training in ICT of human resources (staff and top management), the degree of commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility, the export nature, the sale of ecological supply, and business integration. The results obtained in this study allow us to verify, by means of the fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) technique, that the immersion of the companies in ICTs is favored by the following factors: the intensity of cooperative integration, measured by the number of first degree cooperatives or other entities that make up the second degree cooperative; the ICT training of the employees; the export character of the cooperative, the offer of ecological products and the degree of commitment of the cooperatives to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actions. The original value of this study is the direct link between economic development and innovation and investment in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). Furthermore, the conclusion we draw is that far from considering Corporate Social Responsibility as a burden for companies and institutions, it should be analyzed and integrated into organizations as an opportunity. The relationship between these variables will improve not only the competitive position of the company, but also the situation of its environment.","[Mozas Moral, Adoracion; Bernal Jurado, Enrique; Fernandez Ucles, Domingo; Puentes Poyatos, Raquel] Univ Jaen, Jaen, Spain; [Medina Viruel, Miguel Jesus] Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain",Universidad de Jaen; Universidad de Cordoba,"Moral, AM (corresponding author), Univ Jaen, Jaen, Spain.",amozas@ujaen.es; ebernal@ujaen.es; dfucles@ujaen.es; mjmedina@uco.es; rpuentes@ujaen.es,"Fernández Uclés, Domingo/JBJ-2115-2023; Moral, Adoración Mozas/E-3722-2016; Jurado, Enrique Bernal/H-4259-2014; Fernández Uclés, Domingo/D-4597-2016","Fernández Uclés, Domingo/0000-0001-7335-0296; Jurado, Enrique Bernal/0000-0001-8241-2866; Fernández Uclés, Domingo/0000-0001-7335-0296",,,,,62,7,7,14,85,CIRIEC-ESPANA,VALENCIA,"AVE NARANJOS, S-N, EDIF DEP ORIENTAL 2P21, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",0213-8093,1989-6816,,CIRIEC,CIRIEC,NOV,2020,100,,,,,,67,85,,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.100.17712,http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.100.17712,,,19,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,PA9HF,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000595937600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

At the same time, the settler state has tried to limit their inclusion by restricting the boundaries of indigeneity. By arguing that Indigenous peoples are not present in the project area or are not doing traditional activities, it aims to exclude some groups from the decision-making, monitoring, and benefits of extractivist projects. In rendering indigeneity as spatially and economically contained, government and industry pursue settler colonial fantasies of Indigenous erasure and absence. This paper uses a recent public inquiry into the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project as a mechanism to trace how indigeneity has been mobilized in resource conflicts between the state, industry, and numerous Indigenous peoples of the Labrador peninsula since the 18th century. Linking hydroelectric developments with examples of mining, logging, and commercial fishing, the paper explores the dynamic between government efforts to facilitate extractive industry by containing indigeneity and Indigenous assertions of a more flexible and dynamic reality. Instead of abiding to the state's limiting version of indigeneity, the Indigenous peoples of the Labrador peninsula are challenging and reforming environmental governance by demonstrating that they are, in fact, elsewhere and otherwise.","[Procter, Andrea] Mem Univ, Queens Coll, Dept Archaeol, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada",Memorial University Newfoundland,"Procter, A (corresponding author), Mem Univ, Queens Coll, Dept Archaeol, St John, NF A1B 3X9, Canada.",andrea.procter@mun.ca,,,,,,,97,7,8,1,4,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",2214-790X,2214-7918,,EXTRACT IND SOC,Extr.

The Yangtze River Basin is an important ecological security barrier in China and the Wanjiang City Belt (WCB) along the Yangtze River is directly related to the ecological security pattern of the entire basin. Based on the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model and a geographical information system (GIS) platform, an ecosystem security evaluation index system was constructed to measure and evaluate the evolution of ecosystem security in the WCB, China. Results showed that: 1) From 2000 to 2018, the overall level of ecological security in the study area was in a state of either early warning or medium warning, but the level of ecological security in each prefecture-level city was significantly different. 2) From the perspective of the evolution of the ecosystem, the value of its comprehensive evaluation index dropped from 4.255 in 2000 to 3.885 in 2018. From the perspective of subsystems, the value of Pressure comprehensive evaluation index is much higher than that of other subsystems, indicating that during the rapid development of the social economy, the pressure on the natural environment tended to rise, and triggered changes in the State and Response subsystems. 3) The coefficient of variation (CV) of the Driver was much higher than other factors influencing the ecological security system. There are large differences in the economic development and ecological evolution of the cities in the WCB. This study has improved the theoretical research on regional ecological security, and has certain practical guiding significance for building a beautiful, green and sustainable China and promoting global ecological security.","[Cao, Yuhong; Liu, Meiyun; Chen, Chen] Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Wuhu 241002, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yu; Cao, Weidong] Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Wuhu 241002, Peoples R China",Anhui Normal University; Anhui Normal University,"Cao, YH (corresponding author), Anhui Normal Univ, Sch Ecol & Environm, Wuhu 241002, Peoples R China.",hong923@ahnu.edu.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [41571124],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Under the auspices of National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41571124),,35,7,11,5,71,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1002-0063,1993-064X,,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

Thus, this work aims to do a revision of the reality of the spanish university and its role facing the technological challenge. In addition, it aims to make an analysis of the presence and weight of the social economy in the sectors most identified with the so-called fourth industrial revolution, to establish if there are economic and financial differences that explain the higher presence of the investor owned firms versus social economy enterprises. Design and methodology In addition to the literature revision, we have used SABI database, in order to identify social economy companies that operate in technological sectors, specifically those related to digital economy and the fourth industrial revolution. Financial and economic variables of both have been analyzed and compared. Results and conclusions From the literature review and the analysis carried out, this work concludes that the presence of social economy companies in technological sectors related to the digital economy is smaller than the one of the investor owned companies, and in addition this presence is decreasing over the years. On the other hand, there are no differences in their economic and financial indicators that support a greater preference for investor owned enterprises capital compared to social economy enterprises. We conclude that in order to advance in this competitive economy with values, the role of the university is crucial, fostering and developing an innovative, intelligent and with values entrepreneurship. In the last four decades the social economy has undergone significant progress in quantitative and qualitative terms, and so has entrepreneurship. However, it is still necessary to promote the use of social economy formulas in entrepreneurship derived from the university ecosystem, and with it, its presence in the most advanced technological sectors, and in particular those most closely linked to the so-called fourth industrial revolution.","[Julia Igual, Juan Francisco; Melia Marti, Elena; Miranda Ribera, Eduardo] Univ Politecn Valencia, CEGEA, Campus Vera S-N, Valencia 46023, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia,"Igual, JFJ; Martí, EM; Ribera, EM (corresponding author), Univ Politecn Valencia, CEGEA, Campus Vera S-N, Valencia 46023, Spain.",jfjulia@esp.upv.es,"Melia-Marti, Elena/K-5154-2016",,,,,,30,7,7,1,8,CIRIEC-ESPANA,VALENCIA,"AVE NARANJOS, S-N, EDIF DEP ORIENTAL 2P21, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",0213-8093,1989-6816,,CIRIEC,CIRIEC,MAR,2020,98,,,,,,31,57,,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.98.15905,http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.98.15905,,,27,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,KZ6IC,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000523362600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This was done by adapting and testing a measurement scale based on the one-dimensional model proposed by Porter. Design/methodology/approach Field work was carried out, with a structured questionnaire being given to a significant sample of workers in Ecuadorian cooperatives (2,499 employees and heads of department). The scale was adapted through a structural equation model. Findings The results show that the adaptation of the measuring scale for affective organizational commitment using a one-dimensional vision is consistent for the cooperative sector. In addition, the analysis of the socio-demographic variables and the work position show that some of them have a statistically significant relationship with organizational commitment. Practical implications - The proposed scale can contribute to the management of human capital in cooperatives in Ecuador. It can also be used as a tool to support the national agency in charge of the cooperative sector in this country (Superintendencia de Economia Popular y Solidaria, Superintendency of Popular and Solidarity Economy). By applying this tool, social economy organizations in Ecuador can measure the level of their employees' affective commitment with the institution they work in. Using the results, the people in charge and the leaders of the organization shall be able to introduce strategies to develop this organizational variable that is crucial for the proper management of human resources and, therefore, to help to obtain the institutional purposes. Originality/value This research project presents a measuring tool that can discover the unique features of the cooperative sector in a developing country such as Ecuador as it provides a special framework for managing human resources in this sector. Additionally, in a cooperative organization many employees have different roles in the same company. This tool can be adapted for other kinds of cooperatives with different activities (financial and non-financial activities) in different sectors.","[Hidalgo-Fernandez, Amalia; Santa Cruz, Francisco Gonzalez] Univ Cordoba, Cordoba, Spain; [Mero, Nelly Moreira] Univ Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabi, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Manta, Ecuador; [Alcivar, Maria Iliana Loor] Univ Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabi, Manta, Ecuador",Universidad de Cordoba; Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro De Manabi; Universidad Laica Eloy Alfaro De Manabi,"Mero, NM (corresponding author), Univ Laica Eloy Alfaro de Manabi, Dept Accounting & Auditing, Manta, Ecuador.",ahidalgo@uco.es; nmoreiramero@hotmail.com; mili8_loal@hotmail.com; td1gosaf@uco.es,"Hidalgo-Fernández, Amalia/AFO-3158-2022; Santa Cruz, Francisco González/AAE-2480-2020","Santa Cruz, Francisco González/0000-0002-3872-7366; LOOR ALCIVAR, MARIA ILIANA/0000-0002-1396-5501; Hidalgo Fernandez, Maria Amalia/0000-0002-2764-6624",,,,,65,7,7,3,27,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0262-1711,1758-7492,,J MANAG DEV,J.

We sought to survey the effect of a self-care education program on quality of life and fatigue in gastrointestinal cancer patients who received chemotherapy. Methods: Ninety-one eligible gastrointestinal cancer patients were enrolled in this study and 86 valid samples were analyzed. Data were acquired with a demographics questionnaire, endpoint multidimensional questionnaire and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS software. Results: The self-care education intervention significantly improved the quality of life with respect to emotional function (p = 0.018), role function (p = 0.041), cognitive function (p = 0.038) and alleviated side effects such as nausea/vomiting (p = 0.028) and fatigue (p = 0.029). Further analysis demonstrated that the self-care education benefited total fatigue, affective fatigue and cognitive fatigue in gastrointestinal cancer patients regardless of baseline depression. Conclusion: Our results suggested the beneficial effects of the self-care education in both quality of life and antifatigue in gastrointestinal cancer patients under chemotherapy. The self-care education could be considered as a complementary approach during combination chemotherapy in gastrointestinal cancer patients.","[Xie, Jun] Nanjing Med Univ, Dept Oncol, Wuxi Peoples Hosp, Wuxi 214023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Tingli] Wuxi Childrens Hosp, Nursing Dept, Wuxi 214023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lu, Qun; Xu, Xiaomin; Cai, Yinghua; Xu, Zhenghong] Nanjing Med Univ, Internal Med Dept, Wuxi Peoples Hosp, Wuxi 214023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangnan University; Nanjing Medical University; Jiangnan University; Nanjing Medical University,"Zhu, TL (corresponding author), Wuxi Childrens Hosp, Nursing Dept, Wuxi 214023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Lu, Q (corresponding author), Nanjing Med Univ, Internal Med Dept, Wuxi Peoples Hosp, Wuxi 214023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",zhutingli_wuxi@163.com; 1662935168@qq.com,,,,,,,24,7,7,1,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2662-7671,,BMC COMPLEMENT MED,BMC Complement.

The indicators of population spatial density, including residential geo-objects' area, building existence index, terrain slope, night light intensity, density of point of interest (POI) and road network from Internet electronic maps, and locational factors such as the distances from road and river, are jointly applied to establish the relationship between these multivariable factors and quantitative index of population density using ML algorithms such as Random Forests and XGBoost. The predicated values of population density from the mined nonlinear regression relation are further used to calculate the weights of disaggregation of each unit, and then the population quantity distribution at the scale of residential geo-objects is obtained under the control of the total amount of population statistics. Experiments with a county area show that the methodology has the ability to achieve better results than the traditional deterministic methods by reproducing a more accurate and finer geographic population distribution pattern. Meanwhile, it is found that the optimization of mapping results may benefit from the multisources geospatial data, and thus the methodological framework can be recommended to be extended to other spatialization areas of socioeconomic data.","[Wu, Tianjun] Changan Univ, Sch Geol Engn & Geomat, Xian 710064, Peoples R China; [Wu, Tianjun] Fuzhou Univ, Key Lab Spatial Data Min & Informat Sharing, Minist Educ, Fuzhou 350000, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jiancheng; Dong, Wen; Gao, Lijing; Hu, Xiaodong; Sun, Yingwei] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Luo, Jiancheng; Dong, Wen; Gao, Lijing; Hu, Xiaodong; Sun, Yingwei] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Wu, Zhifeng] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Guangzhou 510000, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Jinsong] Hebei Normal Univ, Sch Resources & Environm Sci, Shijiazhuang 051530, Hebei, Peoples R China","Chang'an University; Fuzhou University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Aerospace Information Research Institute, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Guangzhou University; Hebei Normal University","Luo, JC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Remote Sensing Sci, Aerosp Informat Res Inst, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China.;Luo, JC (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China.",wutianjun1986@163.com; luojc@radi.ac.cn; dongwen01@radi.ac.cn; gaolj@radi.ac.cn; huxd@radi.ac.cn; gzuwzf@163.com; wfsunyingwei@yeah.net; ljslyx@sohu.com,"li, Li/JPA-0218-2023; wu, zhi/GXH-3041-2022; Wu, Jiaqiang/JUV-0151-2023; Wang, Ling/AGR-4917-2022; Liu, Shao/JFK-0166-2023; Yuan, Yu/KBQ-0606-2024; Lin, Fan/JZT-1441-2024; Luo, jian/HGE-7331-2022","Wu, Jiaqiang/0009-0004-0536-5364; Wang, Ling/0000-0003-0272-2974; Lin, Fan/0000-0002-7330-3833; Wu, Tianjun/0000-0003-0178-2342; Sun, Yingwei/0000-0002-3051-3259","National Natural Science Foundation of China [41631179, 41601437, 41671138]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, CHD [300102120201, 300102269205]; National Key Research and Development Program [2017YFB0503600]; NingxiaAcademy ofAgricultural and Forestry Sciences Foreign Science and Technology Cooperation Project [07030002]; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China [2018JQ1038]; Open Projects of Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining & Information Sharing of Ministry of Education, Fuzhou University [2018LSDMIS03]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, CHD; National Key Research and Development Program; NingxiaAcademy ofAgricultural and Forestry Sciences Foreign Science and Technology Cooperation Project; Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China; Open Projects of Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining & Information Sharing of Ministry of Education, Fuzhou University","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 41631179, Grant 41601437, and Grant 41671138, in part by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, CHD under Grant 300102120201 and Grant 300102269205, in part by the National Key Research and Development Program under Grant 2017YFB0503600, in part by theNingxiaAcademy ofAgricultural and Forestry Sciences Foreign Science and Technology Cooperation Project under Grant 07030002, in part by the Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China under Grant 2018JQ1038, and in part by the Open Projects of Key Laboratory of Spatial Data Mining & Information Sharing of Ministry of Education, Fuzhou University under Grant 2018LSDMIS03.",,76,7,7,10,57,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",1939-1404,2151-1535,,IEEE J-STARS,IEEE J.

J,"Gallego-Bono, JR; Tapia-Baranda, MR",,,,"Gallego-Bono, Juan R.; Tapia-Baranda, Maria R.",,,The values of the social economy as drivers of change in clusters with a strong fragmentation of knowledge: the case of sugar cane in Veracruz (Mexico),CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Fragmentation of knowledge; Discrimination; Social economy; Social innovation; Cooperative values; Sugarcane; Mexico,INNOVATION SYSTEMS; NETWORKS; ANECOOP,"Frequently, clusters in developing countries are characterized by a strong fragmentation of knowledge rooted in an intense concentration of economic and political power. This concentration of power forms the basis for the generation of innovation networks, that leave out local knowledge as well as a large number of actors in the cluster, contributing to the existing high social and economic inequality. This is the case in the sugarcane cluster of Veracruz. In this context, the main objective of the article is to show that in this type of reality, the modernization of the cluster and the generation of new networks of innovation that integrate local resources and knowledge as well as potential endogenous requires, as a precondition, the generation of social innovation. In order to meet this objective, an evolutionary theoretical framework is developed, explaining both the inertia as well as the forces of change, combined with other approaches that address the phenomena of power and social innovation. This theoretical framework will try to show how the values of the social economy can be the vehicle of social innovation and the engine of change in the cluster, through the generation of novelties in itself. These novelties come from the emergence of new actors, new skills, new relationships and new rules. Based on this theoretical framework and in line with the interest of this article for the knowledge of the processes and the forces that move them, qualitative research has been developed in the sugarcane cluster of Veracruz (Mexico). This research relies primarily on the realization of almost a hundred in-depth personal interviews conducted in 2017 and 2018, with companies in the value chain, various associations, training and research centers as well as experts in the sector. The sample of companies has sought to privilege the presence of the sugar mills and a group of new dynamic firms, and for different reasons: in the first place, for its central role in the organization of the cluster which we aim to understand and, in the second place, due to its transformational potential. It has been shown that in the sugarcane cluster of Veracruz, the value chain organization exhibits an important vertical integration in the hands of sugar mills, and whose correlation is the concentration of most of the public research efforts around the innovation network of these sugar mills. On the other hand, some local actors and knowledge are marginalized and with little communication between them, with the problem of fragmentation of knowledge and lack of penetration of new sources of information and innovation that this implies. Also, it has been shown that the essential question is, that behind this productive concentration there are a series of political and business networks, which in addition to ensuring the interests of the participating groups are extending a set of values that feed violence and discrimination. In this context, the mobilization of dispersed and already existing resources on which development depends (Hirschman, 1961), as a basis for deploying own trajectories that allow escape from external economic and technological dependence (Prebisch, 1981), it involves an exercise for the development of people's capacities, putting the emphasis on human development (Sen, 2000). In this sense, the article shows how social economy can contribute to the transformation of Latin American clusters through their moral rearmament that places people at the centre of political concerns and scientific analysis. Within the framework of the dominant political-economic network, it was shown how the creation of formal cooperatives cannot play, either alone or through the second-degree management and cooperative teams, the transforming role of the clusters which was attributed to it by the literature in other clusters of developed regions (Gallego-Bono & Chaves-Avila, 2015 and 2016). The reason is that in this framework, the cooperatives are captured and used spuriously by this network. However, the article shows that the values of the social economy can constitute a vehicle to mobilize the endogenous resources communicating with their values and behavioural patterns, an actual alternative project of society. This project is making its way through the development of a series of socially emancipatory business and associative initiatives that are inspired and promote responsibility, social capital and a new, more inclusive vision of business activity while mobilizing local resources. These are individual and collective initiatives that encourage new forms of organization and greater productive diversification, which introduce more substantial complexity in the value chain, to extend and take advantage of endogenous knowledge, but based on the mobilization of critical external connections. New actors are detected that no longer pursue the use of resources supported by imports, external demand for technology and agricultural sciences. These are young entrepreneurs endowed with high skills and new values, leading them to turn their attention to human resources, intellectual capital and endogenous capacities of the territory. In other words, towards the use of resources that were mostly there, but that due to differences in values and power between the actors involved, they were not noticed until very recently. This implies the valorization of a part of the local knowledge collection, part of a tacit nature, in terms of agricultural production, industrial transformation, etc. A use of local knowledge that serves as a basis for the intensification of the division of labour and specialization in the value chain, as well as the improvement of external sector-based and spatial connections in addition to the opening of new markets. One of the main limitations of this research is that it focuses on a single case study. Still, the problem it describes is considered, in particular, the framework of economic-political power and its main external links through the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to be extensible to other Mexican agri-food clusters. It is suggesting, on the other hand, an essential line of future research. The fundamental contribution of this work consists in developing, conceptually and empirically, a feasible way to integrate endogenous resources into innovation processes within the framework of clusters of developing countries, especially in Latin America, and to change the habit or tendency to disaprove and exclude them which predominates among themselves. So all this through the practice of the human values of inclusion, participation and equity that promotes social innovation and the social economy as a privileged vehicle for itself, not with a moralizing purpose, but with a practical mission of good governance and transparency as vectors of innovation. The article contributes some crucial details to the existing literature on clusters as well as social and technological innovation. In the first place, in the face of writing that highlights the lack of cooperation in Latin American clusters (Rocha, 2015), it is evident that the fundamental problem is not in here, but in a socially exclusive partnership. Secondly, it is evident that in this type of clusters social innovation is a condition of technological innovation. A social innovation that has a marked radical character (Marques et al, 2018) more for the depth and vision of the world and the values that inform it, than for the real challenge in the established powers. Thirdly, it has been shown that the stimulus to change cannot come from cooperative initiatives but from the broader values of democracy, participation and commitment with the community that distil the set of social economy initiatives (Chaves and Monzon, 2018). The picture emerges, both theoretically and empirically, of the possibility of new individual and collective business initiatives bearing new values and new internal and external relationships capable of introducing variety into the territorial system. These actors are driving a new logic of integration of knowledge in the cluster, along with an advancement in the division of labour and the generation of organizational, product and market innovations within the cluster and the value chain. In terms of economic policy, it is inferred from the article that in order to carry out actions capable of overcoming the fragmentation of knowledge in these types of clusters, policies should generate spaces of confluence of interests of the innovation networks, while promoting participatory and inclusive governance based on the transparency of the institutions. In the type of cluster considered, supporting their values is more important than prioritizing the legal formulas of the social economy.","[Gallego-Bono, Juan R.] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Aplicada, Valencia, Spain; [Tapia-Baranda, Maria R.] Univ Valencia, Econ Social, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Gallego-Bono, JR (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Aplicada, Valencia, Spain.;Tapia-Baranda, MR (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Econ Social, Valencia, Spain.",Juan.R.Gallego@uv.es; tapiacharis@gmail.com,"Bono, Juan Ramón Gallego/AAU-2260-2020","Bono, Juan Ramón Gallego/0000-0003-3147-296X; MariaR, Tapia-Baranda/0000-0001-8106-4935",,,,,78,7,7,3,45,CIRIEC-ESPANA,VALENCIA,"AVE NARANJOS, S-N, EDIF DEP ORIENTAL 2P21, VALENCIA, 46022, SPAIN",0213-8093,1989-6816,,CIRIEC,CIRIEC,NOV,2019,97,,,,,,75,109,,10.7203/CIRIEC-E.97.14108,http://dx.doi.org/10.7203/CIRIEC-E.97.14108,,,35,Economics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Business & Economics,JX0FI,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000503419400003,View Full Record in Web of Science

To explore this, we used the Poyang Lake Basin, which is divided into three overly exploited sub-regions, as an example. This paper selected the different types of sub-regions of Poyang Lake Basin as the research subjects, and then proposed a game model to study evolutionarily stable equilibrium strategies. The results are as follows: (1) the behavior of the sub-regions of Poyang Lake Basin are affected by one another and cannot achieve equilibrium through independent games, which also need external forces to coordinate the three reaches; (2) the benefits improve gradually from the state of non-cooperation to full cooperation and reach an ideal equilibrium when all the sub-regions choose the strategy of cooperation; (3) the strategic choice of sub-reaches is difficult to maximize the overall benefits of the basin in the absence of external constraints. To ensure that the sub-regions choose the cooperative strategy, the central government should support the cooperative subsidies of local governments. In addition to improving the equilibrium state of the sub-reaches, this study proposes the following policy implications: constructing a basin plan and promoting fiscal transfer payments, inducing an industrial gradient transfer, and strengthening the payment for the use of water resources.","[Lv, Tiangui; Yang, Lei] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Tourism & Urban Management, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Lv, Tiangui; Xie, Hualin; Lu, Hua; Zhang, Xinmin] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ecol Civilizat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics,"Lu, H (corresponding author), Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Inst Ecol Civilizat, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",lvtiangui@163.com; xiehualin@jxufe.edu.cn; luhuanj@126.com; zhangxm1217@yahoo.com; yanglei9712@163.com,"Lv, Tiangui/GWC-4432-2022","Xie, Hualin/0000-0002-4951-4526; Zhang, Xinmin/0000-0002-5180-8371; , lu/0000-0002-9697-0794","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71864016, 71803071]; Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [17YJC630100]; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China [2017M622098]; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [2017KY55]; Postdoctoral Science Daily Foundation of Jiangxi Province [2017RC036]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province [20171BAA218017]; Humanities and Social Sciences Fund Project of Jiangxi Province [GL18242]; 13th Five-Year planning project of the Jiangxi Academy of Social Science [16GL31]; Technology Foundation of the Jiangxi Education Department [GJJ160460]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province; Postdoctoral Science Daily Foundation of Jiangxi Province; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province); Humanities and Social Sciences Fund Project of Jiangxi Province; 13th Five-Year planning project of the Jiangxi Academy of Social Science; Technology Foundation of the Jiangxi Education Department,"Funding support for this research includes the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71864016 & No. 71803071), the Humanity and Social Science Youth Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (No. 17YJC630100), the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (No. 2017M622098), the Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. 2017KY55), the Postdoctoral Science Daily Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. 2017RC036), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (No. 20171BAA218017), the Humanities and Social Sciences Fund Project of Jiangxi Province (No. GL18242), the 13th Five-Year planning project of the Jiangxi Academy of Social Science (No. 16GL31) and the Technology Foundation of the Jiangxi Education Department (No. GJJ160460).",,53,7,7,3,31,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2019,11,22,,,,,,,6237,10.3390/su11226237,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su11226237,,,14,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,JW8DR,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000503277900050,View Full Record in Web of Science

In turn, management is conditioned by the legal and institutional conditions by which it could be affected. In small-scale fisheries, associative activity usually acquires special relevance and specific characteristics, singularity that is considered in the article. In the case study, referring to Galicia (NW Spain), the fishermen's associations studied (cofradias) are characterised as firms in which workers participate in management (participatory firms), their dynamics based on their organisational structure and the business flows observed (real, decisional and financial). The approach makes it necessary to consider the institutional framework and analyse the contractual relationships between the agents that form an integral part of the association, as well as their involvement in the fisheries' management. In parallel, the analysis also emphasises the distinctive characteristics of this case in comparison with other Social Economy organisations, particularly on account of the links between the cofradias and the competent public administration.","[Garcia-Lorenzo, Iria; Maria Varela-Lafuente, Manuel] Univ Vigo, ECOBAS, ERENEA, Campus Mar, Vigo, Spain; [Jose Cabaleiro-Casal, Maria] Univ Vigo, ECOBAS, Vigo, Spain",Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo,"García-Lorenzo, I (corresponding author), Univ Vigo, Dept Appl Econ, Fac Econ, Campus Lagoas Marcosende, Vigo 36310, Spain.",iriagarcia@uvigo.es; mcasal@uvigo.es; mmvarela@uvigo.es,"García Lorenzo, Iria/AAD-2152-2022","García Lorenzo, Iria/0000-0002-6122-672X; Cabaleiro-Casal, Maria Jose/0000-0002-9089-9261","FEDER; Xunta de Galicia [ED431C2018/48, ED431E2018/02]",FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),This work was supported by FEDER and Xunta de Galicia (ED431C2018/48 and ED431E2018/02).,,66,7,7,2,7,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0964-5691,1873-524X,,OCEAN COAST MANAGE,Ocean Coastal Manage.,AUG 1,2019,178,,,,,,,,104841,10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104841,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.104841,,,11,Oceanography; Water Resources,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Oceanography; Water Resources,IM1XF,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000477784400023,View Full Record in Web of Science
J,"Caro-González, FJ; Pérez-Suárez, M; Sánchez-Torne, I",,,,"Javier Caro-Gonzalez, Francisco; Perez-Suarez, Macarena; Sanchez-Torne, Isadora",,,Characteristics of the Social Journalistic Enterprises,CIRIEC-ESPANA REVISTA DE ECONOMIA PUBLICA SOCIAL Y COOPERATIVA,,,Spanish,Article,,,,,,Social Enterprises; Journalistic Enterprise; Non-profit organization; Journalism; Social Economy,NONPROFIT,"Contextualization The sector of communication companies is undergoing important changes, some of which are motivated by the eruption of digital technologies and the loss of credibility of traditional media. This situation is favoring the emergence of new forms of journalism and new sustainable business models (Galan, 2017); many of these models are cataloged as Social Enterprises. However, the Social Enterprise concept is not sufficiently developed in the field of communication. Only in Spain, during the economic crisis (2008-2016), journalists have created more than 500 media that try to face the employment precariousness and the lack of credibility of the sector (Palacios, 2015). The new business models appear as one of the solutions to guarantee the survival of the journalistic company (Larranaga-Rubio, 2010). These emerging forms are oriented, on the one hand, to create quality of employment, and on the other hand, to meet the need for information from society through innovations in services or information products. These journalistic projects adopt legal forms very different from each other; some forms can be cataloged as Social Enterprises. A simple look at their websites shows how they fit the definition provided by the European Commission: they are organizations  whose main objective is to have a social impact beyond the generation of a benefit for their owners or shareholders. They work providing goods and services to the market through entrepreneurship and innovation, as well as using its benefits primarily to achieve social objectives. They are managed in an open and responsible manner and, in particular, involve workers, consumers and interest groups affected by their commercial activity (COM-2011, 682: 2, Brussels, 25.10.2011). Notwithstanding, there is no definition of the term Social Journalistic Enterprise (SJE), nor of the characteristics that can help to identify this sort of organization. In general, Social Enterprise is a concept that is not yet delimited theoretically and about which there is some confusion due to the existence of different approaches (Cabra de Luna, 2017). In addition, providing this definition is even more complicated if it is limited to the specific field of journalism. Objective The main objective of this work is to identify the characteristics of the SJE in order to determine the variables associated with non-profit organization and to examine the fit to the approach of Social Enterprise proposed by EMES (European Research Network) (Defourny and Nyssens, 2012). Methodology To achieve the objective, the digital media collected in the SembraMedia Directory are analyzed. In this database, the information has been obtained from 509 companies: 365 self-described as nonprofit and 144 as for profit. This provides information of several variables: the founding members, the mission, the type of journalistic genre, the owners, the sources of income and the informative sources, among others. In each group, the common elements from the different variables have been researched. Subsequently, the results of each group have been compared. The data are analyzed statistically through SPSS software. On the other hand, the theoretical focus of reference for the development of this research is the conceptualization offered by EMES, who identifies 11 criteria grouped into three dimensions: 1 economic and entrepreneurial; 2) social; and 3) participative management. Among the 11 criteria, there is agreement in the scientific community on the non-distribution of benefits as the most determinant criterion. The criterion of non-profit constitutes a guarantee for consumers (...) The absence of profit is a protection against two negative phenomena: adverse selection and moral risk (Laville, 2015: 94). For this reason, this criterion will serve to select the companies of the journalistic sector beforehand. In view of the variables included in the directory, the EMES criteria for the Social Enterprise and the nature of the information activity, seven hypotheses have been established. Results The outcomes are presented from seven differentiating variables between for-profit organizations (CAL) and non-profit organizations (SAL). From this, the main findings are that 71.71% are for-profit organizations (CAL) and 28.29% non-profit (SAL). Most of the companies are based in Latin America. Significant differences are found between the CAL and SAL companies, mostly related to the business model as digital media. An example of this is how SAL organizations show a significantly greater result in foundations and subsidies, education and entertainment and workshops. The territorial coverage in the group of companies analyzed is fundamentally national (78.55% CAL and 73.38% SAL). Only in the international contents were significant differences found between both media, being the CAL media those that presented the highest percentage. In general, the main subjects of the digital media studied are three: culture and entertainment (55.07% CAL and 54.17% SAL), politics (48.88% CAL and 43.26% SAL), and society and human rights (42.13% CAL and 51.77% SAL). Regardless of these results, the SAL media showed a significantly higher result in the environmental issue. In relation to the journalistic genre used by digital media, the most used was the informative (62.35% CAL and 44.86% SAL). On the other hand, significant differences have been found with higher percentages in the SAL organizations in four genres. The most recurrent technique used to compile the information is news or breaking news. At the same time, it was the CAL organizations that opted more for this modality, while the SAL entities showed a significantly greater result in coverage and data journalism. All the digital media work with professional journalists to elaborate the content of their news, although it is the CAL organizations that work with them in a significantly higher percentage. On the other hand, 15.83% of SAL organizations use content prepared by the founders, while the CALs only use 5.36%. All these results let us identify the characteristics associated with non-profit organizations and interpret them, based on the definition of Social Enterprise suggested by EMES. Practical conclusions and original value. Implications and limitations to research There are important differences between digital media with and without profit motive in terms of: financing, thematic content and its origin, scope of news, support platform used, journalistic technique and gender used. These differences allowed us to develop the seven hypotheses. The main contributions of this work are two: we address a sector that is not usually studied in the field of the Social Enterprise, thus contributing to this field and to the conceptualization of the Social Journalistic Company within the framework of the EMES approach. In any case, the authors of this research agree with Nogales (2017: 122) that the most important aspects of the Social Enterprise are not the precise contours of its definition, but a common shared notion that captures its added value is necessary, mostly at the time of initiating public policies and actions both citizens and in the business sector that promote their development. The importance of this research lies in generating new empirical evidence on two topics, Communication Sector and Social Enterprise, in a relation in which the literature has significant deficiencies. Regarding the limitations of this research, we can identify two: the sample, since a greater number of companies may be useful to qualify and observe more variables; and the empirical limitation, derived from the limitation in time and the data capture method of capturing data.","[Javier Caro-Gonzalez, Francisco] Univ Seville, Dept Adm Empresas & Mkt, Seville, Spain; [Perez-Suarez, Macarena; Sanchez-Torne, Isadora] Univ Seville, Dept Econ Aplicada 3, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla; University of Sevilla,"Caro-González, FJ (corresponding author), Univ Seville, Dept Adm Empresas & Mkt, Seville, Spain.",fjcaro@us.es; mperez32@us.es; isanchez6@us.es,"GONZÁLEZ, FRANCISCO J.

The research findings are as follows: (1) the main hydrological disasters in Urumqi are caused by floods, snow, and droughts, among which floods have the greatest risk, while the risk of droughts is minimal. (2) There are various and complex types of flood disasters in Urumqi, which have frequent occurrences, a wide range of influence, and easily cause secondary disasters. Snow disasters are complex and diverse, with frequent occurrences. Moreover, there are varied and complex types of drought disasters in Urumqi, which have frequent occurrences. Drought disasters in Urumqi, which last for a long time, have enormous effects on agricultural and forestry crops, while the frequencies of frost and hail disasters in Urumqi are lower. (3) Historical hydrological disasters in Urumqi mainly occurred from May to August and November to March of the following year, which are high-frequency months for hydrological disasters. (4) Flood disasters in Urumqi occur every 1.59years, on average, while snow disasters in Urumqi occur every 1.65years, on average. Additionally, flood and snow disasters could easily occur in the next 15years. (5) The hydrological disaster environment in Urumqi is mainly affected by local temperature, sunshine, elevation, topography, precipitation, plant resources, and the social economy.","[Li, Xingwei; Du, Jianguo] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Long, Hongyu] Southwest Petr Univ, Sch Civil Engn & Architecture, Chengdu 610500, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Sun, Guili] Xinjiang Agr Univ, Coll Forestry & Hort, Urumqi 830052, Peoples R China",Jiangsu University; Southwest Petroleum University; Xinjiang Agricultural University,"Du, JG (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Management, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",djg@ujs.edu.cn,"Du, Jianguo/V-5788-2019; Sun, Guili/V-5806-2019; Li, Xingwei/M-8450-2018; Long, Hongyu/V-5811-2019","Du, Jianguo/0000-0001-9628-7496; Sun, Guili/0000-0002-7395-5444; Li, Xingwei/0000-0002-8853-356X; Long, Hongyu/0000-0003-3826-619X",Special Funds of the National Social Science Fund of China [18VSJ038]; National Science Foundation of China [71471076],Special Funds of the National Social Science Fund of China; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Special Funds of the National Social Science Fund of China (18VSJ038) and supported in part by the National Science Foundation of China (under grant 71471076).,,49,7,7,1,32,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0177-798X,1434-4483,,THEOR APPL CLIMATOL,Theor.

From the emergency treatment of accidents such as chemical spills and explosions from all over the world. Some treatments have limited effectiveness due to lack of understanding for pollution scope and its development trend, leading to pollutant diffusion and more serious impacts. Therefore, it is meaningful to carry out researches on selecting a suitable model to simulate the time variations and spatial distributions of pollutant concentrations in different water periods under accident conditions. This study chose a method that can simulate the temporal and spatial variations of pollutant concentrations under accidents conditions in the drinking water source area. And parameter calibration and model validation were carried out. The method was applied to the Zigui drinking water source area. It is located in the Fenghuangshan area of Zigui County, Yichang City and it supplies water to Zigui County and has a water supply population of 40,000. In this paper, the permanganate index was selected as the characteristic index, The change of the permanganate index over time in the water intake of the drinking water source area, the change of the maximum permanganate index of the drinking water source area over time, and the temporal and spatial variation of the permanganate index of the whole drinking water source area were analyzed, and the change of permanganate index in different water periods of the drinking water source area were compared. Under the assumption of accident conditions, the permanganate index of the drinking water source area intake of drinking water reached the standard after 1.93 h of dry period, reached the standard after 1.74 h of falling period, reached the standard after 1.73 h of flood period and reached the standard after 1.72 h of impounding period. The permanganate index of the whole drinking water source area reached the standard after 4.39 h of dry period, 3.98 h of falling period, 2.48 h of flood period, and 2.47 h of impounding period. This new model can predict the spatial-temporal variation of pollutants and it can provide a reference and a tool for relevant researchers and managers to provide technical support for water resource management.","[Ding, Xiaowen; Han, Xu; Kang, Bo; Zhai, Aifeng] North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, MOE Key Lab Resources & Environm Syst Optimizat, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Ding, Xiaowen] Univ Regina, Inst Energy Environm & Sustainable Communities, Regina, SK S4S 7H9, Canada",North China Electric Power University; University of Regina,"Ding, XW (corresponding author), North China Elect Power Univ, Coll Environm Sci & Engn, MOE Key Lab Resources & Environm Syst Optimizat, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",binger2000dxw@hotmail.com,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of PRC [YQ2017002]; National key scientific and technological projects of the PRC [2014ZX07104-005],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of PRC; National key scientific and technological projects of the PRC,This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of PRC [YQ2017002] and the National key scientific and technological projects of the PRC [2014ZX07104-005].,,30,7,7,10,44,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1470-160X,1872-7034,,ECOL INDIC,Ecol.

In the French language literature on citizen participation and the social and solidarity economy, the term coproduction is little used. This paper investigates the narratives of French academics, public, and third sector actors in order to identify what, if anything, is different about the French context that explains this gap. Drawing on semistructured interviews, I identify four key narratives that distinguish the French conceptualizations of coproduction and the third sector from the dominant English language coproduction literature: (a) a mainstreaming of coproduction as part of organizational purpose in the social and solidarity economy, (b) an emphasis on formalized involvement of citizens in organizational governance, (c) the motivation of citizen empowerment and democracy over cost and efficiency, and (d) the use of the term coconstruction rather than coproduction. I argue that these narratives are shaped by the governmental traditions of France, which emphasize formal rules, hierarchy, representative democracy, and a suspicion of particularistic interests. I conclude by questioning the universality of some of the axioms of coproduction theory in the English language literature.","[McMullin, Caitlin] Univ Montreal, Pavillon Lionel Groulx,Bur C 8086, Montreal, PQ H3T 1N8, Canada",Universite de Montreal,"McMullin, C (corresponding author), Univ Montreal, Pavillon Lionel Groulx,Bur C 8086, Montreal, PQ H3T 1N8, Canada.",caitlin.mcmullin@umontreal.ca,"McMullin, Caitlin/AAV-2241-2020; McMullin, Caitlin/ABC-3750-2020","McMullin, Caitlin/0000-0002-7029-9998;",University of Birmingham,University of Birmingham,University of Birmingham,,57,7,7,7,37,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0144-5596,1467-9515,,SOC POLICY ADMIN,Soc.

Roads in large- and medium-sized cities are becoming increasingly congested, which leads to frequent traffic accidents. To enhance road traffic safety and reduce the traffic accident rate, effectively identifying accident black spots is of great importance. In this study, the data from traffic accidents on the Lianfeng Middle Road, Yinzhou District, Ningbo City were selected for the analytical dataset, and eight impact factors (holiday, day of week, time, rush hour traffic, accident location type, accident type, weather, responsibility and black spot) were set. The improved K-means clustering algorithm was proposed to solve the shortcomings of the traditional algorithm, which is susceptible to outliers and initial clustering centres. Through this algorithm, the traffic accidents in the dataset were divided into two categories: black spots and non-black spots. Then, using the updated dataset, we employed a Bayesian network to construct a black spot identification model, and applied other widely used algorithms (the ID3 decision tree, logistic regression and support vector machine) for comparison. The values of the ROC area, TP rate, FP rate, precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy reached 0.618, 0.668, 0.580, 0.650, 0.668, 0.590 and 0.668, respectively, which showed that the Bayesian network was the best model to effectively identify road accident black spots. Moreover, a bivariate correlation model was applied to verify the correlation between the impact factors and black spots. The results indicated that the accident location type, accident type, time, and responsibility had significant correlations with black spots, which had a value of sig0.05. The conclusions could provide reference evidence for the identification and prevention of traffic accident black spots to significantly contribute to traffic safety.","[Zhang, Cheng; Shu, Yue; Yan, Lixin] East China Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",East China Jiaotong University,"Yan, LX (corresponding author), East China Jiaotong Univ, Sch Transportat & Logist, Nanchang 330013, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",yanlixinits@126.com,,,National Nature Science Foundation of China [51805169],National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported in part by the National Nature Science Foundation of China under Grant 51805169.,,24,7,8,6,22,IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC,PISCATAWAY,"445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA",2169-3536,,,IEEE ACCESS,IEEE Access,,2019,7,,,,,,140197,140205,,10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2942647,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2942647,,,9,"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications,JN8QJ,,gold,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000497156000014,View Full Record in Web of Science

We also examine the determinants associated with migration by applying Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) estimation techniques. The results show that migrants move mainly from inland to coastal areas; however, since 2010, the number of migrants moving from coastal to inland areas has shown a continuous increase. This inter-provincial migration was driven largely by the influence of economic factors, such as high urban income per capita. A better model for the period of 2010-2015 is established by adopting an extended set of variables. New variables that represent regional disparities and industrial upgrades have a positive impact on inter-provincial migration, which shows that regional economic disparities and economic restructuring have played an important role in migration in recent years.","[Wu, Rongwei; Yang, Degang; Zhang, Lu; Huo, Jinwei] Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China; [Wu, Rongwei; Zhang, Lu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Xinjiang Institute of Ecology & Geography, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS","Yang, DG (corresponding author), Xinjiang Inst Ecol & Geog, Urumqi 830011, Peoples R China.",wurongwei16@mails.ucas.ac.cn; dgyang@ms.xjb.ac.cn; zhanglu113@mails.ucas.ac.cn; huojw@ms.xjb.ac.cn,"Zhang, Lu/C-4821-2019","Zhang, Lu/0000-0001-9002-621X; Wu, Rongwei/0000-0001-5510-5705; yang, de gang/0000-0002-2774-921X",Oasis Population Evolution and Transfer Way: A Case in Moyu County [Y435131001],Oasis Population Evolution and Transfer Way: A Case in Moyu County,This research was funded by Oasis Population Evolution and Transfer Way: A Case in Moyu County (Y435131001).,,45,7,8,1,35,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2071-1050,,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,NOV,2018,10,11,,,,,,,3899,10.3390/su10113899,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su10113899,,,22,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HC1AQ,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-04-26,WOS:000451531700073,View Full Record in Web of Science

The f-N curve is a common practice to express the results from past scattered accident data through curve fitting method, which only estimate the overall trend.

To verify the method, the following three sets of statistical data were selected and analysed in this study: 1932 accidents in over 95 countries (1931-2004) and 322 accidents in China (2000-2008) available in the literature, and 2046 accidents investigated in China (2013-2017). It was found that the mean value curve is almost identical or even better than the best-fitted curve, while the predicted upper and lower limits with 96% reliability (+/- 2 sigma) covering nearly all the statistical data are beyond the scope of common curve fitting. The result explains the inherent relation between accumulated frequency and deaths in different transport mode, in different country and at different period.

Owing to the unique advantages of the evidence theory, evidence decision flow fits in well with the cognitive process of human beings, which provides us with an effective decision method. However, traditional evidence theories are built upon the one-dimensional evidence recognition framework, which merely reflects the reliability of information determined by evidence source and as such may fail to present the characteristic information of evidence source itself or the information required for the process of determining reliability. This greatly influences processes in decision-making, such as evidence processing and combination. This essay aims to propose a two-dimensional evidence-reasoning theory to address specific decision problems. Design/methodology/approach - This article uses a two-dimensional evidence framework to reflect the process and characteristic information of evidence source based on the traditional evidence framework. As a result, evidence is processed and combined by two-dimensional modified information. Findings - This research is of theoretical and practical significance by extending theoretical connotation, fully utilizing precise evidence information and therefore meeting the requirements of efficient and accurate decision-making performances. Originality/value - The theory adds a two-dimension to modify and capture evidence on the basis of the traditional evidence framework. This proposal has significant theoretical and practical value to expand evidence theory and provides more accurate use of evidence information, higher efficiency and quality requirements and more precise decision-making.","[Zhu, Weidong; Ku, Quan; Wu, Yong; Zhang, Chao] Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, HongTao] Zhejiang A&F Univ, Sch Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yibo] China Merchants Bank, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China",Hefei University of Technology; Zhejiang A&F University; China Merchants Bank,"Ku, Q (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Sch Management, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China.",kq1949@163.com,"zhang, hongtao/IWV-4469-2023",,Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China [LQ15G010006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71774047],Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This research is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. 71774047) and Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Project No. LQ15G010006).,,24,7,7,3,18,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",0368-492X,1758-7883,,KYBERNETES,Kybernetes,,2018,47,5,,,,,873,887,,10.1108/K-05-2017-0156,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-05-2017-0156,,,15,"Computer Science, Cybernetics",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Computer Science,GE4HD,,,,,2024-04-26,WOS:000431175300002,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aims to explore the influence of environmental change on individuals' mental health and to improve current understanding of the mechanisms that mental disorders occurred. Methods: The data were extracted from a cross-sectional study. Anxiety disorders, mood disorders and substance use disorders were assessed using the Chinese version WHO-CIDI. The prevalence of mental disorders was stratified by migration status into ecological migrant, local resident and original resident groups. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate the risk of prevalence among these three groups. Results: After controlling for gender, ethnicity, age, marriage, and education, the migrants had lower risk of mental disorders than original residents [OR = 0.70 (95 % CI: 0.57-0.86)], p < 0.001), but had a higher risk of mental disorders than local residents [OR = 1.29 (95 % CI: 1.06-1.55)], p = 0.007).

This paper deals with the subject of social innovations and their application in social practice. It attempts to conceptualize social innovations within theories on the modernization of the society. It is based on a sociological understanding of social innovation as a source of social change and modernization as an example of social change. The importance of social innovations rises with the high dynamism of changes in late modern society, and with the growth of its structural and cultural differentiation, which diversifies, differentiates, individualizes and dynamizes man's social world. Social context has influenced a modified understanding of innovation not only as a tool and source of economic productivity and competitiveness, but also as a potential tool for achieving social goals and social cohesion in society. The social dimension puts more significance on the positions and roles of social actors as vehicles of innovation. The solution to social problems and increasing the ability of social actors to participate in the solution process has become an important condition for sustainable economic growth.

Land-use and agricultural regulations, designed for an industrial style of agriculture, are experienced as a threat to the survival of the Old Order Amish agricultural social economy and community. The paper describes how I have worked with the Old Order Amish to respond to these challenges and to create public policies that will allow them to maintain their human and agricultural diversity and small-scale sustainable farm practices. Four case studies illuminating the oppressive land-use regulations along with the emancipatory responses to the oppression are examined. The social transformation themes include principles and processes for community psychologists, land-use planners, and community economic development practitioners to consider. The article has heuristic value for a practice-based approach to social change.","Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Psychol, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Wilfrid Laurier University,"Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Dept Psychol, 75 Univ Ave, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",ebennett@wlu.ca,,,,,,,42,7,9,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0091-0562,1573-2770,,AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL,Am.

But the majority of researches focus on the natural driving force of land use change. In this paper, the authors studied the relationship between socio-economic driving factors and land-use change with time series in Hainan Island. Based on the study for the evolution of administrative system and policies in Hainan Island and the comprehensive analysis on the social economy data and changes of social policies, the socio-economic policies, human activities and land use of Hainan can be divided into three periods with different characters: period from 1950 to 1978 characterized by the planning economic system, period from 1978 to 1988 characterized by the transfer of economic system and adoption of open policy, new stage from 1988 to 1998 with high growing speed. On the other hand the authors describe the character of the periods and land-use change process affected by socio-economic factors. This paper provides an important method for evaluating the development and changes of Hainan social economy during the 50 years from 1950 to 1999 and forecasting the development of Hainan social economy in future.","[Xu Xin-liang; Zhuang Da-fang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zeng Lan] Natl Planning Comm, Inst Macroecon, Informat Consultat Ctr, Beijing 100824, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS","Xu, XL (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,9,7,7,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1002-0063,,,CHINESE GEOGR SCI,Chin.

To investigate the socio-economic impacts of different water diversion quantity from transboundary river basins, we used a system dynamics (SD) model to reflect interactions between population, water resources, and socio-economic development, and applied it to a case study in Xinjiang to simulate its change tendency from 2011 to 2030 from the temporal dimension. Then, four water diversion quantity of transboundary river basins and four alternative socio-economic development patterns were designed to comprehensively evaluate these impacts of water diversion quantity change on the socio-economy of the region along the river under different socio-economic development patterns. The results indicate that (1) there was a positive correlation between water diversion quantity and the economic output value of the region along transboundary river basins, and the marginal benefit of transboundary water resources would decrease gradually; (2) considering the difficulty of water diversion from transboundary river basins and the protection of downstream water use and ecological health of transboundary river basins, we believe that increasing the transboundary water resources by 20% was more conducive to the sustainable development of Xinjiang's socio-economy; (3) through the comparison of dynamic evolutions of socio-economic development and water impacts under four socio-economic development patterns, it is best for Xinjiang to plan its future development in the coordinated development of economic-resource scenario. Following this scenario, not only would the total output value of the socio-economy be better than other scenarios, but this also helps to alleviate the contradiction between the water supply and demand, which expected there would be a water shortage of 1.04 billion m(3) in 2029 under 20% increase in water diversion quantity. Therefore, appropriate water diversion quantity, reasonable adjustment of industrial production growth rate, reduction of water consumption quotas of different industries and domestic water quota, and improvement of collection and treatment rate for sewage should be given priority in water resources management decision-making in Xinjiang or other arid regions along transboundary river basins.","[Shao, Zhiying; Wu, Fengping; Li, Fang; Zhao, Yue; Xu, Xia] Hohai Univ, Business Sch, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China; [Shao, Zhiying; Wu, Fengping; Li, Fang; Zhao, Yue; Xu, Xia] Natl Engn Res Ctr Water Resources Efficient Utili, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China",Hohai University,"Wu, FP (corresponding author), Hohai Univ, Business Sch, Nanjing 211100, Peoples R China.;Wu, FP (corresponding author), Natl Engn Res Ctr Water Resources Efficient Utili, Nanjing 210098, Peoples R China.",shao_zy@hhu.edu.cn; wfp@hhu.edu.cn; lf@hhu.edu.cn; zh_yyyyy@hhu.edu.cn; 170212070004@hhu.edu.cn,"Wu, Fengping/GXN-4333-2022",,Major Projects of the National Social Science Fund of the People's Republic of China [17ZDA064],Major Projects of the National Social Science Fund of the People's Republic of China,This research was supported by the Major Projects of the National Social Science Fund of the People's Republic of China (Project No. 17ZDA064).,,53,6,6,5,34,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1660-4601,,INT J ENV RES PUB HE,Int.

Usually, hydropower project development has an impact on environmental geology and social and regional cultural development. Based on comprehensive consideration of complicated geological conditions, fragile ecological environment, resettlement of reservoir area, and other factors of future hydropower development in each country, we have constructed a comprehensive evaluation index system of hydropower projects, including 4 first-level indicators of social economy, environment, safety, and fairness, which contain 26 second-level indicators. To solve the problem that existing models cannot evaluate dynamic nonlinear optimization, a projection pursuit model is constructed by using rough set reduction theory to simplify the index. Then, an accelerated genetic algorithm based on real number coding is used to solve the model and empirical study is carried out with the Y hydropower station as a sample. The evaluation results show that the evaluation index system and assessment model constructed in our paper effectively reduce the subjectivity of index weight. Applying our model to the social impact assessment (SIA) of related international hydropower projects can not only comprehensively analyze the social impact of hydropower projects but also identify important social influencing factors and effectively analyze the social impact level of each dimension. Furthermore, SIA assessment can be conducive to project decision-making, avoiding social risks and social stability.","[An, Hui] China Three Gorges Univ, Hubei Key Lab Construct & Management Hydropower E, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China; [Yang, Wenjing; Huang, Ai] China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Hydraul & Environm Engn, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jin; Wan, Zhongchi; An, Min] China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China",China Three Gorges University; China Three Gorges University; China Three Gorges University,"Huang, J; An, M (corresponding author), China Three Gorges Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Yichang 443002, Peoples R China.",anhui0504@163.cm; 471416607@qq.com; huangjin@ctgu.edu.cn; 1329684770@qq.com; zhongchiwan@ctgu.edu.cn; anmin@ctgu.edu.cn,,"an, min/0000-0002-2288-7664; Huang, Jin/0000-0001-6973-6380","Hubei Key Laboratory of Construction and Management in Hydropower Engineering Fund of China Three Gorges University [2016KSD19]; fund of Research Center for Reservoir Resettlement, China Three Gorges University [2019KQ03]; Science Foundation of Youth Science Foundation Project, China Three Gorges University [KJ2019A001]","Hubei Key Laboratory of Construction and Management in Hydropower Engineering Fund of China Three Gorges University; fund of Research Center for Reservoir Resettlement, China Three Gorges University; Science Foundation of Youth Science Foundation Project, China Three Gorges University","This research was funded by Hubei Key Laboratory of Construction and Management in Hydropower Engineering Fund of China Three Gorges University (no. 2016KSD19), the fund of Research Center for Reservoir Resettlement, China Three Gorges University (no. 2019KQ03), and the Science Foundation of Youth Science Foundation Project, China Three Gorges University (no.

In recent times, the alpine steppe in Northern Tibet has been severely degraded, that is, plant biodiversity was reduced and plant coverage declined. It is crucial to restoring the degraded alpine steppe in Northern Tibet to maintain the sustainable development of the environment and social economy. This study aimed to evaluate the ecological engineering benefits of four types of ecological restoration treatments: (a) independent treatment of sowing plant seeds; (b) combined treatments with (a) and fertilized microbial inoculum; (c) combined treatments with (a) and spraying hydrophilic polyurethane (which can enhance the ability of moisture retention, fertility, and temperature in the soil subsystem); and (d) the comprehensive treatments with (a) and fertilized microbial inoculum and spraying hydrophilic polyurethane. Noting their effect on plant growth performance, plant taxonomic and functional diversity, soil physicochemical properties, and soil microbial diversity in the degraded alpine steppe. Plots where no seeds were planted and no other amendments were applied were selected as experimental controls. Plant height, leaf size, plant taxonomic and functional diversity, total carbon and nitrogen contents, soil bacterial and fungal diversity were significantly enhanced under the four ecological restoration treatments. Plant growth performance (in particular, competitiveness for sunlight acquisition and leaf photosynthetic area), and soil fertility were significantly enhanced under the four treatments. The improved plant taxonomic and functional diversity and soil microbial diversity could facilitate the biological communities in degraded alpine steppe to develop better ecological functions, especially community stability. Meanwhile, the combination of all three treatments was found to be the best among all treatments applied in this study. This can help restore the degraded alpine steppe in Northern Tibet.","[Wang, Congyan; Wang, Shu; Wu, Bingde; Wei, Mei; Rong, Xinshan; Li, Yan; Du, Daolin] Jiangsu Univ, Inst Environm & Ecol, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Congyan; Wang, Shu; Wu, Bingde; Wei, Mei; Rong, Xinshan; Li, Yan; Du, Daolin] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Environm & Safety Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Jiangsu University; Jiangsu University,"Wang, CY (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Inst Environm & Ecol, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.;Wang, CY (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Environm & Safety Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",liuyuexue623@163.com,"Du, Daolin/HHC-9359-2022","Du, Daolin/0000-0003-1764-2205; WANG, Congyan/0000-0002-6132-3319",National Key Research AMP; Development Program of China [2016YFC0502002]; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Technology and Material of Water Treatment,National Key Research AMP; Development Program of China; Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Technology and Material of Water Treatment,This study was funded by the National Key Research & Development Program of China (2016YFC0502002) and Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Technology and Material of Water Treatment.
